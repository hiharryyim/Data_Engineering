11.0,Star Wars,2000.0,"Star Wars is still terrific fun and wonderfully entertaining.; Ford is hilarious, and it is still the
funniest part he has ever done.; 'Star
Wars: Special Edition' is a grand opportunity for everyone to enjoy it
all over again and for a new generation to experience a wonder which
will remain just as strong in 2077 as it does today.; It's not a perfect film, but it's a heck of a good one.; Aside from being possibly the ultimate movie experience -- emotional and
visceral -- this time, STAR WARS surprised me with how subtle a good deal
of it is, something I attribute to seeing the movie after what feels like a
whole other lifetime of experience.","Not that
it's bad; it's just not very meaningful.; To try to tell or synopsize the Star Wars story would be a waste of time.; The robots are all we have on offer for approximately 15
minutes, I even considered somebody had taped 'Lost In Space' over the top
of this copy of the video.; ( Why, oh why, couldn't Lucas
use computers to substitute better performers in the lead roles? ); What does, however, is the awful scene in which Jabba the
Hutt appears."
13.0,Forrest Gump,1983.0,"A lot of fun.; It's still 
a great film, and an opportunity to see this generation's Jimmy Stewart 
in fine form.; Gary Sinise, in one of the 
most beautifully constructed supporting roles in history, gives an 
astounding, career-making performance as Lt. Dan, one of Forrest's 
closest friends.; Hanks handles a very demanding role very
well, the script is excellent, and Wright (who obviously appreciates
the chance to show she is an actress, not just a princess) is also
excellent.; This is a tonic for the weary of heart and spirit, and
a rare gem in summer's crown.","It's good for some laughs here and there, but the laughs are only worth 
it if you have a working remote control in your hands with your thumb on 
the fast forward button so when ""JENNY"" comes on screen, you can 
fast-forward (not that Robin Wright is bad, but her character's an omen 
to whip out those Hefty-brand jumbo-size barfbags).; Many movies are about people who are unintentionally depicted as stupid,
and are therefore boring to watch.; Gump's character is none of those, and I
don't think either Zemeckis or Hanks knew whether to play Gump for
laughs or for drama.; All in all, SPEED was nothing but a cheap thrill, and quickly
forgettable.; Take out
the music and you have one dull film that would not
""inspire"" half as much as has been claimed by some
reviewers."
14.0,American Beauty,,"Highly recommended.; Highly recommended.; This is a rare and outstanding film that deserves
attention and will challenge some heady competition for a place as the
best film of the year.; Still a
strong film.; ""Beauty"" also has another
hauntingly effective score from the always refreshing Thomas Newman
that is genuinely sublime.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; You¹re boring.; On the basis of this horrible ending, I'm tempted to call the movie a 
thematic mess.; * * - Pretty bad.; As
if that wasn't enough, too, writer Alan Ball even goes one better, by having
Lester's narration be from the grave, pace Traces of Red, Carlito's Way."
16.0,Dancer in the Dark,1998.0,"This is one special
film and in some ways fantastic.; Fallon is also terrific, having a similar effect 
as Stormare, syphoning our emotions as witness to Selma's fate.; His answers are mindful and often
times sown with a subtle, dry, biting humor easily missed, unspoiled by his
poker face.; David Morse also turns in a
fine understated performance.; It's Stormare who takes
up the arc of slowly discovering the buildup of tragedy which engulfs Selma
and it's a terrific performance.","It was the only
thing in the film that seemed to be innovative and chancy, as for once
the director stopped exploiting the poor dumb woman for a brief respite,
before carrying on with making her into a martyr.; (pause) I thought it'd be potentially something awful.; (pause) Actually I was really disappointed.; Thus, many of the scenes look
choppy as if you were looking at a home movie.; Because apparently people don't concentrate because there's
nothing for the eye, only for the ear, and I was like ""Uhhggg."""
28.0,Apocalypse Now,1999.0,"It's an incredible film and a
classic, but it's not quite perfect.; Highly recommended.; But
still it is an amazing achievement worth many viewings.; Duvall's portrayal as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore is terrific, and, he
provides a number of memorable quotes.; The scenes are bold, inventive, and powerful, and 
the acting is stunning, especially be Sheen, Duvall, and Fishburne.","The dialogue is 
confusing, the lighting is atrocious, and the scene drags on for 10 
terrible minutes of film.; The scenes are poorly done, the dialogue is muffled, and the whole mess 
is utterly confusing beyond all belief.; Perhaps it would have been more fitting if Marlon
Brando's final words were ""what a mess"" rather than
""the horror"".; It doesn't make too much sense.; The entire journey is supposed to 
be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like Kurtz, but the 
scenes fall way short of expectations."
63.0,Twelve Monkeys,,"Brad Pitt gives a deliciously over-the-top 
performance that, while derivative of Jack Nicholson's more memorable 
roles, is nevertheless enjoyable -- enjoyable, but not superlative.; It's a chilling, 
almost gothic, sequence that perfectly establishes the film's dark mood.; an
*excellent* example.; Twelve Monkeys is a fine film and I recommend it highly to anyone who 
comes close to the Perfect Person profile above.; As scrutinized as he can be, Pitt is an
excellent actor who caters to a variety of characters.","Bruce Willis is a disappointment as always (if only someone 
can wipe the smirk of his face).; The movie his fans call his 'masterpeice',
""BRAZIL"" I think is a boring mess.; Maybe if the director had chosen some other actors or if the 
characters in the movie were not so caricatured it would be little 
better than pass.; While script, settings, and production design are obvious strengths 
of TWELVE MONKEYS, acting is not.; Living underground to escape the deadly surface air, science has
somehow progressed to make time travel a possibility, just not a very
accurate one."
66.0,Absolute Power,2000.0,"He's as good of a
director as he always was, and that alone makes the film enjoyable.; What a great and
original plot!; The next year he followed that up by directing the equally
excellent ""A Perfect World"".; What makes Eastwood so good is not only his diversity in
subject matter from 'Play Misty for Me' (1971) to 'Unforgiven' (1992) but his
uncanny ability to take films with relatively long scenes and stretch them
into the most absorbing films made anywhere by anyone.; To boot, Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman do a great job acting their
respective roles.","Not only is the plot
unbelievable and contrived, but even the writing itself lacks any
consistency or intelligence.; Embarrassingly bad as the President, Hackman wastes his
great talent on a poorly written character.; Harris' character
was a pathetic single cop, with a likeness for Whitney's daughter, Kate
(Laura Linney, Congo).; Besides the ridiculousness of the plot, some of the acting is
terrible.; Unfortunately, the premise does not live up to its potential."
71.0,Billy Elliot,1994.0,"A memorable soundtrack adds luster to
this little gem of a movie.; Finally, a bloody good 
film about the human soul and the triumph of the human spirit!; Finally, a bloody good 
film about the human soul and the triumph of the human spirit!; As his
father, Gary Lewis is tough-yet-tender, and Julie Walters scores as
Billy's crusty yet compassionate teacher.; Young Billy has a natural desire to dance and, with the help of
the obligatory muse Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters, ""Educating Rita""), overcomes
every obstacle - principally the prejudice his father has toward dancers, who
must be poofters.","It's just not cool to be the
FGMOTY anymore, and the films that try to shoot for FGMOTY status
usually fail miserably by cramming schmaltz down your throat (i.e., Pay
It Forward).; Billy actually takes up boxing but lacks the drive and the 
attitude.; Billy actually takes up boxing but lacks the drive and the 
attitude.; For instance; the typical
and unsurprising shots at sexual discovery, the completely pointless
presence of a cross-dressing, gay schoolyard buddy as a pretense for God
knows what--it just comes off cheap and stupid--and a happy-go-lucky
ending that made everyone in the audience (except for two fat ladies
directly in front of me) want to regurgitate their popcorn and Kit Kats.; Debut screenwriter Lee Hall has thrown this film against the backdrop of
the 1984 English miners' strike, adding richness to the otherwise banal
family drama."
73.0,American History X,1999.0,"CRITIQUE:
Intense, powerful, stylish directorial debut from British director Tony
Kaye, pulls together all aspects of dramatic achievement, including a
solid and emotional story line, an original film style and solid
performances by its cast, most specifically, the genuinely flawless
portrayal by Edward Norton.; This harsh, beautifully crafted film is actually upsetting to watch,
it is so intense.; Norton delivers a blistering, volatile, and intelligent performance
that explores his contradictions, and builds upon his superb credits
in Primal Fear and The People Vs Larry Flynt.; Yet X displays its history of skinheads
in a powerful, haunting tale of hate vs. love.; Many of the actors in the supporting cast are excellent as well.","Even Derek's descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justified.; While ""American History X"" depicts an over-crowded America replete
with exploiting free-loading border-jumpers and unemployed blacks, it
fails to bring the real problem into focus.; Even more unnecessary is the contrived
device in which Danny is forced to write a history paper on Derek's road
to ruin, leading to a resolution that feels disappointingly pat.; A script
going in a different direction from Derek's transformation would have
helped solve this problem.; The first 20 to 30 minutes were
aggravated slightly by some stiff dialogue and sticky acting."
75.0,Mars Attacks!,1988.0,"is
brilliant.; Jack
Nicholson acts for perhaps the first time in years, putting in a
surprisingly complex portrayal of the President.; They are is a great score by Danny Elfman, and lots of laughs.; ""It is an awesome sight.; Combine that with some
ingenious computerized special effects and the cultural lessons of all
those tacky flying saucer movies of the 1950's and 'Mars Attacks' delivers
some surprisingly inventive gags and justice is done to the characters in
the picture that you'll love to hate.","There are too many characters, too little 
story, and too much unfunny and repetitious material.; And when it doesn't work,
it's just dull.; The movie just
plain looks bad -- too bad to be taken seriously, but not bad enough to
look bad on purpose.; Eventually the film
is doing anything it can to milk laughs from the material in the worst
traditions of THE CANNONBALL RUN.; I was very disappointed when Michael J."
76.0,Before Sunrise,2000.0,"Because the atmosphere is so realistic, vivid, and believable we identify
with the characters and almost become them.; Even though
reality finally steps in, our memories of these emotions will stay with
us.; But leave your pre-conceptions at the door, and you will be rewarded
with a nearly perfect romance, a sweet, funny and poignant character
study which, if there is any justice, will make Julie Delpy a star.; I keep returning to certain terms when thinking about and
describing BEFORE SUNRISE--perfect, genuine, real.; He uses the train as a
perfect metaphor for time.","Honestly, whoever wrote this silly script, why bother
going to such enormous lengths to build intellectual companionship
(which will deepen with time), and then confuse the issues with a single
night of gratuitous sex in the park?; It's not as if the viewers
paid to watch a movie called 'Before Sunrise' just so they could see two
kids jerk off.; It was too 50s beatnik looking.; They see sights, visit a record store, an
amusement park, a grungy bar with awful music, a string of cafes.; BEFORE SUNRISE is likely to be a very polarizing kind of film,
because it consists almost entirely of conversation between Jesse
and Celine."
77.0,Memento,1997.0,"It's the smartest noir thriller since ""The Last
Seduction,"" the most brilliantly structured film since ""Timecode,"" and the
most mesmerizing mystery story I can remember seeing in a long, long time.; Carrie-Anne Moss gives her first truly great performance here as the 
mysterious, duplicitous Natalie, exuding both toughness and sincerity with 
equal aplomb.; Unfathomably, the film gets
progressively better as it goes along, and I found myself inching closer
and closer to the edge of my seat throughout the movie.; It is rare 
for a noir tale like this to make us feel the internal anxieties and fears of 
its main character.; ""Memento"" is quite simply the best
film of the year.","Why does Nolan bring in the
character of Sammy (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man who has
apparently suffered a similar ailment as Leonard and whom
Leonard is investigating to determine whether Sammy's
affliction is an insurance-covered physical condition or an
insurance exempted psychological one?; Jumbled imagery fits together like pieces of an intricate jigsaw puzzle, and the audience is as confused as Leonard.; Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce, ""L.A.; Spit in his beer, or much worse, and a minute later 
he will remember nothing about the incident.; After a few minutes, if he fails 
to write down important information or clues (usually on a handy Polaroid he 
shoots of any person he meets), he will forget as if the incident had never 
occured."
78.0,Blade Runner,1999.0,"It's great -- just perfect.; For one
thing, this movie has a great theme, the greatest human theme: life,
death, and their meaning.; Score/Sound:  Vangelis, synthesized, but also some sax, I liked it and
it fit the movie.; M. Emmet Walsh (MISSING IN
ACTION, RED SCORPION), as per his usual, does a great job with his
role.; The film is very well written
and held my interest throughout.","On the surface, the plot of the movie looks like material
for cheap B-movie schlockfest.; Harrison Ford's annoying voice-overs have been removed and some of the
scenes have been rearranged.; The result is that the genre (especially in the 90s) has
become a synonimum for dumb and predictable ""popcorn films"".; And then there is the movie's look, which has been copied and slavishly
imitated in comics, in other movies, books, advertising, and God knows what
else.; I think Joanna Cassidy (DON'T TELL MOM THE BABYSITTER'S DEAD,
MAY WINE) was also a rather weak actress in this film."
79.0,Hero,1998.0,"Her sister Susie Cusack (part of the Evanston, 
Illinois Cusack clan) makes a lovely debut as Bernie's 
court-appointed, rookie lawyer.; He lives in a special twilight world of mental, 
psychological and physical debris.; Geena Davis, as Gale Galey, begins as the ultimate in electronic
sob sisters (Chevy Chase, her boss, says, ""Everyone knows you're a
marshmallow, now act like a professional marshmallow), but ends as a
real person whose job is TV news.; The story, written by David Webb Peoples, balances the comedy of a
very sharp media satire with the heart-warming story about the nature of
heroism.; In addition, Hoffman is heartbreakingly perfect
when Bernie begins to acknowledge his own deeply buried compassion and
love.","Then, 
for better or worse, we switch to a super-Capra, 
lump-in-the-throat Davis-Hoffman dialogue.; It 
is as though the filmmakers wanted to get every penny of their 
investment in Hoffman's star presence.; Here, John merely turns 
out to be a Vietnam hero.; Those overdrawn and overlong passages are also over-underlined 
by the many closeups that director Frears is so fond of, 
perhaps as a leftover of his old (and impressive) TV days.; All the 
scenes overdo his character as slobbish, egotistic and even 
feeble-minded, except for some quick-thinking, fast-moving low 
cunning involving illegal acts."
85.0,Raiders of the Lost Ark,1998.0,"Harrison Ford is perfect as the every-man with the
brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer, and Spielberg
manages to achieve the ideal balance of action, fun, adventure and humor.; The rousing, memorable musical score by the incredible John
Williams lends support and enhances our enjoyment.; CRITIQUE:
Astounding movie packed with non-stop action, stunts galore, an interesting
story line, great one-liners, a solid cast, a catchy musical score, and all
the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride.; Ford is in
great shape for his age but it won't last forever.; It is a thoroughly entertaining film, with some of the greatest
gee-whiz technical effects, stunts, and action sequences ever filmed.","The plot of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is utter balderdash.; It looks like a cardboard plane has just been destroyed
with cherry bombs.; Nor of sequels to come, I might add: witness Kate Capshaw's
unbearable hysterics in the follow-up TEMPLE OF DOOM.; Spielberg wasn't willing to let it simply
unspool before our eyes; instead he had to make it clear that he was
working hard behind the camera ( and as far as I know it's the only bad
movie he's ever made. ); In plain fact, I wouldn't
even see an Indiana Jones movie if Ford were not Indy."
88.0,Dirty Dancing,1997.0,"And you'd miss a real gem.; DIRTY DANCING is a good film too.; I went to see DIRTY DANCING because one of the critics on a NY independent
station loved it.; It's like real life and maybe, that's why
I liked it so much.; The Ayn Rand-trashing scene alone is worth the
price of evening admission.","As a movie, the cliche-ridden script by
Eleanor Bergstein is so bad that it almost becomes unintentionally
funny.; Based on the previews, you probably wouldn't go see DIRTY DANCING unless
you're either bored out of your skull or under 16.; The film's saving grace is that fully a third of the film has the
actors dancing rather than talking.; Easily, the worst part of the story is the self-imposed
second-class citizenship of the film's male lead.; Rhodes is as poor an actor as she is an incredibly
accomplished dancer."
89.0,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,2001.0,"It is lots of fun and often magical in its continuing
affectionate tribute to the serials of yesteryear.; Director: Steven Spielberg It is always refreshing to watch [again] summer movies from
previous years and compare them with current movie flicks.; Eventually, of course, the two men overcome their
estrangement to forge a relationship of warmth, tenderness, and mutual
respect.; Characterization is what makes Indiana Jones movies entertaining
and enjoyable.; The action is still
frightfully intense and surprising thanks to Steven Spielberg's assured and
strenuous direction.","The plot is also disappointing.; By contrast,
CRUSADE is too tame and fails to distinguish itself from imitators of the
series, such as ROMANCING THE STONE.; The film had a thin, brittle
edge that made the whole thing impersonal; it was as if Spielburg was so out of
breath doing his rollercoaster bit, that he never gave the audience the
opportunity to treat the characters as more than cardboard cut-outs.; The cast also includes Alison Doody as the requisite
love-interest, an Austrian art historian who has nothing in mind but her
own self-interests.; One disappointment is that they did a Nigel-
Bruce on Denholm Elliot's character (i.e., they turned a perfectly serious
and interesting character into a buffoon)."
95.0,Armageddon,2001.0,"But I laughed, too, at some very funny lines.; But I laughed, too, at some very funny lines.; It's also packed with a little more special effect fun
than a mere tidal wave sequence (As slick as that sequence was in the
earlier asteroid movie, it doesn't compare to all of the festivities in
this one.); So
even if you don't win one of McDonald's free tickets, it's still definitely
worth checking out.; And, I would definitely watch it
again.","Not even 
Bruce Willis can save this expensive, incoherent, derivative mess.; After all, doesn't bad
publicity generally mean bad movie?; I certainly don't care what their intentions
were, because Michael Bay (The Rock) is such a skilled director that I
doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through.; However, on the downside, Armageddon is let down by being completely
ludicrous.; The previews were so annoying that I
predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year, or at least in
the running."
98.0,Gladiator,1996.0,"Perfect.; It's a very good (and very creepy) performance.; Music by Lisa Gerrard (from the group Dead Can Dance) and well-known 
Hollywood score master Hans Zimmer is smooth and haunting.; It's solid.; It's both rousing
and chilling.","* - One of the worst movies ever made.; * * - Pretty bad, see it only if you have nothing better to do.; It
represents the worst kind of Hollywood excess, great sums of money
thrown at something ultimately pointless.; There's an instance of this earlier in
the film too that's disappointing.; Last year, early May brought us `The
Mummy', easily the worst film to hit screens in 1999."
100.0,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels",1997.0,"I enjoyed this film.; The twists and turns are well set up, yet unexpected and fun --
really fun.; A
moviegoing British public would probably identify it closely
with the 1970 film ""Get Carter"" starring Michael Caine in the
role of a small-time gangster investigating his brother' death,
a work by Mike Hodges that captures the seediness of the
petty rackets in England.; It's tight, tense, funand that's
that - lock, stock, barrel.; What eventuates from all this fun and confusion is very, very clever.","Neither plot nor characterization appears to be the selling
point of director Ritchie, who is eager to portray the milieu of
London's East End during his 36-day shoot, caricaturing the
neighborhood's bad-guy ambiance with Tim Maurice-Jones's
helter-skelter photography.; Every character in the film tries to be a character, succeeding only in
being a one-dimensional one, while women do not play a significant part
in this unoriginal film, as they are reduced to being go-go girls or
unnoticeable druggies.; Supplementing the cast are some particularly ugly
actors, apparently by the credits supplied by a special agency
dedicated to providing ugly actors.; ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" would be a
prominent piece of low-budget filmmaking if had appeared a
decade or so ago, but by now the genre is so tired, the
glorification of violent criminals so prosaic, that it rates simply
as an also-ran.; The
script doesn't do much to differentiate the characters within the three
groups."
103.0,Taxi Driver,1999.0,"***  = Excellent show.; Some of the hairdos make look dated, but the message it tells
is as powerful and frightening today as it was in 1976.; His Travis Bickle has a lot in common with
most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of
isolation, loneliness and outrage towards crime, drugs, prostitution and
senseless street violence.; I certainly was pleased with the remastered sound since the show
had great movie music (Bernard Herrmann).; I think the picture as delivered is
brilliant.","*    = Poor show.; 0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.; Over twenty years ago screenwriter, Paul Schrader, was in a terrible state.; Even
the politicians, like Senator Palantine, are lost in post-Vietnam and
post-Watergate mess; his broad and senseless ""messages"" that cover the
lack of any serious program can't fool even such idiots like Travis.; Palantine, a stereotype
of an ambitious, platitude-spouting politician, is
the only weak character."
105.0,Back to the Future,1993.0,"What makes ""Back To The Future"" such a gem is its ability to take elements
of adventure, comedy, and sci-fi, mix them all together,and make for a
wonderfully entertaining movie.; Fox's
portrayal of a character with whom all ages can empathize is central to
the film's timeless and magical allure.; With
intelligent and funny dialog and a strong cast of then minor league
actors, the film amazes one on subsequent viewings almost as much as on
the first.; ""Back To The Future"" is one of the greatest modern films.; Fox is perfect as Marty McFly, the typical teenager who
skateboards, plays in a rock band, and has a girlfriend - your basic ""cool
guy.""","Even the label, Calvin Klein, on Marty's clothes becomes the heart of
an ongoing joke.; Afterall,
who would put someone else's name on his own clothes?; Watching Biff's abuse
of George is the visual equivalent of scraping fingers across a
blackboard.; The film opens in the home of a nerdish inventor, Doctor Emmett
Brown.; Four heavily
uniformed men come running out like an Indy pit crew."
106.0,Predator,1994.0,"There is plenty here for the people
who complain about Tie-fighters banking and spacecrafts making noise to pick
apart, but it LOOKS real, and that is the important part!; It treats the human characters like game animals, stalking them
down, taking them one by one, and taking care of each kill before going out
again.; The thing that impresses me most is that throughout PREDATOR, the humans
have a chance.; The plot implications of a nearly invisible creature stalking
the commandos are well-handled.; The alien's actions are believable, and consistent with the idea it is a
sportsman.","Characters that started out as one-dimensional Rambos are
barely developed to the point of being two-dimensional Rambos, and most of the
dialogue is so stiff and unnatural that the characters seem to be announcing
important information for the sake of the audience, rather then talking to one
another.; Without the cloaking concept this would be
a fairly low-grade action film.; It
is indestructible and omniscient until the last five minutes of the last reel,
when the hero finds some laughably easy way to destroy it.; Any reason to drop 5 or 6 heavily armed men miles from
civilization would have worked just as well, so little time is spent here,
only long enough to let us know who the good guys and the bad guys are, and
then one obligatory battle scene so Arnie can use his patented groan-inducing
corny combat banter.; Action films are pretty common, but the concept of
     the cloaking device coupled with decent special effects are a
     boon."
111.0,Scarface,1971.0,"In the end, SCARFACE is a very powerful film
that hits home hard.; This isn't as meaty a role for Pfieffer as
Sharon Stone's was in CASINO, but its an effective one nonetheless and
she aquits herself well.; SCARFACE, although incredibly violent, is one of the best crime films of
its time and stands out as another great performance for Al Pacino.; Coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep,
whereas in SCARFACE De Palma opts for a grittier feel.; Tony also begins to
fall in love with Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), who at the time was Frank's
lover.","It's just not right, and
unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes.; The only major botch is Giorgio
Moroder's mostly crap synthesier score.; Another element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the
profanity.; Scarface is a movie that is absolutly desperate
for somebody's attention, and that is why you should
not give it yours!; ""Never do your own stash"", warns one
character early in the film."
134.0,"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",1997.0,"The other two scoundrels also
follow suit with top-notch performances of their own offbeat personalities
as do the rest of the cast, with plenty of fun and engaging moments of their
own.; It is a wonderful moment 
of moviemaking and gives us, in my mind, the best movie song of the year.; And despite this
film being a little slow at times, a little too long for its own good and a
little weak in the ""romance"" end of the story, it still managed to keep me
entertained for most its outing with plenty of peppered one-liners, a great
chemistry between the three leads, catchy tunes and a rock-solid performance
by George Clooney.; The sirens, the fame,
the power of Babyface are all brilliantly presented as part of a
supremely entertaining road movie.; A strong B+.","""It's dull!""; Not funny?; Other cast members mostly
go through the motions.; * * - Pretty bad, see it at your own risk.; The Coens refuse to invest any humanity in these 
characters so that every single situation, every actor, every line is 
reinforced with a robotic mentality that produces no chemistry, no interest 
and no imagination."
165.0,Back to the Future Part II,1995.0,"No real plot shocks or surprises   There's a sense of rushed
urgency in this film that was absent in the first BACK TO THE FUTURE film, and
this gives the film an edge (or at least becomes reminiscent enough of IT'S A
WONDERFUL LIFE to simulate one); however, what it adds in suspense, in takes
away from the one enjoyable friendship in the first film, the one between Doc
Brown and Marty.; ""Back To The Future Part II"" is a really great adventure movie.; The
cleverness and time-related in-jokes are pretty good, and the time-travel theme
holds together if you don't think about it *too* closely.; At the end
of the situation Marty has changed the course of history for the better, and
it seems like everything's copasetic right?; And I liked the car.","Fox seems to be trying to beat Cary Grant's record of
double-takes in ARSENIC AND OLD LACE, and while he's adequate, he's no Archie
Leech.; Doc seems to be in the picture merely to hustle Marty from
time-period to time-period, and (except for one pleasant sequence where Brown
bumps into himself), gets to show very little personality; his main
contributions to the film are the better historical jokes.; Depends how well you liked the original BACK TO
THE FUTURE PART II is more of the same; the good news, in these sequel-riddled
days, is it's not worse than the same.; ***1/2 (out of 4 = very good)
1989, PG, 108 minutes [1 hour, 48 minutes]
[adventure/sci-fi]
starring: Michael J.; Wrong."
169.0,Predator 2,1999.0,"Armed with a strong sense of personal responsibility and love of
comrades, one member of Species B alone triumphs.; And
yet...  the moral is a good one.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Bambi meets Godzilla.; The crazy thing is, we are supposed to believe that Species B wins!; It should make a short movie.; Impossible.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
172.0,Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,1993.0,"You cannot
trust your feelings, however powerful they are.; I saw STAR TREK II: The Wrath of Khan the other
night on the tube, and while that's arguably the best of the series, it shows
how a good script can add to a character without giving them a lot of screen
time.; His plan , though convoluted, is perfectly logical.; The bar in
Paradise City, for example, immediately brings to mind the Catina Bar in
STAR WARS.; Anyone notice the Imperial motif that Kirk carries around him?","Shatner's hackneyed story and heavy-handed direction make the film far too
self-serious and pretentious.; They are so crude and one-dimensional that
they fail to make credible adversaries.; As a
story, it's lackluster -- below average by even the STAR TREK: THE NEXT
GENERATION series quality average.; Certainly some of this might be laid at the door of aging
actors, but the vast majority seem to be due to an over-all attempt to inject
humor into the story at every point.; There are a lot of silly and even stupid scenes."
174.0,Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,2000.0,"I do, however, highly recommend this enjoyable and intriguing film.; The acting is superb throughout; this is
probably Shatner's best and most believable performance ever, and
although they may be getting a bit old, the rest of the crew's
performances are fresh and lively.; But
despite the hidden message and likeness to today's goings-on, this movie
is still a romp through space, where we meet and see all kinds of races
and places.; Anyone who
goes to see this movie can quite easily recognize which character
represents who in today's world.; But don't let that phase you--it's still a good movie.","Lack of adherence to IDIC (speciesist/ethnocentric).; Pretty predictable.; That one was
solved by the scriptwriter saying, ""Oh, didn't you know?; The solution
to the puzzle here is not as bad as that of the WRATH OF KHAN problem, but
it is bad.; He has one brief, no-talent-needed
scene."
184.0,Jackie Brown,1992.0,"Perfect.; Forster gives a
beautifully modulated performance of understated humor and panache; it is one
of his best character roles since ""Medium Cool.""; She's amazing.; The relationship between Max and Jackie is
especially well-done, and surprisingly moving towards the end.; Of course, nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of
   Pam Grier and Robert Forster as the two leads, and although the caper
   intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists, backstabbing, and
   deceptions deliciously unfold, the strength of JACKIE BROWN is the
   quiet, understated relationship developed between Jackie and Max;
   when they kiss, it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year.","All of this notwithstanding, JACKIE BROWN isn't a bad film or an
uninteresting one; it's just a disappointing movie.; His co-partner in crime, the always
reliable Robert De Niro, is unfortunately miscast as a rather lifeless,
boring sidekick, a role which should perhaps have gone to someone
equally lifeless and boring.; Unfortunately, De Niro is basically
wasted as his lines are few and far between, and then they are mostly
clipped sentences.; Why do people go to 
spend big bucks on a movie, and then bolt from the theater like they have 
something better to be doing?; I've heard some people say this film is boring; others talk about
the fact that it centers around immorality and that none of the
characters have any redeeming qualities."
196.0,Back to the Future Part III,1996.0,"Don't miss it, it's great fun.; I really liked this movie.; Rating:
     The movie's light, moderately fast-paced, and very enjoyable.; The ending is certainly corny, but fun.; Almost as much as I liked part one.","Worse yet, the movie doesn't seem to care if its story line is
consistent with the first two films.; But unfortunately, director Robert Zemeckis and
screenwriter Bob Gale somehow got sidetracked with the idea of making a
Western.; Gallons of slobber
dripping off of Mad Dog's chin in the first meeting with Marty must've
been left on the cutting room floor, so Mad Dog's name really didn't
make sense.; The plot is merely a sequence of ho-hum cliches, from the big
showdown to a train hijacking.; *** (out of 4 = good)
1990, PG, 120 minutes [2 hours]
[adventure/western/sci-fi]
starring: Michael J."
226.0,Boys Don't Cry,1995.0,"That damn documentary kept me up till 4:00 am, but it was well worth it.; Peirce draws uniformly
strong performances from her ensemble cast, comprising some of the
finest young actors working in the American independent film scene.; Hilary Swank brilliantly brings Teena back to life on the big screen, she is 
an amazing actress that in my opinion gives the best performance I have ever 
seen.; Sevigny's performance here is even better than her recent portrayal in
""American Beauty.""; It is simple in all its ROMEO AND JULIET tragic
romanticism, but complex because of the one major addition.","Director Kimberly Peirce has a toddler run
screaming through the worst of the mayhem, just to make sure we are
completely disgusted with the level of unspeakable violence before us.; Stripped of Brad Pittâs movie star
appeal, fighting in barrooms and stealing cars begins to look depressingly
low-rent.; It 'twas the night
before finals, a night filled with the worst kind of pre-performance anxiety
(well, maybe the second worse kind), but I was covered; I had studied with such
abandon (into the wee hours of morning) that my head was overflowing with
useless crap I would surely forget by the next week.; For better or for worse, depending on the viewer, Boys Don't Cry does
not spare us the details.; The long first part of the movie has nothing of interest, save watching
how Brandon copes with being a female in men's clothes."
268.0,Batman,1995.0,"The thing that makes this great is the wonderful black humor and 
intriguing action sequences.; It is a perfect entertainment.; He perfectly balances the film noir qualities with 
the humor.; Today.; Overall, this is probably the best superhero film ever made.","Query #3: It's just barely explained that the Joker is trying to make people
believe that his white-face is makeup -- why is this?; Unfortunately, it seemed to work much better as a series of clips.; BATMAN tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology,
but it fails to give us enough of either one.; Prince is awful, as are these songs, and they just don't gel with the look
and feel of the film.; Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Dent are given scant attention, which would
have been okay if the filmmakers hadn't tried to fill the space with two
unsatisfying new characters: some newspaper reporter who's name I can't even
remember and, of course, Kim Basinger as photojournalist Vicki Vale."
275.0,Fargo,1999.0,"I think the film is flawless,
brilliant, and certainly unique.; Still, it is one of the better and more original
crime dramas of the past few years, and well worth seeing.; ""Fargo"" is an example of great filmmaking in all aspects: original plot;
great acting; good scripting; and excellent direction that brings it all
together and makes it so breezy and enjoyable.; Steve Buscemi is hilarious as
Carl Showalter, the slightly smarter of the two goons, while Peter Stormare
is also quite funny as nearly mute Gaear Grimsrud.; I highly recommend you see FARGO.","It's
just not flattering -- not at all.; Everyone in Minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would
drive you crazy.; I felt like throwing
up when the wood machine thing was used for something real bad and
naughty, yah.; Oh, and then there's the ""attempt"" to add a message about, oh I dunno,
manifest destiny and the way we hurt the Native Americans (Lopez's
character is a Native American corrupted by an American).; Through the caustic hand of these film makers the moral
universe of which Marge is a relic is rendered inane."
280.0,Terminator 2: Judgment Day,1999.0,"Amazing inflation.; In short, I loved this movie.; The effects are
great, the action scenes are great, and the acting is great.; It involves some of the most amazing action sequences ever
executed, a story that's so engrossing that the film has become one of
the ten most defining films of the past decade (from the ""Premiere""),
and features good acting, and a good old paradox or two.; And Robert Patrick gives a perfectly delicious creepy performance.","In a typical film version of this, the action
sequences would be half-assed, and it would be as deep as a Seagal
film.; * * - Pretty bad, see it at your own risk.; Whatever it was, 
I've been sorry to see Furlong wasted on useless movies since his debut 
(""Detroit Rock City"", anyone?).; We really don't see any of that, and I
think it's too bad.; The storyline is, of course, predictable."
287.0,Bull Durham,2000.0,"It's refreshing
and honest: Shelton not only has his own oral fixation, he also knows what
baseball really is -- an oral sport.; He physically
encapsulates what we often see in failed or retired sports figures -- that
they seem quasi-boozed fatigued, not necessarily from the ever-handy
Miller's but from their sport of choice having nearly beaten out
everything inside them.; What humor it has is derived from
the interaction of believable personalities in believable situations.; You see, it's not all sex, she 
also teaches her young charges the rules and secrets of life.; Happily, Sarandon got Annie, and even more happily, she's
been decaffed, so we won't have to go through the feminist jitters, yet,
despite how wonderful she is -- and it's a performance that gets better
each time you see it -- I have to say that I've met very few women like
her Annie.","Considering the realities of baseball as I
perceive them, BULL DURHAM is of course too clever by half: I challenge
anyone anywhere to name players in one or any of the major or bush league
teams who could tell us who Susan Sontag is, much less what her books
might be about.; I
wept for days,"" she told Newman -- because, despite their enormous
likability, Costner's Crash is almost atypical of sports and Annie surely
is; they're too intelligently conceived, which, for a baseball audience,
is a major turnoff.; Take one or more comics established by being on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, SECOND
CITY, etc., and add a script full of jokes you would have to be blind AND
deaf to miss--by definition subtlety means someone might miss a gag.; (Though inexcusable,
this explains why Ken Burns omits Denny from that eighteen hour
error-filled snoozer ""Baseball""; assembling footage of the 1968 World
Series, Burns gives the viewers the impression that the St. Louis
Cardinals were victorious, instead of the Tigers.); There are other sports more boring than baseball but I can't think
of one I hate more."
289.0,Casablanca,1998.0,"Casablanca is, in my mind, no classic (like Solaris), but it is a good film
and stylishly shot.; ""Casablanca"" comes closer to perfection than any other
film that I have seen, and is probably the best film
ever made.; What makes ""Casablanca"" possibly the best film ever made?; The movie is very well done and the script top-notch, although
I doubt I understood more than half of the political mumbo jumbo.; Together with well-drawn characters and exciting story, the
movie was good in creating his own atmosphere.","Alright, =
alright, I'm jumping ahead of myself.; Unfortunately, the charisma that
burdened Laszlo, leaves little place for difficult choice,
making his character forever overshadowed by Rick/Ilsa
coupling.; That trailer doesn't come even close to capturing the
feeling of the film.; From time-to-time, someone tries to remake the film, but even the 
best re-tread has been less than a pale shadow of the original.; New
sequences include an additional exchange between Rick and rival club owner
Ferrari (Sidney Greenstreet) which did not make it into the original
version due to technical limitations."
290.0,Barton Fink,1994.0,"Great
     performances, great photography, strange film.; As the hyperactive studio mogul,
Lerner is hilarious; his animated delivery is deliciously energetic and
deserves an Oscar nomination.; Goodman, who has a near-perfect batting average in
supporting roles, convincingly plays Charlie Meadows as the ultimate common
man, but it's not until the film's finale that you realize just how
effective the performance has been.; If you go to the movies to see wonderful performances, this is a
choice for you.; That fascinating sense of the surreal is what this film is all
about - usual characters in most unusual circumstances.","Not 
a good omen for a writer.; Unfortunately, he is assigned to write a campy B
movie that has no value whatsoever.; It would appear that a movie about a blocked nerd of
a writer in a fleabag hotel would be about as boring as, well, spending
time with a blocked nerd of a writer in a fleabag hotel.; Every year, somebody posts the ""Barton Fink makes absolutely no sense and
never will"" post.; But the idea of a comedy-drama about writer's block sounds like it is asking
too much of even the Coen Brothers."
319.0,True Romance,1996.0,"It
is a must see movie that is definitely worth full ticket price.; This film is an excellent combination of brutal
violence and comedy, that should please fans of both.; TRUE
ROMANCE is the best film that I have seen so far this year, and is one
of the best films that I have ever seen.; The writing is excellent and the direction is excellent.; Both create a 
superb chemistry onscreen.","This is yet another example of a parable about crooked, one-dimensional drug dealers, pimps and cops but done with nary the style or witty dialogue that later became a trademark of Tarantino's after ""Pulp Fiction.""; There was no real emotional linchpin, like Mr.  Orange in RESERVOIR
DOGS, to engage me beyond the purely visceral, and I can only care
about a movie so far if I didn't care about any of the characters.; The camera wiggles and flies, bodies fly, there are loud sounds, 
but it's all a blurry mess.; Not a boring film overall but never truly enticing either.; More gratuitous violence ensues, and
eventually the film's attempt at being a serious crime story seems like just
too much to swallow."
327.0,Brother,2000.0,"He also, at times,
injects  humor  into violent scenes, taking the edge off of such sequences.; Known as Aniki (brother), Yamamoto forms a particular attachment to Ken's
friend Denny (Omar Epps, ""Love and Basketball""), ironic seeing as when
he first ran into him anonymously on the street, he shoved a broken bottle into
Denny's eye.; Yet Takeshi's exploration of the meaning of family has a resonance which
helps us overlook his film's flaws.; ""Brother"" is not likely to win new fans for Takeshi Kitano, but it's an
intriguing, if not wholly satisfying, addition to his oeuvre.; This weighty message isn't the only
barrier to enjoying Brother, but it's certainly one of the largest.","Instead, the two hours are basically spent watching the following: 
people go out and shoot each other, talk about it for ten-plus minutes,
then go out and do it again.; The rest of the
cast,  with  some  exceptions,  is there to be the fodder that the gang war
uses up in copious quantities.; Considering the utter
mediocrity  of  blockbuster  fare,  the  discerning  movie  maven  has some
alternatives.; Kids, don't try this at home.; Unfortunately the film doesn't give too much of an
explanation, assuming its audience is aware of Kitano's earlier work."
331.0,Jurassic Park III,1993.0,"Still, it's an entertaining and tightly-wound suspense yarn that, 
clocking in at 92 minutes, is over a half-hour shorter than the previous 
""Jurassic"" excursions.; The T-Rex itself is astounding, and the impressive soundtrack 
(recorded in DTS, digital sound, for the first time ever) enhances the 
credibility and realism of these creatures.; Still, this is a helluva good cast.; And the monsters, I
mean dinosaurs, are more realistic than ever, including some new flying
dinosaurs.; The
animated mascot explaining the cloning process  loved it.","The actor goes
through the motions as Dr. Alan Grant and is left to mouth such lines as
""Nobody move!""; Rating: 7 (0 to 10), low +2 
    (-4 to +4) Here goes my credibility.; Its two successors have been pale imitations, amounting 
to hundred-million-dollar B-grade horror movies.; It lacks scope and mostly looks as if the entire venture
was filmed on a soundstage.; Predictably, the plane crashes, 
a resourceful Spielbergian child is introduced, and Dr. Grant is forced to 
guide a bunch of greenhorns across dino-ridden wilderness."
334.0,Magnolia,1997.0,"Structurally, this is a very good film.; But it's well worth it for
adventurous filmgoers.; The characters are beautifully brought to life by the
performances of the ensemble cast, many a familiar part of Anderson's
regular repertory company.; He dreams of a perfect world.; Hall has
a positively stunning, heart-wrenching breakdown on the game show,
Robards is chillingly effective as he croaks out his untold confessions,
and Walters is phenomenal throughout.","And that wouldn't be so
bad if there wasn't a laughable moment -- straight out of one of those
Gap commercials -- where all the characters sing the same song, one
after the other.; It's just bad, no two ways about it, and the fact that this endlessly
mind-numbing music overlays several equally mind-numbing sequences of
boring, overlong exposition.; 'Magnolia' is an over stuffed stinker that reeks with pretentious
situations and over written scenes of ulcerating ugliness.; Never even attempting to bring the stories together into
a satisfying whole, Anderson instead ends the movies with a ridiculous
conclusion introduced completely out of left field.; Often when a filmmaker attempts to construct his film solely out of themes, the
end result is manipulative and pretentious."
345.0,Eyes Wide Shut,1993.0,"This is one of the best films of the year, provocative and intelligent.; The film is excellent in its portrayal of a bored married couple and
it is excellent as a dark mood piece.; This is probably his most mature and
serious part and he is incredible - greater and more powerful than ever.; It is beautiful, sensual,
at times creepy, gothic and mystifying.; The shot is so perfect and
beautiful that it establishes Kubrick's theme immediately - we can observe
sexuality but from a distance.","Friend #2 called it ""unquestionably the worst movie I have
ever seen in my entire life.""; Regardless, It is boring as hell.; It is definitely a waste of your time.; That would have been
giving viewers something predictable; instead, ""Eyes"" confounds
expectations again and again.; Is it because the 
screenplay is lacking?"
363.0,Head On,1992.0,"Ana Kokkinos' fiery Melbourne-based film is a tense and bold character
study - one that is almost haunting in its realism.; Kokkinos boldly looks at
sexuality, ethnicity, drugs and gender in a raw and explicit manner.; His actions are
not always understandable - but that's how people are sometimes.; This is a
powerhouse Australian film that is in many ways more confronting than
the likes of Saving Private Ryan, for the reason that it depicts issues
that are very real in today's society.; ""I'm not going to make a difference, I'm not going
to change a thing,"" concludes Ari late in the film, and while most people
are afraid to admit it, that's pretty much the futile fate of every
single person on this planet, regardless of what good one attempts to
make of one's life (a certain recent outside event has certainly taught
me that); it's just that Ari bears no illusions about himself or how the
world works.","The acting is mostly angry, and some of the sex scenes looked contrived.; The reason why Head On is so
uncomfortable to watch is because its director knows how to use
unsettling images for intrigue, not for shock appeal.; Perhaps a better choice of movies next time Alex Dimitriades
- the profile of angry, rebel, homosexual, drug addict will not
necessary boost your career, even if you did show your dick for the
world to see (a trick used too often nowadays by wannabe movie stars).; Oral
sex with an obese, Chinese grocery store man, oral sex with a dirty old,
Greek man, oral sex with a lesbian, and oral sex with a Caucasian hunk.; Limiting the emotional success of this
story is its lack of characters; aside from Ari, there is really nobody
else the audience can relate with."
364.0,Batman Returns,1989.0,"Pheiffer is an excellent Catwoman, the first foe who is a worth physical
adversary to Batman in the series.; I had a wonderful time.; I highly reccomend this one for being 
fun and still very deep.; Another Batman triumph for Burton and Keaton, BATMAN
RETURNS has all the strong performances, cool action, great direction,
gorgeous design, and powerful music of the first film.; It is
still extraordinary good.","It's horrible!; Instead there is a
Christmas Tree.; It's big; it's silly; it doesn't work.; The ridiculous costume hinders him
and reduces the character to a rather uninteresting goon.; Oh wait, I can't
blame you; I can only blame the filmmakers who shoehorned you into this role."
379.0,Miller's Crossing,1995.0,"This is a definite ""must-see"" film.; It's a film that almost
requires multiple viewings, not because of the complex story, but for the
sheer pleasure of watching it.; * * * * - Great flick.; We get a vision of life without love and
trust and the ethical codes that come from respect for other human
beings.; Here, we get a barage of
wonderful performances from everyone, like Gabriel Byrne's wonderfully
stone-faced performance, hiding himself under his facade; Marcia Gay Harden
playing oblivious to what she's doing and ending up showing a different
side of the traditional mob moll; John Turturro's wonderfully energetic
performance; Steve Buscemi's wacky little cameo; Mike Starr doing another
fine small role as a doofish hitman; J.E.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; * * - Pretty bad.; Oh well, I'm
basically nitpicking I suppose.; We're not even given an introduction here.; Unfortunately, this film has come and gone in most areas (or, more
likely, not come at all)."
380.0,Rain Man,2000.0,"Besides making THE NATURAL--perhaps the best sports film ever--he
made an enjoyable film about salesmen of aluminum siding, and, of course,
his two best-known films, DINER and GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM.; Hoffman delivers an astonishing
performance, not only is his character touching because of his innocence, but
he is also quite funny and gives the film a lighthearted tone.; This is an excellent movie, which has perhaps one flaw.; These days we see a lot of films about outsiders and how they see and
fit into our society.; Charlie's particular handicap is also familiar, and from a
source much closer to home; I suspect many will recognize it, in those close to
them and in themselves.","Overturn a
box of toothpicks and he can almost instantly count them just by looking.; Tom Cruise does an adequate acting job and no more is really
necessary.; If Hoffman fails at
all in this film, it is in not  really giving us enough insight into
Raymond's mind.; Apparently, Charlie's father left three million dollars to another
beneficiary.; The actual beneficiary
is Raymond, an autistic savant."
403.0,Driving Miss Daisy,2000.0,"In his first dramatic role, Dan Aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and
unexpectedly effective as Boolie, Tandy's loving and patient son.; The film met tremendous success at the Academy Awards, 
winning Best Picture and Best Actress (Tandy) while the 
two male leads received nominations (Freeman and Dan Akroyd, 
who in a supporting role plays Tandy's practical businessman 
son).; Freeman turns in as good a performance as the story allows him.; DRIVING MISS
DAISY is a movie about human nature, aging, prejudice, and a great many
other things, but more than anything it's about a relationship: one that
spans 25 years, 4 cars, the advent of civil rights, and one gravely
important 33 cent can of salmon.; Freeman, as Hoke, on the other hand, gives the more distinctive of
the two performances.","The salmon was supposed
to be Daisy's evidence that Hoke, her black chauffeur, was a thief.; To make
matters worse, she is extremely self-conscious about what others might
think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand.; Tandy plays the part of Daisy exceedingly well, but unfortunately
this feisty, cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace.; In DAISY, the biggest confrontations of the whole film involve a can of
salmon and an insidiously phrased sentence by a cop.; Rating: low +2."
414.0,Batman Forever,1996.0,"***** - Excellent.; The score is great, so great I bought it ... well worth the
US$17.99.; I highly recommend BATMAN FOREVER.; This is a very funny movie at times.; Jim Carrey was *superb* as the Riddler, didn't overplay as much as
I was expecting which was refreshing.","I am sorry, but this was just a terrible movie.; But the worst mistake is to have too many spectacular but
incoherent action scenes.; The character is full of so many possibilities, to waste on
""I'll get drive-thru"" is absurd and simply a let down.; Don't see it; it's a waste of time
** - Not very good at all, probably not worth seeing
*** - Average.; Chris O'Donnell was the biggest disappointment."
415.0,Batman & Robin,1997.0,"Gotham City is wonderfully, breathtakingly brought to life.; The visuals
are even better than in the other films, and many of the set
pieces are fun and exciting.; Sure, Forever had a different look and a different -- more action
-- feel to it, but it was a fun film.; It boasts great FX, good chemistry
between the leads, and two outstanding villains.; Plenty of kiddy fun to hate or appreciate.","Akiva Goldsman's screenplay for the film is ridiculous and
laughably bad, with astonishingly terrible dialogue, lame
jokes, and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts
along and fails to generate any genuine excitement.; Poor, poor Elle.; Freeze, and is bland and uninteresting,
perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be.; There is no plot anywhere,
and the ""dialogue"" is unrelentingly shallow, preposterous, and boring.; Cliche ridden dialogue and incoherent situations are bad enough and
on the technical end there is sloppy editing and badly choreographed action
sequnces which are repetitive and boring."
424.0,Schindler's List,1994.0,"This eqsuisite, beautiful film is a rare gem.; But with SCHINDLER'S LIST, Spielberg has crafted a nearly
perfect film, a gripping and brilliantly acted epic which is not only
the best film of 1993, but probably the best film of the decade thus
far.; From the
start, as Schindler sets about casting his nets on German officers in a
nightclub, the atmosphere is genuine, from the chiaroscuro lighting of such
places (it also recalls films noirs and dramas of the 1930s and 1940s) to
the music : ""Gloomy Sunday,"" a popular Hungarian song so downbeat that
(it's a fact) it encouraged many a suicide; other period tunes, jazz, the
tango ""Jealousy""; martial music, including the German's favorite march
""Erika.""; SCHINDLER'S LIST, ""Oscar""-awarded
1993 film by Steven Spielberg, may not be the best among
them, but it is definitely the best known.; Unlike most of the other stories that inspired filmmakers,
story of SCHINDLER'S LIST is an excellent opportunity for
all those who want to have a broader perspective of the
Holocaust, perspective that transcends simple formulas and
simple explanations.","Another poor, stupidly
inadequate word.; It was also the word that became almost universal
synonym with the worst evil imaginable.; Actors were, however, outshined by director.; He failed to use lighting in any reasonable and consistent
way.; His name is
synonymous with God in the land of box-office receipts and account
books--so when he announced that he wanted to shoot a drama about the
Holocaust that was over three hours long, and in black-and-white, no
less, then who was in a position to say no?"
431.0,Cube,1997.0,"The first-time director Vincenzo Natali creates an incredible
atmosphere.; No other
director can touch Cronenberg's portrayal of the intensity of
human frailty and decay: the technique of giving corporeality
to anger, disease, dread and hope with films like ""Dead Zone""
(about a man able to see the end of life in anyone he
touches), ""Videodrome"" (which depicts how films and TV alter
our notions of reality), and ""The Fly"" (a screwball romance
about the kinship of freaks with the rest of us).; The film is a representation of the human being
-- the specter of emotions, an analysis of the human mind and human
nature.; You won't ever know what's going on, but yet it's still
entertaining to watch.; Diana Magnus' fascinating art direction is an incredible
achievement.","One set, five actors, bad acting, even worse dialogue and a sadistic 
director.; Maurice Dean Wint is terrible on screen, absolutely 
terrible.; Their interactions are forced and uninteresting.; The use of dissolves to denote the passage of time is
not nearly as irritating as Mr Diablo usually finds it but he would
prefer that film makers realised that it just looks plain hokey.; But, this all unravels as the film slows to a 
grind and becomes increasingly more and more boring."
451.0,Leaving Las Vegas,1999.0,"The direction
is great (with Mike Figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of Las
Vegas and the moody, smokey atmosphere of a film noir) and it contains two
of the best performances to come out of the 90s, or any other decade for
that matter.; I strongly recommend this
marvelous picture and amazing acting, and I give it *** 1/2.; The effectiveness
of the message underscores the strength of the performances by both
Cage and Shue; each depiction is intensely persuasive.; In a year with many films about
relationships, this is one of the most unique.; I loved him--I really
loved him.""","4) I use the phrase ""not interesting"" but not ""unappealing"" or 
""depressing.""; But ""uninteresting"" is a 
liability.; But
here, I could not imagine any actor could have done a better job with
this role.; 2) A drunk of his caliber and a prostitute of Sera's type are 
not intrinsically interesting.; Even so, his character is so limited by the script 
that he did not engage my attention sufficiently."
454.0,Romeo + Juliet,1997.0,"This is not a perfect 
film, but it is a brave and often brilliant one.; Not perfect, but still quite good.; It's this closing scene that makes the
film - it's moving, stirring and perfectly captures the tragedy of the
story.; Harold 
Perrineau's Mercutio is charismatic throughout the film, and at times 
he is superb.; But I think it is easily one of the best and 
most important films of this year.","And
DiCaprio's awful performance doesn't help.; When the
director calms down-- and he does, regrettably-- the movie also slows
down and the badly delivered dialogue starts to sink the story, instead
of anchoring it.; Frankly he goes far too over-the-top - the camera-work is
dizzyingly frenetic going on incoherent.; The
result is a mess.; Though, to be fair, an interesting complete failure."
468.0,My Own Private Idaho,1999.0,"Highly
recommended.; Wonderful.; The film has a great sense of humor, and Van Sant
presents the film as having great comic timing.; To those of you who haven't discovered Van Sant yet, there is a lot here
and you will be rewarded for taking a chance, but look up his older
work, too.; The unique vision and occasional beauty of this superb
movie has enspelled me, and I want to be gripped by it again.","If played
straight, this would have had depth, but been an awful cinematic
experience.; This would be alright...if
the characters were gay.; By the end I hated River Phoenix's character and
hoped that he never met his mother just because I wasted my time sitting
though the film.; The only redeeming quality that this film has, and the only reason
this film even received a one, is the cinematography -- especially the
Idaho sequences.; Any one
of these could have been a movie by itself and the end result of such
richness is not, unfortunately, greater richness for the audience but
instead a scattered and unfocused movie experience."
469.0,Stranger Than Paradise,1998.0,"But what
Jarmusch has discovered is that these odd little moments in the lives of
ordinary people can be just as entertaining as murder mysteries or alien
invasions.; In STRANGER THAN PARADISE, those characters are Willie (John Lurie), a
Hungarian immigrant who has lived in New York City for the past ten years;
his friend Eddie (Richard Edson); and his cousin Eva (Eszter Balint), who
has just recently left Hungary and is on her way to Cleveland to live with
her Aunt Lottie (Cecilia Stark).; When Willie tries to get her to watch football, she says it's a
stupid game, and when he buys her a dress she doesn't like, she tells him
straightforward, ""I think this dress is kind of ugly.""; Because her aunt is in the hospital when
she arrives, she needs a place to stay for ten days, and ends up at
Willie's apartment.; And I can also
imagine myself first in line to see it.","Of course, if I took this premise to a Hollywood producer and pitched it as
a script, (s)he would probably look it me as if I'd lost my mind.; It's certainly not overwhelming (nor should it
be), but I can think of few other films in which a director managed to get
so much out of so little.; At
one point Jarmusch keeps his camera on them for several minutes straight
while they do nothing but drink beer and stare at the floor.; Jim Jarmusch has been quoted as defending his often meandering films on the
grounds that since life has no plot, there is no reason that film or
fiction should either.; ""Yeah, so what?"""
473.0,Pi,1997.0,"PI transports us to 
a world that is like yet unlike our own, and, in its mysterious 
familiarity, is eerie, intense, and compelling.; It's a intense portrayal of a paarnoid and claustrophobic life.; Gullette makes up for inexperience with
determination and energy, and delivers one of the most inspired
performances I've seen this year.; Sean Gullette, playing Max, has a strong, eerie
presence, and Ben Shenkman adds wonderful color as Lenny.; Thus bgegins Darren Aronofsky's 1998 independent trek into the surreal
Pi, an incredibly complex and ambigous film filled with both incredible
style and subtance.","--
Alex Fung (aw220@freenet.carleton.ca) | http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~aw220/
""...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
 sponsor is generally a pathetic fetus of a film, nothing more.""; But it just needs a better script.; The former is implausible,
strains credibility, and is ultimately pointless.; However, despite all of that, Pi fails as a film.; ""Pi"" is a difficult to watch."
479.0,Shaft,1995.0,"Take a hip character, a decent story line, a bit of violence, a bit of
action, an awesome score and some great performances from Wright, Bale and
the bad mutha himself, Sam Jackson, and enjoy this film as the gritty urban
crime drama that it is.; The movie is a perfect summer film, completely enjoyable with lots of
action.; Luckily, it is a very good one.; True, but it is rare to see a fun, exciting,
truly spirited action picture like this one, and Jackson makes it more
so with his titanic presence and his unduly sarcasm.; Wright delivers a fascinating performance that manages to
become even more mesmerizing by his Godfather-like speech.","""Mission:
Impossible 2"" is a bad example of providing a villain that would not
even scare Barney the Dinosaur.; The plot is a muddled mess, motivation is preposterous and some of the
characters are ridiculous, almost insulting.; In fact, that's the biggest problem with this movie; the entire 
thing felt old and tedious.; The movie just jumps from one scene to another without any cohesion or
thought.; CRITIQUE:
Is this a ""bad"" movie?"
483.0,Wild at Heart,1993.0,"At first, I was
blown away with this movie and thought of it as one of the
best films of 1990s, truly remarkable event.; But what made Blue
Velvet Êwork so well was its mind's-eye view through its lead character
Jeffrey Beaumont, as he descends from quiet small-town innocence into a dark,
frightening world and ultimately fights his way back out.; Laura Dern as Lula is a
stunning heartbreaker, and Nicholas Cage as Sailor is a sympathetic
character ...  and the VILLAINS!; Cage managed to make
him both funny and human in the same time; we both laugh at
him and sympathise with his plight.; WILD AT HEART is still an interesting piece of
cinema and it can still provide intense viewing experiences,
at least for those who watch it for the first time.","Watching ""Wild At
Heart"" is almost like watching a failed attempt to make a ""David Lynch movie,""
as if a novice director set out to copy Lynch's imagery and then didn't know
what to do with it.; Laura Dern puts
too much effort to make her Lula as different as possible
from squeaky-clean all-American girl from BLUE VELVET; the
result is creature that engages in chain-smoking, swearing
and torrid sex and, unfortunately, has disturbing tendency
to make rather unappealing facial expressions.; Her mother,
played by Laura Dern's real mother Diane Ladd (who deserved
""Oscar"" nomination for this role) plays one of the most
embarrassing incarnations of evil in the history of cinema -
sex-crazed, drunk and downright stupid creature, way below
the high standards set by Wicked Witch of the West.; And sometimes it goes too
campy, also undermining its build -- and Lynch's preoccupation with
weirdness sometimes goes beyond his unusual sense of aesthetics into
something like affectation, too self-consciously and ""traditionally""
avante-garde, as if he is throwing these things out just to confound the
sort of film analysts who like to reduce stories to pointless
meanderings about meanings and symbology.; Well, bad news: it wasn't, at least not consistently."
489.0,Good Will Hunting,2000.0,"It's a good movie, highly recommended.; It resides now in my mind and in my heart, and
also occupies the #3 spot for best movies of the year (#1 is LA
Confidential, #2 is As Good as it Gets).; Damon is astonishing--easily one of the best
performances from a young actor in recent years.; Damon is excellent as the wasted genius.; I highly
recommend ³Good Will Hunting².","Van Sant's direction is inexplicably amateurish and features
some lousy voice dubbing.; The screenplay is riddled with old movie cliches, and is as
predictable as any other.; Hype?; Maverick Gus Van Sant, has now directed a movie with mainstream appeal and
predictable developments.; The film draws false parallels to
Ramanujan and Einstein, neither of whom had Will Hunting's broadband
versatility."
500.0,Reservoir Dogs,1999.0,"The result is one of startling effectiveness, as we are
moved -- ever so slowly, ever so subtly -- to the robbers' point of
view, always finding ourselves back in the warehouse after recalling
bits of (our) past, all the while growing impatient at the waiting and
fearful of what the future may bring.; Even putting aside the compelling performances; the well-drawn and
quirky characters; the no-nonsense -- yet slightly tongue-in-cheek --
tone of the film; even putting aside all of that, this effect is above
all why RESERVOIR DOGS is so interesting -- and so compelling.; It has been a superb year for films that are both low-budget but
very high-quality -- terms that for most Hollywood executives mix about
as well as oil and water.; Tarantino is an excellent writer and a talented director.; The difficult violence is mingled with humor.","In the worst case, he will be merely an imitator.; The opening
scene in which the criminals debate the meanings of Madonna's lyrics, for
example, is funny and would have been fine in a Richard Linklater movie, but
here it just seems like a waste of time.; Neither of these have much plot relevance but are given 
ample time to develop, like the Captain Koons gold watch speech in 
PULP FICTION, only here these sequences are more enjoyable than 
the rest of the movie.; The only
exception is the police agent and I am not sure that it is justified.; Another quality of this film is the lack of psychology."
509.0,Notting Hill,2000.0,"Surprisingly light and fun overall, ""Notting Hill"" is good solid
entertainment.; This combination 
brings forth a brilliantly fun and beguiling film, that ranks among the 
best date films of the 90's.; Great
stuff.; Also effective in 
minor roles are Tim McInnerny, as William's brother, and Gina McKee, as 
his crippled wife, who share a few nice scenes together, and whose 
relationship is believable and touching as a married couple who love 
each other with all their hearts, no matter what.; Notting Hill is nonetheless
enjoyable; on the visual side of things, I especially appreciated
Michell's playful changing-of-the-seasons number.","Overall, a video rental at best, with a few grins here and around,
a fun and dreamy premise, but ultimately too repetitive, unconvincing and
just plain boring, to recommend with any enthusiasm.; Notting Hill really did nothing for it's two hour plus running time
except infuritate me.; Through this ridiculous plot contrivance,
William overhears Anna talking to her co-star before a take.; To make matters worse, it goes on too long with too few 
laughs.; Instead the clever repartee comes exclusively from Will's
pals, making one almost think (mistkenly, I believe) that
director Roger Michell is trying to make yet another satire on
the emptiness of celebrity."
510.0,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,1997.0,"However, what we do get is an
enjoyable (and often hilarious) piece of strange human interaction with a
battle against authority.; I think you will find, its one of the BEST ever.; The greatest message of all in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest""
is that humanity and freedom can conquer all adversity.; All
in all, an excellent supportive cast.; Jack
Nicholson, who as always plays his character absolutely excellent, and makes
the viewer want hand him an Oscar himself.","However, this fails to compensate for the lack of enticing material in
the movie.; The movie is inconsistent: shifting from being
tedious to being very effective.; St-st-stuttering Billy Bibbit's name even sounds
like a stutter.; Rather it is the repetitiveness of the rest of the story, which circles
aimlessly for more than two hours.; Her
hair looks like horns, implying that she's a devil twisting these
poor men into obedient servants of her rules."
513.0,Fire,1997.0,"(""There is no word in our language to describe what we are
and what we feel for each other,"" Radha tells Sita.); Kulbushan Kharbanda is excellent at playing a pompous icon of self-
righteousness and Jaaved Jaaferi is equally detestable as the 
philandering newlywed.; It's the new India's voice.; The film has an excellent score but some problems with its photography.; They do not ""come out""
but are brought together the way some affection-seeking, lonely boys and
girls do in same-gender schools.","The doctors' explanation was ""No eggs,"" which sounds like a
grocery sign in World War II rationing.; Although the acting is pleasant enough, the script by the director
suffers from a paucity of ideas.; Editing,
Barry Farrell.; Probably bent on imparting a realistic look to a
suffocating environment, it went to the extremes of avoiding reflectors and
extra lights, with the result that some scenes are unnecessarily dark or
murky.; Though much praised in some quarters, the camerawork suffers from what may
be excessive purism."
522.0,Ed Wood,1997.0,"It is respect which is the
greatest gift Ed gives him, and Laundau's portrayal of his slow return
to humanity is one of the finest pieces of acting this year.; Now, years later I get the answer, in the
form of a brilliantly crafted film by Tim Burton.; It has a great sense
of mood and is very clever overall.; Depp and Landau play very well together and
really make this relationship work.; Delivering a performance full of warmth,
humor and sorrow, Landau once again proves that he is one of the best
character actors working today.","The result is a batch
of truly awful Ed Wood films.; Imagine making a movie about a director, Edward D.  Wood Jr., who
was voted the worst director of all time.; Not only that, Ed Wood made
what is widely credited as being the worst movie of all time, PLAN 9
FROM OUTER SPACE.; It fails at this, however,
as Wood uses stock footage liberally and spices it up with Lugosi.; The
problem is that with the exception of producing some really terrible
plays he has no experience relevant to making films."
524.0,Casino,1998.0,"The soundtrack, while not as great as the one for ""Goodfellas,"" is
nevertheless amazing, and enhances every scene it is used in.; Don Rickles is surprisingly
effective in one of his rare serious roles.; Great, you are certified to see this
film.; Great soundtrack, too.; Any way you slice it, ""Casino"" is still a stunning work of art by Scorsese, and
it ranks as one of the best crime films ever made.","Too bad,
because this might have been the one that convinced me mob movies
aren't all so bad.; The third, and final hour of CASINO lacks something.; To complement
this, the violent Nicky sticks to dull grays and black outfits with
little character.; I've got no problem with drama, it's melodrama that bothers
me.; Unfortunately, what they're given to work
with is what trips the movie up."
544.0,There's Something About Mary,,"Brilliant, it
ain't; brilliantly executed, it is.; In fact, this may even be the funniest film I've ever had the pleasure of
seeing (the only real contender is ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail""), and
most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade.; And one of the most refreshing.; In one of the funniest and
darkest comedies this year we have a mixture of the vile and the
hilarious, that will keep you simultaneously shocked and amused at the
same time.; Surprisingly, the additional depth makes the
humor all the more funny (because we're finally able to see it in
contrast).","So, shall I leave you admitting
that There's Something About Mary is pretty darn funny, or should I
emphasize that it lacks even the most pathetic attempts at depth and
intelligence?; --

""...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
 sponsor is generally a pathetic fetus of a film, nothing more.""; Ted gets a fishhook caught in his mouth and it's just a waste of footage.; Her breasts
are even worse.; I found them quite
useless, unfunny and distracting."
550.0,Fight Club,1999.0,"Excellent appetizer!; The two begin fighting
and discover it an enjoyable experience.; This is an engrossing, entertaining movie, original, visually kinetic
and viscerally exciting.; A definite must-see for all!; The ending is amazing.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; * * - Pretty bad.; If that were developed further along in the
storyline, then there would be some intellectual challenges to a film
that tries very hard to be nihilistic but fails miserably to make a
cogent case for that belief or whatever it is trying to say, such as the
drivel about this being a film about freeing the masculine soul from the
shackles of a consumer society.; To begin with, this movie is not even remotely appropriate for younger
audiences.; It just doesn't work any more for Jack."
562.0,Die Hard,1994.0,"It's a great deal of fun.; And it also makes a great stocking
stuffer.; In
TRAVELLING NORTH, the answers are respectively good and very good.; The film
deals with intelligent people having a relationship in their twilight years,
and all in all it does it quite well.; But even while he is constantly flirting with
death, McClane always has a witty comeback for his foreign opponents,
and Willis is fluent and enjoyable as he barrels his way through
punchline after glorious punchline.","However, in
DIE HARD the director probably said ""Don't be doing Seagram's Wine Cooler
acting in here, or you're outta this flick.""; Unfortunately, star Bruce Willis, director John McTiernan and company
couldn't duplicate the heart-pulling thrill of the first one with two
increasingly mediocre sequels.; It seems to be a little *too* high on action...seems to be
something happening every minute after the first 20...which is probably why the
few people who *were* somehow bored with this movie didn't leave (I'd guess 3,
out of a theatre of 1,000 or so).; Must've been a convincing
director.; The only things these characters do is slow
up the story and ruin the pace."
568.0,Apollo 13,1994.0,"Very well thought out,
very well executed.; Kevin Bacon gives a good, solid performance as the hotshot pilot
Jack Swigert.; The movie, while being an
intelligent and well thought out thriller, also becomes a sentimental
film about the limits of human ability ... and the ultimate human
triumph.; This is a definite *must see* movie for 1995.; It's a bit of a cheat to single out Hanks for attention: while he
gives a perfectly fine performance, this is very much an ensemble
piece, just as the whole American space programme has been.","For starters, the first thirty or more minutes of the film are 
way too boring and unnecessary.; Cinematographer Dean Cundey's images were
okay, but nothing special.; It was exactly 45 minutes into the show
before anything of interest happened.; The computer text on the screen
at Mission Control looked like they came off of an off-the-shelf IBM
PS/2, and a few of the controls on the space vehicles looked like they
came from the modern-day Space Shuttle.; Not one person in this movie was miscast."
577.0,To Die for,1999.0,"All-in-all, a wonderful
production, well worth your seven bucks!; Dillon does a great job of playing
sweet buffoon Larry, who just wants a nice girl to settle down and have
his babies.; She
is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue, which Kidman
delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way.; She is always upbeat and smiling, and
she explains that ""It's nice to live in a country where life, liberty,
and other stuff, stand for something.""; Time passes, though, thanks to the
playful chemistry between Stallone and Banderas.","Lydia is supposed to be chunky and unappealing.; As far as the term ""thriller"" is
concerned, TO DIE FOR is completely off base.; She seduces all three kids in some fashion, but watching James fall
hopelessly in love with this monster just isn't funny.; Dillon, for example,
doesn't have much of a part, and he certainly does nothing memorable
with it.; It's enough to make you wonder what he's doing
with this script in the first place."
578.0,Jaws,1995.0,"I'm still not sure whether this is a good
thing or not, but there's no doubt in my mind that `Jaws' is a great film, one
that, like other Spielberg masterpieces, stays with you long after your viewing
experience is over.; All three actors
had wonderful interaction, both in the scenes of male
bonding and exciting but very realistic and believable
action scenes.; It's a wonderfully entertaining
mix of crisp dialogue, terrific performances, and first rate direction.; Hamilton
also gives a great supporting performance.; There are 
hysterical moments of hilarity, placed beautifully in sequence as to 
elicit the desired response.","On the other hand, such minor flaws were not
the authors' fault and insistence on them would look like
unnecessary nit- picking.; A killer
shark is killed and thought to be the shark responsible for the deaths of
the two victims.; Announcer: ""And what did she say when you grabbed her?""; It began something like this... Announcer: ""We are here on the beach, where a giant shark
has just eaten a girl swimmer.; It's not fair to blame the Star Wars trilogy ( or at least not the
first two ) and Jaws for the current down  pour of dumb movies made by dumb
people in the hopes that dumb parents will take there dumb kids to the dumb
theater."
581.0,Dances with Wolves,2000.0,"This originality and sense of character
is what makes the film so great and touching.; It may not be the best film of 1989, but it has a
sort of timeless quality that will hold up for many years.; Go see it in a good theatre with a good sound system so you can
enjoy the things it does well.; Despite a few flaws, ""Dances With Wolves"" is excellent for what it is.; It works well because it's on a human scale and it
portrays human foibles.","LITTLE BIG MAN, unaccountably
popular, attempted to be sympathetic but gave the impression that the
writers knew nothing about American Indians.; There isn't much
dialogue because the two people cannot speak the same language.; That's what's wrong with
this film.; That is so very very wrong.; The idea of a white man adopted into a tribe is alluring but
insufficient material for real drama."
600.0,Full Metal Jacket,,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket  is a bit disconnected at times,
but its investigation into the training and battle experience of American
soldiers sent to Vietnam is so unrelentingly dark and intense that it still
makes for a noteworthy ""Vietnam movie.""; ""Full Metal Jacket"" answers that
question, and demonstrates that there is always room for a
great film, even if the genre has already been thoroughly explored.; This is not a narrative
film so much as an intense slice-of-life work.; These films were
brilliant because they discussed things that were valuable or poked fun
at certain issues in frightening ways.; and the best basic training movie.","She
yelps, ""Shoot me"" endlessly in this rather painful scene.; He just
seems to be a piece of garbage floating around in the wind.; After a rabble-rousing first 5-10
minutes, the absurdly funny drill sergeant becomes repetitive and boring.; FULL METAL JACKET is a disappointment.; Mentally and physically incompetent,
Pyle fails at almost every test and constantly makes dumb mistakes."
601.0,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,1995.0,"The second act is certainly the best as there is an easy going atmosphere to
it.; succeeds in
that area because it has a little bit of everything to it; comedy, science
fiction, and an overall warm and fuzzy feeling.; Kids, especially siblings, are always fighting
with each other, which can make for great comedy when done right.; Mixing magic
and children always makes for melodrama, and that happens here when E.T.; The
mood constantly switches from comedy to lighthearted drama.","makes Elliot's bike fly, but this detracts from the credibility (if he could
fly, couldn't he just fly home?).; Almost no details are given
about these secret characters, because their faces are never shown, and their
actions seem to be depicted in such a blatant ""bad guy"" labelling manner.; However, it does stumble a
bit as it tries to carry three genres simultaneously.; and Elliot seem to be dying, and when the scientists walk into the
house wearing astronauts' suits, the credibility factor continues to drop.; There is also the use of the joke where the mother, Mary
(Williams), is always in the wrong place at the wrong time and if she would
only turn around she would see E.T."
602.0,Independence Day,1998.0,"It's perfect!; ""Independence Day"" isn't Shakespeare but it's still very
excellent, it might not be the most realistic story but I think that's the
point.; The Fresh Prince is surprisingly 
refreshing as the wise-cracking jet pilot who becomes earth's last hope.; This is a great film, and I am happy to be
pushing it.; Rarely does a film come along that is such an excellent blend of excellent
storytelling, suspense, and adventure and is able to synchronize it as
well as this film does.","Such a waste of his talents.; With its hackneyed plot, feeble attempts at characterization, 
and predictable finale, the second half of INDEPENDENCE DAY becomes an 
extremely dull and lifeless affair.; Unfortunately, because the film makers mistakenly tried to 
inject a load of weak dramatic elements, INDEPENDENCE DAY turns out to 
be overlong, overblown, and overdone.; Why, oh why, do I always believe the hype?; Here, he just seems like a grown-up asshole trying to be funny."
617.0,Wild Things,1997.0,"I loved it.; Rubin-Vega is a
newcomer but gives a wonderful performance.; As to performances -- having never been a big Matt Dillon fan I was
pleasantly surprised at how good he was in this film.; He gets great help from friend Murray
who is the funniest he's been in a real long time.; FINAL AWARD FOR ""WILD THINGS"": 2.5 stars - an enjoyable movie.","This character looks to be one of the most boring, predictable in the 
film.; Even the director looks like he's unable to
figure out what kind of movie this is supposed to be.; It's a film that features
awful dialogue, some really bad acting, too many twists, no one protagonist
to follow and admire, and some truly ridiculous moments.; Wild Things is by far an example of how to make a
movie so bad that it actually looks good.; The acting is incredibly reminiscent of Fox prime-time soap operas, which no,
is not a good thing."
620.0,Ghostbusters,1999.0,"If you haven't seen The Ghostbusters, I highly recommend this film.; His nerd
accounting character is wonderfully funny and provides for a lot of laughs.; Dany
Aykroyd is good as his more serious, but also flawed
colleague (his cigarette is nicely drawn character trait).; All actors give great performances.; The well-written script by Dan Aykroyd and
Harold Ramis gives each character a distinct, sharp, and intelligent
personality.","Luckily, wjen the humour fails,
director tries to compensate it with good special effects.; And the evil EPA man (William Antherton) trying to shutdown the
Ghostbusters.; Watching The Ghostbusters in
Pan and Scan format takes away from the film.; However, despite such Pavlovian
reflexes, I am ready to admit that Reitman occasionally did
rose above the levels of mediocrity.; That
process was anything but painless, and now I feel uneasy
anytime someone mentions phrase ""high concept""."
621.0,Grease,1993.0,"It is a fun movie, and
while it may not be anywhere near perfect it is a great experience.; CRITIQUE:
Fun-loving, energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler.; Distributor: Paramount Pictures GREASE is a perfect way to become immersed in the recent past.; It 
certainly isn't a momentous film, and stands a considerable distance 
downslope from the pinnacle its genre, but it became a huge hit in an 
era when the musical was well into its death throes.; Of course, this is a very different age from the Golden Age of
movie musicals, a more cynical one.","Secondly, a lack of talent.; It's easy to assume that a hit like this would be a
launching pad for its twenty-something actors and actresses, but in
fact, almost none of them went on to meaningful film careers.; Maybe even a mediocre
musical reminds folks of a cinematic vitamin deficiency they didn't even
known they had.; Probably the only let-down of ""Grease"" is how little it did for its
performers.; The plot is thin and transparent but has to be that way so 
that all the production numbers and requisite scenes (dance contest, 
drag race, etc.)"
627.0,Trainspotting,1999.0,"Ewan Mcgregor is plain awesome as Renton, and the supporting play is 
very solid indeed - sick boy is amazing.; Most of the humor is visual with a subtext of isn't addition fun
and funny at the same time.; The rest of the cast, including Miller and Bremmer among others is 
absolutely fantastic, but the best two performances come from Robert Carlyle 
(as the insanely brutal and blunt drunk/jerk Begbie) and of course, Ewan 
McGregor.; His speed-induced enthusiasm at a job interview
makes for memorable cinema.; The thumping dance and rock soundtrack, while 
very prominent, is never obtrusive and perfectly creates and compliments the 
mood of the film.","***Considering the massive hype (in the UK), the film is basically 
disappointing as a whole.; Here the movie fails in its intent.; In the first half, we get pleanty of jokes and some plot development as
Renton and his four mates (Spud (Ewen Bremmer), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller),
Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and Franco (Robert Carlyle)) spend there time
basically going out on the town of Edinburgh.; In another scene, Mark dives into a public toilet labeled, ""the
worst toilet in Scotland.""; In ""Shallow Grave"" he showed a group 
of obnoxious flatmates who turn on eachother when a suitcase of money is 
found."
635.0,Angel Heart,1988.0,"I 
especially think the ending twist is highly imaginative.; While
there can be occasional minor buildups and releases, overall there has to be a
heightening sense of mystery and peril.; Looking back, I think
that a good job was done in translating the feel of the story to the screen.; The story is set in 1955, and involves a PI, Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke)
hired by a mysterious stranger named Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro) to find
Johnny Favorite, who welshed on a debt he owes Mr. Cyphre.; Starring: Mickey Rourke, Robert DeNiro, Lisa Bonet, Charlotte Rampling
Directed by: Alan Parker
Produced by: Alan Marshall and Elliott Kastner
Executive Producers: Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna
Screenplay by: Alan Parker
From the novel: ""Falling Angel"" by William Hjortsberg
Director of Photography: Michael Seresin I saw this movie at a special pre-release screening here at UCSD.","The worst offense is the
seemingly obligatory horror scene that turns out to be a dream.; Certain scenes are dragged out for no obvious reason, and
several mystery cliches are needlessly added.; I hope that if they change the film at all, it is
the use of judicious editing to tighten the film and remove or trim the slow
spots.; In this movie, if you have too much time to think, the film loses.; Before
the movie started, there was a trailer stating something to the effect that the
version we were seeing was not a finished product, and that color, editing,
etc."
638.0,Lost Highway,1999.0,"It is a one-way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind,
and as such it is gripping, intense, and brilliantly effective.; To truly
appreciate  this artist with no art, Lost Highway is a must see.; David Lynch's second best film to date is perfect evidence of what
makes him fascinating as a filmmaker; he has always since day one made
the types of films you normally have to earn the right to
make.; There is little doubt in my mind that, when he is working at the top
of his form, David Lynch can turn our darkest unspoken fears into
brilliant cinema like no other living director.; Bill Pullman, who normally plays Mr. Nice Guy, is a solid choice 
for LOST HIGHWAY's most prominent role.","To label the film as egotistical ,
nonsensical, and amateurish would be an insult to films I have
previously considered as bottomfeeders.; And I'm sorry, if I watch something that
makes absolutely no sense whatsoever (and ultimately isn't MEANT to make any
sense), I do not enjoy it and therefore cannot give it a favorable review.; After that he's grown hopelessly self-conscious and self-important, but
those are not the worst of his problems as a director.; Three words: lack of  plot.; Again ""Lost
Highway"" sets itself in a category that has been reserved for the
absolute worst of the worst."
639.0,When Harry Met Sally...,1997.0,"It's a classic romantic comedy that is impeccably written,
wonderfully acted and beautifully shot under a fantastic musical umbrella of
love, fate and supreme friendship.; Watching Harry and Sally grow and mature and their relationship
develop is fascinating and moving.; His dark
side makes him pessimistic and cynical, but it also gives him a biting,
sarcastic sense of humor.; Ryan's
red-eyed, rag doll hysterics are spot on and beautifully realized.; Their authenticity is refreshing, their motives
and behavior thought provoking, enough so to inspire inner reflections of
our own.","(One final note:  Nora Ephron (a female) has a male character express
the philosophy that a male cannot just be friends with an attractive woman
without wanting sex with her.; Nora
Ephron, the script writer, just filled in a blank labeled ""Occupation""; she
did not create a character.; And I'm awfully manly.; WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... is all right as a piece of
entertainment for a little while, but it is by far reiner's worst film.; I had the feeling
that when these people walked off camera they winked out of existence."
641.0,Requiem for a Dream,1998.0,"It's a harsh film but with excellent technical
attributes and fine performances by Burstyn and all.; CRITIQUE:
A harrowing tale about the extreme damage associated with addiction and the
pursuit of happiness, this film should be applauded for taking such a
familiar subject matter and slapping it around with innovative visuals, a
haunting score, undeniably courageous performances from all of its leads and
a consistently gripping narrative.; So why isn't it one of the best films of the year, if not _the_ best
film?; In an April 18, 1999 interview with the British newspaper, The Independent,
Selby takes aim at American society: ""The fascism in this country today is incredible.; It's
not an easy film to find comfort in, or feel anything but revulsion at
the sight of the constant degradation of human beings taking place.","She is a 
woman who no longer lives her days but merely endures them, whose future 
seems destined to consist of nothing more than the same tedious routine.; Leto
tries out a New York accent here, but mainly just offers more of the
same blank stares that made him so popular as the dim-witted Jordan
Catalano on My So-Called Life.; By the film's end, not much substance came through all the stylishly and
graphically depressing experiences the four main characters underwent;
what I mostly felt was tired from their actions and not wanting to see
any more of their hellish experiences.; In short order, Sara wears the same junkie shoes
as her younger co-stars.; How does a guy with talent this marginal keep getting cast in cool, edgy
films, like American Psycho, Fight Club and The Thin Red Line?"
644.0,A.I. Artificial Intelligence,1998.0,"It is haunting and
surreal, moving and beautiful.; Love it or hate it, it's a triumph of 
innovative film-making, a blend of science and humanity, and a 
brilliant collaboration of two acknowledged masters.; His absolute and unwavering adoration is both heart-rending and chilling (the
way Osmont utters the word ""mommy"" is one of the most powerful and controversial
moments in the film).; And Spielberg's visuals are stunning, perfectly 
complementing ""A.I.; He
would have missed that compassion and the love, and humanity - the heart, which
Spielberg always had and which is truly what makes us human.","is nothing more than a rambling,
pointless, godawful boring paean to Spielberg's Neverneverland fixation.; Why would anyone want to love a child whose destiny is to be 
destroyed when its parent dies or becomes bored?; It's too long, by 20 minutes or more, and the story
meanders far too much to keep the viewer's interest.; It doesn't even come close.; just doesn't cut it."
664.0,Twister,1998.0,"The makers have shown us
our world in an exciting new light, which is one of the best things that can
happen at the cinema.; **** Amazing, potent stuff.; =20
And it helps that both Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, while not ""major""=20
stars, are likable and share a pleasant camaraderie.; I found it emotionally compelling not just
because of the awesome forces our heroes face but because of the sheer
delight in normality we share with the stormchasers.; Paxton is a great minor actor I have enjoyed for a long time.","The director 
could do worse than to recut this mess.; What a waste of screen time.); In short, there is nothing in this movie besides the special
effects to make the movie interesting.; It has
absolutly no character development, no plot twists (hell, it barely even
has a plot) and basically no script.; It is flimsy and instantly
forgettable."
680.0,Pulp Fiction,2000.0,"These two
characters work together perfectly, and the performances by each actor are
nearly perfect.; Eric Stoltz is great as the drug dealer--his panic, etc., is great
comedy.; But overall, this
is a brilliant, witty, violent masterpiece.; I highly recommended this film by one of today's brightest young
writers and directors.; I think
the movie is truly unique and is perfect for its genre so I give it my
top rating of ****.","Tarantino's overblown
pretentious directing style is extremely annoying, he seems to believe
the press he has been receiving, which as we all know signals the death
of talent.; Now with PULP
FICTION, another hot young director, Quentin Tarantino, has paid
tribute to some of the worst that literature has to offer.; Don't believe the hype.; The film is an
(amazingly) sometimes humorous non-stop rip-off of every 20th Century
media cliche imaginable--complete with no context, no soul, no
pacing, no proportion, and no ideas!; It seems to have been overlooked that half this
dialogue is muffled and is barely audible, and the other half is not
particularly amusing or interesting anyway."
686.0,Contact,1999.0,"Her superb performance
captures the astronomer's emotions with subtle notes.; Yes the effects are amazing, but what makes them even more
amazing is the fact that they are enclosed in an excellent film.; How refreshing.; Julia Roberts is good - very good, - and it begins wonderfully.; It was the best integration,
and the best CGI I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.","It would be a
terrible waste of space wouldn't it?; Is ""Contact"" awful?; I can't really emphasize how bad this film was.; :P Effects were bad, plot was horrible, dialouge seemed to comprise of ""Did
we get 'em!""; It is a supreme disappointment."
687.0,Dead Man Walking,1998.0,"The bond that develops between them is, 
paradoxically, both exceedingly complex and deceptively simple, and 
Robbins, with considerable help from his actors, captures it perfectly.; Sister Helen has never counselled a death 
row inmate before and her awkwardness at their first meeting is brilliantly 
conveyed by Susan Sarandon.; Release Date: March 29th 1996 (UK) I have been waiting for DEAD MAN WALKING to be released here in the UK for 
many months now, and with all the high praise the film has received in the 
US I was very pleased to finally get a chance to see this fine film this 
week.; This is very realistic
because we all know the rich and powerful are able to buy their freedom.; Kids may not be able 
to handle the lengthy death scene at the end of the movie, but DEAD 
MAN WALKING has a strong message for all ages.","With his hair
Brylcreemed back in an Elvis pompidour and his wiry facial hair, Poncelet
looks like he's some odd mixture of gigolo and back-alley dweller.; DEAD MAN WALKING could easily be manipulative or exploitative, but it's 
neither.; I defy anyone to sit unaffected through DEAD MAN WALKING.; When will filmmakers 
learn that superimposing opening credits on action and 
dialogue makes the audience miss parts of both?; Is Matthew going to be executed because he was too poor 
to hire a fat-cat lawyer (""Ain't nobody with money on death row"")?"
696.0,Manhattan,1996.0,"It's an important question,
and the fact that we care to know is what makes ""Manhattan"" one of the best
films of all time.; The Gershwin soundtrack is actually intrusive,
but the script is excellent.; A brilliant tale of a
contemporary neurotic in the romanticized world of Manhattan.; Allen's sense of humor and
romantic nature makes it almost credible that his
character would be dating Hemingway and Keaton despite
his unemployment and unromantic appearance.; It's beautiful and perfect, almost too perfect to be used in a movie
with characters so undeserving.","Looks like someone needs to rent WAITING TO EXHALE.; But it doesn't work, it can't work, not in this
world with these characters.; The last
scene would be painful to watch if it were in any other movie.; his new, inferior apartment has brown
tap water) for laughs.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
710.0,GoldenEye,1999.0,"But what makes Natalya such a radical and delightful departure
from the usual good-girl Bond-meat isn't her skilled professionalism,
or her charming geekdom, or her feisty spirit.; There is a great deal that could be Bonded if
cleverly adapted to the changing times--easily as much as before
since villainy is still all over and technology keeps leaping and
bounding, There are always new opportunities for 007 to reappear.; Anyone who is familiar with the Bond ouvre will recognize
immediately that this is a radical departure.; GOLDENEYE is one of the best Bond movies I have seen.; Quite a departure from the female fawning
and groveling that characterizes most Bond movies.","Past a point, its arbitrariness
becomes annoying.; There is just too much that is too silly about GOLDENEYE and too
many mistakes in the making.; If even the script says there is nothing
to admire about Bond, why should the audience feel any different?; In a word, disappointing.; There are some attempts at jocularity but feeble and forced ones."
714.0,Tomorrow Never Dies,1999.0,"Look for
great performances from Jonathan Pryce and Michelle Yeoh.; Despite that, I enjoyed the film, and think
it's the best Bond film since For Your Eyes Only.; All of the action is
well choreographed, and the stunts are first rate.; It is often said that the villain makes the Bond film, and TOMORROW
NEVER DIES has a great one in Carver, played so wonderfully by
Jonathan Pryce.; It very much reminds me of Bassey's
wonderful `Goldfinger'.","I'm sorry, the plot is just too ridiculous for words.; A potentially imaginative idea about having a media mogul as the
villain of the piece is completely wasted by a wafer-thin story line
involving a stealth ship (Oh pleeaase!!!!; Add the lack of originality and some silly continuity errors, plus a rather
weak performance from Pryce,and this is a disappointing Bond adventure.; After a while, it just gets tedious.; The idea that women would THROW themselves at
him just doesn't make sense."
755.0,From Dusk Till Dawn,1997.0,"Rodriguez and Tarantino are well aware that for the second half, he's 
making a ""balls-out exploitation flick"" (albeit one with a top-flight 
cast), and the honest lack of pretensions is refreshing.; Great dialog, fun action sequences, and excellent acting from a
great cast, including Tarantino, who is often taking hits on his acting
ability (sometimes justifiable hits).; Distributor: Dimension Films It's great fun, but certainly not great art.; Comments are appreciated.; Schlock horror in and of itself makes for interesting
viewing and psuedo intelligent insults.","I'll take a
pass on this one, it's just not my style of a film.; Although a 
terrible performer, he doesn't actually damage the movie, however, 
because acting ability has little merit here.; In the latter, writer-director Tarantino did even 
worse.; Unrelieved, very dull, this becomes a second, tacked-on, 
irrelevant movie.; Also 
not a good sign is Arnold carrying a film."
766.0,Army of Darkness,1998.0,"There are
great scenes.; However, I
found that I enjoyed it a lot also.; As a combination horror/comedy, this film works very
well.; This makes for some great comic moments, such as when he 
must speak the sacred words (a little tribute to ""The Day the Earth Stood 
Still"") before removing the Necronomicon from the graveyard.; What makes the 
movie so funny, so quotable, and just so memorable?","All 
the fat has been trimmed off this movie, which means no character 
development, no exposition of plot, no long scenes of dialogue, nothing by 
constant action and laughs.; * * - Pretty bad, see it at your own risk.; Because
director Sam Raimi is making a bad movie on purpose!; If this movie were one of the evil dead, it would turn
pale from not breathing.; Then there are those special effects that are
laughable, and I'm not sure if it was intended or not."
782.0,Gattaca,2000.0,"He provides several nice touches, and his final
scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one.; His mild clumsiness, shows that the
real Vincent is flawed and human, and at the same time shows a certain
grace that gives credit to the role.; Aided immeasurably by Michael Nyman's stirring score --
   to date, the best score I've heard this year -- it's a genuinely
   moving celebration of the human spirit, while avoiding the trappings
   of becoming schmaltzy or sentimental.; The geneticall perfect were well-tailored suits, the
offices are quiet, sleek temples of efficiency.; Among its arsenal of strengths (crisp, sharp visuals by
   cinematographer Slawomir Idziak; wonderful costumes by the legendary
   Colleen Atwood), GATTACA benefits from superb casting.","That's what you'll get if you waste your money on a piece of
garbage known as GATTACA.; The ""Gattaca"" employees are
bland, dull, Organization Men in identical designer suits.; However, the script suffers from a lack of impact.; The characters aren't interesting, either.; In  fact, if memory serves me right (by this
time I was bored to the point of narcolepsy) they just walked into the
spaceship wearing coats and ties without even bothering to put on
spacesuits."
784.0,Kolya,1986.0,"All in all a great movie.; Andrej Chalimon is a real treat.; KOLYA represents Miramax's 
first major foreign-language release of the new year, and, for those who 
aren't intimidated by subtitles, it offers a charming, warm-hearted 
evening of cinema.; The chemistry between him and Zdenek
Sverak is great.; The film also boasts a strong cast.","Nadezda, the bride-on-paper, is ravishing, speaks no Czech, has a 5-year
old boy called Kolya.; It would be nice to accept this film as a creative entry from Eastern
Europe, but so much of the film is predictable and taken up with
sequences that have become hackneyed that one has to start faulting the
film for this lack of originality.; Jan Sverak has made a movie that's neither kitschy nor exessively
cute.; To be interested kids should probably be
about ten or so.; It gets worse."
792.0,Platoon,1997.0,"Chris tends to maintain his sanity, for the most part,
unlike many of his fellow infantrymen, as he strives to always do what
seems morally right.; He lives in continual fear of what lies ahead.; O'Neill)
DIRECTOR: Oliver Stone
CERTIFICATION: R (USA) for violence, language, and disturbing war scenes
YEAR OF PRODUCTION: 1986
ACADEMY AWARDS: Best Picture, Best Director (Stone), Best Film Editing
(Claire Simpson)
ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS: Best Supporting Actor (Berenger), Best
Supporting Actor (Dafoe), Best Original Screenplay (Stone), Best
Cinematography (Robert Richardson) PLATOON, the first film in Oliver Stone's Vietnam War trilogy, is an
extremely gripping and powerful first-hand account of the life of a young
soldier in Vietnam.; One of the greatest films in the history of cinema and a war
film like no other.; PLATOON is absolutely one of the greatest Vietnam War films, and possibly the
greatest when it comes to the depiction of a soldier's everyday life.","There is the horrible incident where a redneck soldier, Bunny
(Dillon), who in an odd way enjoys being in Viet Nam.; Certainly people are entitled to their opinion but more important
than that, 'Platoon' forced movie audiences, politicians, military brass and
society in general to look at an ugly aspect of world history.; As in Triumph Of The Will, false
mythology is created making nonsense of reality without seeming to use
manipulation or propaganda.; It portends to be a film about the
real war in Vietnam and not someone's metaphor for the war.; Barnes's men having arrived first use the excuse of finding some weapons
to begin intimidating the villagers, killing livestock; and, Barnes,
goes so far as killing an old woman."
795.0,City of Angels,1999.0,"Highly recommended.; Very solid performances by both Cage and Ryan and, in fact, by all
in the cast, make the film  most entertaining and thought-provoking.; Ryan transcends her pixie-ish cuteness with one of her best performance
ever and Cage is perfectly cast as the confused angel.; It is Ryan that makes the
story wonderful.; Don't Miss City of Angels on the big
screen and bring a loved one to see it with you; this is definitely a date
film.","But, unfortunately, the load is too heavy, and they are
weighed down by a heavy-handed and ill-conceived storyline.; A typical film would have made the boyfriend a
drunken lout, but this guy's only bad traits are being both boring and a
smoker.; Unfortunately, she's not given much opportunity to stretch her acting
muscles -- it's as if she's spending the whole movie reacting instead of
acting.; That they all wear trenchcoats 
doesn't help their credibility.; The philosophy
becomes heavy-handed, the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep,
and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the
audience's hankie."
796.0,Cruel Intentions,1994.0,"Her performance is perfectly natural, believable,
and affecting.; This is a calculated guilty pleasure and, on 
those terms, I enjoyed it.; A superb, simple, and entertaining script combined with a
surprisingly impressive cast has made ""Cruel Intentions"" one of the most
exceptional movies I've seen in years.; The real surprise in this film is the outstanding Selma Blair
as a little girl discovering sex, her performance is very well performed,
and all of her scenes work.; He is a lot of fun to watch.","Even the ""intellectuals"" I know don't bother with this kind
of pointless and pretentious yammering.; Because it's a really lousy idea, that's why, made even worse by
appalling execution.; The script and direction by Roger Kumble is mediocre at best.; True, he
is bad, but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with.; It is sad, however, that these filmmakers have to keep picking
promising source material for their libretti, then demonstrating no
concern for that material whatsoever."
812.0,Aladdin,2001.0,"Wacky, fun, and great animation are what Aladdin is all
about, so this Disney classic gets *** 1/2 stars.; The ending is a bit abrupt, but I still think that
this is a great film for your entire family to watch again and again.; It's the
same way here; the best song of the movie is ""You've Never Had A Friend
Like Me,"" sung by the Genie as he dazzles us (and makes us laugh) with a
phantasmagoria of shapes, sizes, impressions and gags galore.; A terrific
must see--10 points out of 10.; Aladdin was another warped Disney fairytale that
has been brought to life with great songs, flashy animation and effects, and
lots of funny characters and gags.","But skip all that good/bad crap.; Why is the
sultan so dumb?); Nothing much, except his
performance is the core of the film, the only real reason to see it (and
resee it).; In a movie filled with Academy Award winning
music (Alan Menken) but mediocre songs (Alan Menken, Howard Ashman, Tim
Rice), a couple of the most forgettable songs occur in the beginning.; (WEST SIDE STORY is a notable example of this - singing and
dancing 1950s street gangs look absolutely ridiculous when viewed from a
1990s perspective.)"
813.0,Airplane!,1998.0,"After all, it's brought to us by one of the best known satire
writing/directing teams.; He's a dry, subtle,
sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest
lines of the film.; is really a top-notch spoof that will likely forever be
known as a spoof classic.; The most fun
character by far is the doctor, played by Leslie Nielsen.; is the story of Ted Striker (Robert Hays) - an ex-fighter-pilot who
has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of
war led to the death of six, er, seven comrades.","This character
is pointless, nauseating, and very unfunny.; it
had to do with bad fish.; Someone gets sick.; In a film like this, you're not really expecting an elaborate production, so
one can't complain about the amateurish quality.; You gotta give
it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long."
817.0,Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,1999.0,"Still, while imperfect, The Spy Who Shagged Me is a lot of fun.; This character is one the
funniest parts of the film and I enjoyed it.; This works surprisingly well.; This is a testament to Williams' genius because he is subtle, yet powerful.; It's all in fun, and the overall
product is very shagadelic.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; Instead, I had to sit through 95 minutes of good jokes stuck in a very,
very bad movie.; Evil, who combines the worst features of Ernst Blofeld and Ed Sullivan.; * * - Pretty bad.; Even that
defect could be compensated for if the humor were not so
sophomoric, repetitive, just plain unfunny."
820.0,JFK,1998.0,"Overall it is an enjoyable film.; Stone's perfect depiction of mood is what
makes it all realistic and the excellent acting clinches it.; It grasps you, moves you, and makes you think.; JFK
makes us feel used, abused and powerless.; What is so wonderful about JFK is that it puts that intense scrutiny on
the government, Warren's report and autopsy/police records.","The prologue does not really have much of a plot any more than ALL THE
PRESIDENT'S MEN did.; There are quite a few notables in the
cast, perhaps to make a political point.; In the February 1992 Vanity Fair, no less than Norman Mailer wrote
that despite director Oliver Stone's clumsiness with facts, ""The first
thing to be said about JFK is that it is a great movie, and the next is
that it is one of the worst great movies ever made.""; Any intellectual interest outside of careerism puts
one at risk for association with this outgroup.; Yes, you *will* be entertained by this movie unless you are
braindead."
825.0,Playing by Heart,1999.0,"Connery plays a role closer to his
own age for a change and gives a gruff but surprisingly touching and
comic performance.; The most effective storylines are buoyed by terrific performances and/or
chemistry: the appealing Anderson and Stewart work surprisingly well
together in the Meredith/Trent strand, and the luminous Jolie compensates
for Phillippe's adequate but fairly colorless work in the Joan/Keenan
story.; All in all, this movie offers many interesting characters, talking and
living genuine and engaging love lives, wonderful performances by its solid
cast, too sweet of an ending, but an enjoyable and rewatchable movie
nonetheless.; CRITIQUE:
Charmingly effective romantic drama, this film offers insight into various
types of relationships, presents us with interesting characters and
excellent performances from the cast, and scratches beneath the surface of
love and its many complex subtleties.; Jolie is
actually very good as the peppy Joan (she was honored by the National
Society of Film Critics for this role) and Phillippe shows some actual
depth and range after his summer debacle 54 (which I thought may have
been his I.Q.","Every move of Playing By Heart seems carefully calculated, and when it
tries to surprise the audience, the effort just falls flat.; It might be confusing if I said that what could have made this story more
interesting is where the movie failed.; Padding out the film (not that it needed any padding) are an adulterous 
couple played by Madeleine Stowe and ""E.R.; Throughout the whole film, there's nary a poor performance to
be seen.; It's a shame to see how often an assembly of great actors go
to waste."
841.0,Dune,1999.0,"Than
there was music by pop group Toto, whose ambientalist sound,
together with new age theme by Brian Eno, made the
soundtrack very different from conventional themes by John
Williams or Jerry Goldsmith.; And the magnificent score by Toto and Brian
Eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty
years.; Francesca Annis also left strong impact as Paul's
mother Jessica, with her stunning combination of mature
sexuality and commanding presence.; The planet is also rich with spice
melange, substance essential for the interstellar travel,
and of extreme importance for the powerful Guild of Space
Navigators.; *For background information a special thankyou to hiphats@aol.com.","The most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a
hopelessly jumpy narrative, leaving us with badly underdeveloped
characters.; But the most notable omission is a
gratuitous piece of nonsense from Lynch that wasn't even in Herbert's
book.; Unfortunately, I
can't sing the same praises for Lynch's screenplay.; And, even if
some brave producer and director would somehow acquire such
great sums of money, they would be faced with another
problem.; The hundreds and hundreds of pages of text, full of
detailed and elaborated scenes, numerous sub-plots and
interesting characters were, to say the least, very unlikely
to be squeezed into the regular feature film format."
853.0,Enemy at the Gates,2000.0,"This
question is unanswered in Jean-Jacques Arnaud's strikingly
photographed story of the Battle of Stalingrad, involving
combat that would change the course of the war and lead to
the ultimate victory of the Soviet Union over Germany--in
much the way the Battle of Saratoga was the turning point of
our own War for Independence.; These action sequences, especially the battle itself, is stunning in its
depiction of the savagery of war.; A grand
movie filled with suspense, impressive visuals and an absorbing story line!; That's not to say that this is a good film.; Here's a great looking man, admired widely by both sexes, oozing more of his
on-screen persona in this film and then upping the ante with a solid showing
as the sniper who may not be the person that everyone believes him to be.","While the film is technically about snipers, there are far too many predictable
sniping scenes.; It's
quite mediocre and frequently dull.; A trimmed up script would start with the entire 
elimination of Tania, an unneeded diversion.; Witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere.; The rest of the cast doesn't make such an
effort so we get an odd mix of mostly British accents from the rest."
856.0,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,1998.0,"Aside from the
fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies (it's the first film to
combine real actors and cartoon characters, have them interact, and make it
convincingly real) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective
comedy/mystery.; But fortunately, Ken
Ralston, of Star Wars and Forrest Gump fame, has done a splendid job in
meshing the two worlds together.; I finally got around to seeing this after reading some negative reviews
and was pleasantly surprised.; One that not only presented a great
challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family
(although some very young viewers may be a little scared by Judge Doom).; I give this a must-see, A-,
     +3, and a 95%.","Do not, I repeat -- do *not* -- show up late for this film.; In nearly every
shot they go out of their way to show off.; They only have to act in front of the camera with no
cues or references.; Perhaps they wanted it released
through their adult division because of some violence, though their
professed reason was that Jessica Rabbit was a little too well-endowed and a
little under-dressed for a child audience.; (I could tell you more
about characters which get applause for just showing up, but I'm bound and
determined not to put any spoilers in this review.)"
858.0,Sleepless in Seattle,1993.0,"While the plot is sentimental and a little sticky, the dialogue is a
lot of fun and often very witty and insightful.; While this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, especially amidst the
burgeoning tide of action/adventure summer fare, it is not without
flaws.; The story is mature without losing its essential
magic, in that two people from opposite sides of America can find each
other through a radio show.; Subtle humor abounds, but it's the
kind that normal people encounter in everyday life, more often worthy
of a chuckle than outright laughter.; SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE is beautifully shot, as well.","But none of
them can save the film from being a bore.; The dinner scene with them near the
beginning of the movie is pointless, with the attempts at humor coming
across as weak and unfunny.; Its characters are dull and
empty, its script isn't funny or particularly charming.; But it's a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly
as Nora Ephron botched Sleepless in Seattle, a hollow, boring romance
that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers; the ones
willing to buy into Ephron's whiny views of life and romance.; It's not that this part of the movie is unpleasant, but it doesn't seem
to belong, and the cutting-room floor might have been a more
appropriate place for it to reside."
861.0,Total Recall,1995.0,"Verhoeven did great job not only in directing very good and
memorable action scenes, and neatly tying them with
thought-provoking and intelligent plot.; All in all, TOTAL RECALL is well paced,
entertaining and thought-provoking piece of science fiction
cinema, a truly superb, yet disregarded gem of that
particular genre.; I've always loved movies that make you think about what's going
on.; In fact, it's very good.; Even when it does
diverge, some of the concepts it adds are thoughtful and intelligent.","One disappointing aspect, though, are the special effects.; Stone, of course, is useless, making a
pretty poor wife, and a pretty poor action hero.; Whirling around in fake Oriental moves only looks ridiculous.; Sitcom antics involving various goofball aliens in a bar give way
to endless shoot-outs.; Some of the model heads look appaling fake, and Quatto
is a major disappointment."
863.0,Toy Story 2,1997.0,"What a sweet, wonderful, powerful film.; This is one of the best movies of the
year, is beautifully animated, and (Gasp!); ""Toy Story 2"" is a great amount
of fun for all ages.; Marvelously voiced by Joan Cusack, 
Jessie is one of the most well-written and realistically portrayed modern 
animated characters in some time.; Superb.","Instead we
must suffer with 2 minutes of Sarah Maclachlan trying to sing.; 1999 - 90 minutes
Rated G (nothing objectionable).; However, one voice-over also stands
out as horribly miscast.; To
the children, it just looks like a silly scene.; Far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little."
864.0,Cool Runnings,1999.0,"The
bobsled footage is superb, and the Olympic village atmosphere is
exciting.; COOL
RUNNINGS carries on a tradition of formula comedies exuding
good-natured energy, and entertaining more than they have any right
to.; It also describes COOL
RUNNINGS and, while this motion picture is far from a landmark, few
could complain about Candy's performance.; That's a rarity, and it's worth praise on its
own level.; After having his chances of qualifying for Jamaica's 1988 Olympic
track team dashed because of a freak accident, Derice Bannock (Leon)
goes in search of another sport to put him in the world's spotlight.","What could have given a fresh look at an
unusual sport proves instead to be a forgettable movie-going
experience.; Except this film tries to fictionalize
the truth, changing the story into one of mediocrity with no twists or
surprises worth mentioning.; In the past, Candy's name in the
credits has been almost as sure a sign of a comedy I'll hate as Mickey
Rourke's has been of a drama I'll hate.; Director:  Jon Turtletaub.; COOL RUNNINGS
is marginally successful in all of these areas."
869.0,Planet of the Apes,1998.0,"The performances throughout are top-notch.; This hesitation is what makes
his character believable and vulnerable.; But he delivers
them very well.; What makes the film better than average is the
risks taken by Burton, especially with that heady ending.; The realism of these apes is incredible as advanced
make-up techniques give these creatures an uncannily
human look.","Even Chuck Heston's anti-gun tirade (in the de rigeur cameo)
seems shallow and jokey.; Director Tim 
Burton's unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly,
pointless remake.; Synopsis: In the near future, astronaut Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) is lost in 
an electrical storm in space, and crash lands on a planet where apes are 
the dominant lifeform.; Sadly, I sat down to watch Burton's version
of Planet of the Apes and within the first 20 minutes, I was checking my
watch and my girlfriend (a big fan of the original film) started to nod
off.; Had as much work been done in giving 
the people a little more personality as was spent on the Oscar-bound makeup, 
there might have been a little more material to chew on."
871.0,Planet of the Apes,1957.0,"Like astronaut Leo Davidson (Wahlberg), the film hits the ground
running, whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid
one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust
that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come
later.; It also gives us another chance to
experience the skewed vision of Tim Burton and that's nothing to
complain about.; Music by Danny Elfman.; As a man
who just wants out, Wahlberg is focused, subtle and sly.; This is a Tim Burton movie, boys and girls.","For
the original ending to work, we only had to make one simple connection,
for this one, we have to write a whole new screenplay.; As
for lack of color, remember, Leo only launches into space to get his
monkey back.; But viewers had to suffer through
numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages
delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball.; and lack of interest in standard issue heroes.; Tim Burton movies have great
art direction and thin, clunky stories."
884.0,Crash,1977.0,"The ensemble cast is excellent , Spader, whose expresionless face is
letter-perfect for the character and adds to the gloomy tone , but Elias
Koteas is deliciously malignant as the morbid Vaughan .; The music by Howard Shore is one of the best things about the film.; Powerful
performances by all the leads (especially Holly Hunter and Elias Koteas
as big-time fetishists), excellent scoring, and masterful visuals make
CRASH a tricky little picture.; It's an 
astounding piece of work, in more ways than one, and, like it or not, 
probably Cronenberg's best.; The strength of CRASH was the effective portrayal of the dark and forbidding 
world the characters inhabit.","His 
character is poorly developed to begin with; Spader does nothing to 
invest Ballard with any additional life.; They rarely even act like people; it's as if they are all 
various aspects of one terribly sad personality.; The movie tries to milk these 
themes for one-hundred minutes, but basically runs out of interesting 
material in less than a third of that time.; To put it as succinctly as possible, ""Crash"" is 
pretentious crap.; As for the plot, ""Crash"" barely has one."
922.0,Dead Man,1988.0,"Aside from Jarmusch's
deadpan humor, the dreamlike intonations, the psychedelics, and the
surreal camerawork (a beautifully shot black-and-white film by Robby
Müller slowly unfolding, that catches hold of the deathlike odyssey
sequences and the superb imagery of the landscape), but also relates a
strong history lesson and a colorful mystical tour of the death
experience that adds an especially vibrant visionary sense to this
stunning and problematical film.; To me the ending is perfect, and it provides a beautiful
symmetry to the beginning.; All of this makes Dead Man  an enjoyable viewing experience as a
quirky, off-beat take on the Old West.; It's filled with irony and 
subtle humor, but contains a serious message about the fragility and 
uncertainty of human existence.; He shows his job offer to the train's ethereal fireman
(Crispin Glover).","Not to be confused with DEAD MAN WALKING, this tedious, episodic
anti-western stars a bespectacled Johnny Depp as William Blake, a timid
accountant from Cleveland whose first day in the muddy frontier town of
Machine is a busy one.; In this pyschedelic Western film, Blake and Nobody are almost complete
opposites, contraries if you will, borrowing from one of the bard's
adages of how best to gain wisdom.; The first half of the film was
quite dialogue heavy.; The second half wasn't as colorful and the
conversations were scarce, mainly due to the lack of characters.; But if that is the case, the film offers few
clues as to what exactly the events in the rest of the film are meant to
symbolize."
926.0,Galaxy Quest,1992.0,"Still, a good solid fun time.; This is a must see for Trekkies.; ""Galaxy Quest"" is an enjoyable movie.; Galaxy Quest succeeds as a funny parody of Star Trek and while it's not
a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it
is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all
the sober Oscar contenders being released this holiday season.; The movie not only
perfectly satirizes ""Star Trek"" episodes and characters, but it also portrays
fanatics with perfect accuracy.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; I
don't even think Trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof, because quite
frankly it's just not funny.; * * - Pretty bad.; The WORST thing they could have done is to make a joke of the TV show's
actors (the movie's characters).; The second-worst thing the filmmakers could have done is to make a joke
of the movie's TV show, which they did."
928.0,Gremlins 2: The New Batch,2001.0,"And to be honest, some of the movie's satire is
surprisingly amusing.; Yes, it's true, the
performances by the special effects are generally better than the
performances by the actors, and the film has more rubber logic than
most, but it's FUN!; There
are more sight-gags, parodies and wonderful bits throughout this movie.; The puppetry and radio-controlled gremlins in this movie were both
extremely well-done.; There's an on-target
parody of Kate's ""Why I Hate Christmas"" speech (though it was a tad too
long) from the first movie, and great satire of corporate personality
throughout the film.","Galligan is adequate in the lead
role, but Cates proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that her acting lessons
were a terrible waste of time and money.; It is supposed to be funny,
not make sense.; However, because I am still hung up on films having plots and this
one is a pretty mediocre plot, I can give this film no better than a
high zero on the -4 to +4 scale.; The film tries to fashion itself as an AIRPLANE-style,
no-holds-barred parody.; About every five or ten minutes, GREMLINS 2 comes up with a clever gag, but
in between you have to suffer through some awfully chaotic and deadly dull
sequences, as the gruesome gremlins belch, bang, and brawl their way
through the movie."
929.0,Godzilla,1998.0,"I really
enjoyed this thrill ride of a film.; Often very fun.; He orchestrates some well-timed send-ups of
the ""American way of life"" with hilarious results; he's a strong actor
who gives an equally strong performance.; Matthew Broderick is
surprisingly strong as well.; ""Terrific!!""","This is a complete disappointment.; The film painfully lacks logic.; The script
is one of the worst of all big budget flicks, filled with terrible
dialogue, and some really awful plotting.; Dumb writing and thin
characters hurt it, but this movie isn't supposed to be art, it's only
supposed to be fun.; They were so bad, I was actually BORED."
941.0,Lethal Weapon,1998.0,"But the
spectacle comes second to the well-created atmosphere of the
film and Donner's clever use of sharp contrasts - Murtaugh's
suburban idyll vs. Riggs' living in cheap trailer, glamorous
lifestyle vs. corruption and depravity.; Credit is also due to Gary Busey
who turns in a fine performance as a psychopathic Vietnam vet (he's good at
playing crazies) and to Tom Atkins as Glover's old war buddy whose daughter
stars in one of the most stimulating opening scenes I have ever seen.; In short, this film is a must see for anyone at all interested in the
present rage of killer-cop and angry soldier movies this Spring (and also for
those who aren't interested but like action).; This director never belonged to the major
league of Hollywood filmmakers, but his reputation of
reliable craftsman is well deserved, since he always
succeeds in turning his mega-budgets into pleasant viewing
experiences.; The action scenes are, on
the whole, extremely well executed; I was on the edge of my seat for most of
the movie.","To make thing even
worse, bad quality of sequels even managed to change the
initial good impressions of originals.; And nothing, absolutely nothing, could justify the
anti-climatic fight scene between Gibson and Gary Busey, the albino-crazed
henchman.; Ridiculous plot element
is heaped on to ridiculous plot element: the two cops are invited up to a
Beverly Hills home of one of the key figures in the drug organization, where an
assassination attempt is made; the police aren't going to make the connection
if their two detectives disappear during their visit?; Eastwood's too old, Bronson was never any good to
begin with, Stallone too lifeless, Norris too stupid, and Harrison Ford looks
too much like John Fogerty :-).; But
that chemistry is erratic at best, and doesn't come close to saving the film."
943.0,Lethal Weapon 3,1992.0,"This is one of those films that will be
most spectacular on the big screen, so if you have a chance to see it
in the theater, it is worth it.; First off, it is refreshing to see the two actors, Mel Gibson and
Danny Glover, back at work in my favorite roles of theirs.; This is a classic scene.; The Mel
Gibson and Danny Glover combination works out great.; On that note, the LW movies get the following ratings: These series are evolving into the American Bond movies, (IMHO).","Storywise, there was absolutely no reason for him
      to be in the film.; A *funny* mess, to be sure, but still a mess.; This would have seriously crippled the film.; It was just about everything a bad sequel usually
is.; To put
      him in the third film seemed to be nothing but repetition of a
      successful ingredient in place of doing something else more
      innovative."
948.0,Halloween,1992.0,"I highly recommend it.; It had me frightened the first time I saw it years and
years ago, and it's still effective today.; The movie is flawless if not perfect.; I have probably seen John Carpenter's horror masterpiece, ""Halloween,"" more 
times than any other film (the first time being when I was all of 
4-years-old), and it will always be the best horror film ever made, in my 
eyes.; It's a classic, and it deserves to be, it's damn
fun.","It's never made
quite clear (although sequels would offer a few lame motives).; serial killers,
women-in-danger, or sex) will probably be offended by this movie as well.; It's hard to believe that the actress would develop 
(in more ways than one) into a woman whose sexual appeal would drive 
pictures like A FISH CALLED WANDA.; Myers dispatches his victims rather violently,
granted, but director Carpenter chooses not to linger upon the gore.; 1978 - 93 minutes
Rated R (for violence, sexual situations, brief nudity, and profanity)."
949.0,Heat,2000.0,"This aside, strong performances by the principals and some excellent
bit parts by players like Hank Azaria, Tom Noonan, Natalie Portman, and
Jon Voight make HEAT a truly memorable film.; It's a brilliantly
hatched and well executed plan.; De Niro delivers a strong but controlled
performance as do Kilmer and Voight.; The cinematography is excellent, ceaslessy portraying a sharp,
blue, cold world, where the surfaces repel all dust.; But Hanna is also good.","Ridiculous.; The first problem is that all
the character-building information is cliched and uninteresting.; It's a ridiculous cliche.; The rest varies from
humdrum to tedious.; Pointless, has nothing to do with anything."
954.0,Mission: Impossible,1994.0,"When Cruise and his pals are performing missions, it's a 
tight suspenseful film, very well-done.; The juxtaposition of the converstation against what we see Cruise thinking
is a brilliant, and effective, device.; This sequence brings the best suspense
moments in the movie.; Comments are appreciated.; Mission Impossible is a good movie that has been taking a lot of critical
hits from people who seem to have been expecting DIE HARD IV meets
GOLDENEYE.","That 
would be a waste of breath.; What the hell are we supposed to make of a surveillance
expert (Emilio Estevez) watching a black-and-white video of what appears
to be a bad Russian soap opera?; Either the plot-web was too
tangled or I'm just not very good at figuring these things out.; And just a little 
exploration might have added some weight or substance to the story that 
would make it more than just a twisty little nothing of a film.; The only two action scenes (out of five) of any interest are 
ones that seem like they were outtakes from other movies."
955.0,Mission: Impossible II,1998.0,"Mission: Impossible
was an incredible TV show that incorporated unique story lines, amazing
character interactions, and some great villains.; Her character
contains a certain amount of power that you would
never find a female character hold in, say, a James
Bond movie and change like this is great to see.; See it and have fun!; ""Mission: Impossible II"" is not quite the equal of its predecessor -- Brian 
De Palma's 1996 adaptation of the hit TV show was a modern classic in action 
cinema -- but it is an effective spectacle of violence.; A brilliant cutting of 
this sequence makes the sequence superb.","Unfortunately, that potential gets lost in the movie's second half, in 
which Newton has far less screen time.; Nothing seems original at
all.; Aside from a playful car chase, not much happens for far too
many minutes.; M:I-2 is an utter disappointment and a delusion of a film.; Even Woo cannot save the 
tedious and overlong middle third of the movie."
968.0,Dog Day Afternoon,1997.0,"DOG DAY AFTERNOON is, overall, a rather enjoyable movie.; RATING: *** out of **** - 7.5 out of 10.0
CAST: Al Pacino (Sonny), John Cazale (Sal), Charles Durning (Moretti),
Chris Sarandon (Leon)
DIRECTOR: Sidney Lumet
CERTIFICATION: R (USA) for language and violence 
YEAR OF PRODUCTION: 1975
ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS: Best Picture, Best Actor (Pacino), Best
Supporting Actor (Sarandon)
ACADEMY AWARDS: Original Screenplay (Frank Pierson) Based on a true story, DOG DAY AFTERNOON is the story of two Brooklyn men,
Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and Sal (John Cazale), who attempt to rob a bank
in a desperate attempt for funds.; Sonny is a former bank employee who knows all the tricks of the trade,
which he shows by being, for the most part, well aware of the surroundings.; This is a delightfully understated comment on the media, and 
certainly more effective than some contemporary films (NATURAL BORN 
KILLERS leaps to mind).; It is agreeable that it could have been better in
many ways, but it is one of the more famous bank heist films of the past
few decades.","Sal was pretty
uninteresting.; The dialogue is 
ho-hum, the plot is simple and uninteresting (I really didn't even care 
if the robbers made a getaway or not), and the characters are dry and 
underacted.; The only thing that I found funny about the film was the 
robbers' complete cluelessness about the art of bank robbery, but that 
idea was basically thrown away in favor of unclear drama.; This lack of direction 
is magnified by the larger plot of the film: the film starts out funny 
but ends dead serious.; He mostly shouted into a bullhorn throughout
the whole film."
1018.0,Mulholland Drive,1991.0,"Angelo Badalamenti's score is typically strong and simultaneously
eerie, while cinematographer Peter Deming, who also does a great job on the
upcoming From Hell, makes everything shadowy and claustrophobic.; She's a powerful, strong woman.; It's very crafty of you!; He's got one of the funniest
senses of humor I've ever experienced in a man.; It's not just about the gray somewhere in between, but we can experience
those two extreme emotions in one person.","But again, I have to harp on this: Far, far too much of the film
(clocking in at almost 2 1/2 hours long) is nonsense.; I thought when I first read the script,
""Oh my God, it's so one-dimensional -- she should be on the side of a
cereal box in 1952!""; MULHOLLAND DRIVE runs way too long at 2:26.; Watch for an uncreditted cameo by Lee 
Grant as Lorraine.; Rated R.  Running time: 146 minutes."
1024.0,Heavenly Creatures,1968.0,"This works very well.; They are both perfectly cast and give
tremendously affecting and realistic performances.; It is an incredible
film.; HEAVENLY CREATURES is a fascinating psychological study that leaves
the viewer with a great deal to think about.; But that's
what he's done here--and it's absolutely brilliant, one of the finest
films of 1994.","This was an abysmal failure for which I
would have given it no stars at all.; I guess he
decided that would not sell enough tickets.; If it were not true, HEAVENLY CREATURES would probably be
considered too unbelievable to be a movie.; The narration is used sparingly enough
that it never seems like a crutch being used to avoid more natural
character development.; I give HEAVENLY
CREATURES ** and do not recommend it."
1049.0,Sommersby,1999.0,"THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE was the first movie
I saw with Gerard Depardieu, and it is well worth seeing.; And
despite expectations, the end is actually quite uplifting, thanks in no
small part to the strength of Gere's acting in portraying the noble
nature of a liar and cheat grappling with honesty and love for the
first time.; What we get is a wonderful interaction between Gere and Foster, an
involving plot, and a perfectly executed ending.; Composer Danny
Elfman, best known for his BATMAN score, delivers something
refreshingly different for this film.; The final court case, where the questions of loyalty,
love, betrayal and identity are exposed, is powerfully moving.","It will be
interesting to see how audiences react to this sort of picture, and
whether the names of Gere and Foster have enough box-office draw to
bring out enough of an audience to trigger what will invariably be a
positive word-of-mouth.; Would he pretend not to be in order to
get off?; Or is he
just trying a confidence scheme?; Do you just reproduce the original or
do you vary things?; Should
he be proved to *not* be Sommersby he would get off, otherwise he will
hang."
1252.0,Lonely Hearts,2001.0,"""Lonely Hearts"" won the Best Film award
from the Australian Film Institute.; The wry script deftly nails some of the
difficulties associated with romantic
relationships, especially the unrealistic
expectations that can come with them.; An Australian production,
it is refreshing in its unpredictability,
its indifference to marketing demographics,
and in the depth and credibility of its
lead characters.; ""Lonely Hearts"" is an engaging romantic
comedy, gentle and ironic in its writing
and direction.; It
was also nominated for Best Actor (Kaye),
Best Actress (Hughes), Best Direction
(Paul Cox), and Best Screenplay (Cox and
John Clarke).","There is a blunt, despairing
play director (Jon Finlayson) who seems
to live for his amateur productions.; Patricia's father (Vic Gordon) seems
intent on keeping his daughter emotionally
dependent and without relationships.; He joins a dating service
and is assigned Patricia (Wendy Hughes),
a thirtyish woman who is inhibited and
frigid, perhaps due to her controlling
and demanding parents.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
1281.0,Bean,1999.0,"What makes the show so good is the fact this simple concept makes for some of
the funniest comedy without becoming too lowbrow.; In one sense, I'm being a bit more harsh than BEAN deserves, because
it's still more entertaining than most Hollywood comedies.; Rowan Atkinson is perfect as Mr. Bean.; There are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one.; Launched from a simple situation into wild flights of humor,
Bean's actions _are_ the plot of a ""Mr. Bean"" episode.","The main problem
though is that it's just not funny.; As bad as that
sounds, it's even worse.; These
might sound funny on paper, but what actually shows up on the screen seems
pretty lame.; The dull and relatively ugly
cinematography by Francis Kenny does not help break the film's tedium.; But to be on the safe side I am
opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie."
1359.0,American Psycho,1997.0,"This is a film that makes a sharp, strong, but surprisingly simple
statement.; ""American Psycho"" is often fun and at times, surprisingly funny and on-target.; It was a surprisingly 
poignant notion by Ellis, subtle, yet effective.; Christian Bale is perfect, PERFECT as Patrick Bateman.; What it does maintain, and even enhance, is the atmosphere of dread that
always lingered beneath the surface.","The novel notwithstanding, ""American Psycho,"" the film, has nothing 
insightful to say about anything, not even the aforementioned subjects it 
attempts to satirize, while the dialogue comes off feeling stilted and 
annoying ""written.""; * * - Pretty bad, see it only if you have nothing better to do.; The only reason to shoot American Psycho is to say you
did, not to start a franchise or mount a star vehicle.; Thank god Leonardo DiCaprio did not
take the title role, he would have been terrible
miscast.; It felt like director/co-writer Mary Harron
left every other supporting character underdeveloped."
1408.0,Cutthroat Island,1999.0,"The ultimate good vs.  evil clash at
the end of the movie lasts a good 25 minutes, and it is exceptionally
spectacular.; Sound editing is excellent and the score (written by John Debney and 
performed by the London Symphony Orchestra) is suitably rousing.; I'm not going to try to tell you that this is great cinema.; This is a
pure swashbuckling action picture.; It's no
""Citizen Kane"", but in the end, ""Cutthroat Island"" delivered everything
I wanted but never got from ""Goldeneye"".","Hoping for more than a bunch 
of loud bangs and ridiculous dialogue will rob CUTTHROAT ISLAND of its 
amusement value.; I mean, why have a boring establishing shot when you have
a good helicopter camera rig close at hand?; However, while the special effects 
and explosions here far outstrip Hollywood's early pirate movies, 
storyline, characterization, and acting are vastly inferior.; I thought
that if that incomprehensibly dull Bond film had had one or two gags
that good, it would not have been such a disappointment.; Modine has absolutely no 
chemistry with co-star Davis, and watching these two together is about 
as exciting as sitting through those dumb slideshow commercials that 
precede movies in many theaters."
1412.0,"Sex, Lies, and Videotape",1997.0,"It's definitely one of the most
important films, and one of the best executed films I've seen, but it's
not a film that has a ton of depth to it.; Alas, this film is brilliant, but is probably not one of the greatest
films of all time like it may seem.; Spader's one of the more underrated actors
around, but shows us here that he is a fantastic actor.; It unfolds like a wonderfully-written novel,
introducing us to characters one-by-one, then tying them together
brilliantly.; Each
character is mysterious, but soon shows they are human and unique.","The plot is
moved only by characterization, not some cheap plot device.; In fact, for better or worse the film is very likely to spawn a fad
for amateur Kenseys all across the country to go out interviewing people about
their sex lives.; The use of
videotaping sexual confessions is not a cheap plot gimmick, but rather
an outlet that is created by one of the characters to compensate for a
lack of interest in sex.; Complicating matters even worse is Graham (James 
Spader, who won Best Actor at Cannes), John's old college buddy, who 
comes to stay at their house.; That is the set-up for the last hour of the picture, and since the film 
is entitled, ""sex, lies, and videotape,"" it is best to keep the rest of 
the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine 
surprise."
1413.0,M. Butterfly,1999.0,"Yet, despite all the problems, M. BUTTERFLY remains strangely compelling 
through most of the first hour, and a great deal of the credit for this 
must go to actor John Lone, who does an excellent job in a challenging 
role.; It's an interesting theme well-explored.; It's a good film that could have
been a very good one.; It therefore comes as a
pleasant surprise that Cronenberg's M. BUTTERFLY maintains a real
faithfulness to the basic themes of David Henry Hwang's Tony
Award-winning play, although it loses a great deal from the absence of
the stage version's Brechtian devices.; ""Everything I do has
implications,"" Song whispers.","There's no real sense that he's got a
passion for this woman; he looks like he's acting, even as an actor.; David Cronenberg is capable of making a bad movie, but never quite capable
of making a boring one.; The final scene is artsy, symbolic, pretentious, and empty.; But... Well, if the movie's intention is to show how deeply Rene's self-delusion
runs, it doesn't quite manage it.; Rarely have 
I been more disgusted by a supposedly-intelligent film's choice of 
""resolutions""."
1479.0,"Clean, Shaven",1999.0,"(One psychiatrist at the screening I attended
described this as ""the best portrayal of untreated schizophrenia ever
[presented] on film.""); What makes Greene's performance so compelling is the
fear and desperation that bleed into his every gesture,
each twitch, each blink of a wide, terrified eye.; Whether scrubbing his skin with steel wool, cutting into his scalp with a
scissor, curled into a ball fighting against a flashback, or hiding from
his own reflection, Greene has a perfect sense of Peter.; Because while it is, on the one hand, a
fascinating and utterly horrifying trip into the mind of a
schizophrenic man, it's also a story about loneliness,
isolation, and the vast spaces that lie between ordinary
people.; CLEAN, SHAVEN is one of those rare movies that
leaves an indelible imprint on anyone still watching as the closing
credits roll.","One scene in particular resulted in more than half the audience
wincing, turning away, or leaving.; And, frankly, without the controversial
scene, the character study would be incomplete.; As a result of
this single, thirty second sequence, which film maker Lodge Kerrigan
refused to edit out, this movie took nearly eighteen months to acquire a
distributor.; There are those--even among the
art-film crowd--who will find this picture unbearable.; We follow Peter as he is released (or escapes) from a hospital
and steals an ancient, decrepit car."
1492.0,1492: Conquest of Paradise,1996.0,"Here's the unexpected: 1492 is Scott's most beautiful film to date.; Bringing that painting to life is Gerard Depardieu, who took the
Best Actor prize at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival for CYRANO DE
BERGERAC.; I was completely blown away by
the sets, the costumes, the ships; I thought Depardieu was super; the
plot was really captivating; there were some wonderfully powerful
moments, i.e., when he first sights land, etc., etc.; If Depardieu doesn't present a definitive Columbus--how could
anyone even try?--1492 does present a man who fits Columbus' 
description--all the descriptions.; He makes us feel as if we know Columbus without
making us choose which Columbus to know.","I can't remember) was
just a ""bad guy.""; To summarize:  This movie tries really hard but just piddles to a
halt.; It was as if they'd made a
reasonably slow-paced movie that was three and a half hours long, and
then realized, ""We can't do this!""; :-) There was no real character development of any of the characters
besides Columbus, either.; Or was Columbus the vicious technocrat, who chanced upon Eden in
the 15th Century, bled it dry and razed it to the ground?"
1493.0,Miss Congeniality,1997.0,"With 
a lot of misadventures and plenty of laughs in between, ""Miss Congeniality"" 
pulls itself off with its cleverly written dialogue and great performance by 
Sandra Bullock.; The characters are well written out, and the supporting cast Benjamin Bratt 
as Gracie's love interest Eric Matthews, Michael Caine as the flamboyant 
Victor Melling, William Shatner in a great and funny role as Stan Fields, and 
Candice Bergen in full force as Kathy Morningside, along the great Sandra 
Bullock this is definitely a great cast.; At
heart, it's the interplay between Bullock and Caine, cute teasing from
Bullock and Bratt, and catty, but fun overall, flow between all of
Gracie's fellow pageant entrants, that made this flick surprisingly
good.; It's got a lot of easy laughs and
plenty of well-intentioned hilarity all around.; But contrary to the views of some of my fellow critics, Bullock didn't
have to carry this flick alone; she was ably assisted by the almost
always-brilliant Michael Caine as disgruntled diva-maker Victor Melling,
flat out hilarious in yet another good role.","The
""villain"" in this movie is so ridiculous, that you just want to slap the
screenwriters silly for having watched too many Saturday morning cartoons.; Nothing ever happens with the character
or his dilemma in a poor piece of story crafting.; Nothing ever happens with the character
or his dilemma in a poor piece of story crafting.; The rest of the cast is shrill or bland.; Strangely enough, William Shatner's campy pageant queen, Stan Fields,
did nothing for me; I went in expecting Shatner to chew up scenery in
classic Captain Kirk With-A-Twist mode, but he just fell flat."
1499.0,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III,1973.0,"Marketing plays a big part in
this, enticing boys and girls to go out and see the newest adventures
of their favorite foursome.; Using the same talisman that transported April, the reptilian brothers
cross through time and space to end up in the middle of the battle
between the warlord and the rebels.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Death doesn't seem to be a strong reality
in the world of the mutant ninja turtles.; Ever since the unexpected success of the generally-dreadful first
film, the sequels have arrived at fairly regular intervals.","The movie is supposed to be an offbeat adventure/comedy, but the
action is dull and predictable, and the comedy, which consists of
numerous hackneyed one-liners, is singularly monotonous.; Quality obviously doesn't have anything to do with the appeal of
the turtles.; The first film was bad, the second worse, and the third
almost unbearable.; Not only is this movie aimed at young children,
the script could have been written by them.; What it turns out to be is
too violent for younger viewers and unbearably tedious for older ones."
1541.0,Thelma & Louise,1997.0,"The movie is pretty strong, the acting is quite wonderful and I recommend it.; THELMA AND LOUISE is a great film, undoubtedly one of the ten best
films that will be released in 1991, a film that may well find a place
on the 100-best list of films I have ever seen.; The photography of the great Southwest
is certainly visually stunning.; Still, the film's message about feminism
and, in general, freedom comes on a little strong.; We want to see his attitudes and behavior punished, but like
Louise, we have strong second thoughts as to whether his crimes deserve the
death penalty.","But, unfortunately for the film's fate in this review, the quality
just isn't very good, which meant that I had time to start thinking
politics.; THELMA AND LOUISE is a sci-fi film that suffers from a terrible
lack of vision on Ridley Scott's part.; While the rapist
certainly has none of the audience's sympathy, killing him seems
unnecessary.; But don't decide not to see the
film because it is anti-male and a poor representation of liberated
women.; Are men supposed to be all soft crybabies
or drooling apes in 1991?"
1542.0,Office Space,1998.0,"""Office Space"" is effective in its details and has many wonderful moments of
biting satire.; In a small supporting role, Gary Cole, from A SIMPLE PLAN, delivers the
best performance of the movie.; The first
act is very funny as it utilizes a lot of character interaction to get the
ball rolling and establish the satirical, often cartoony setting.; ""Office Space"" paints such an amusingly dead-on 
portrait of office life that many of the jokes and sight-gags - ranging 
from en-route rush hour to hungry fax machines to cramping cubicles - 
are irresistible in a unanticipatedly honest way.; This enjoyable enough comedy about
the plight of office workers everywhere centres around a disenchanted
computer programmer who finds himself unexpectedly promoted, despite
his best efforts to get himself fired from his mundane job.","Just not amusing enough.; His maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy
script, for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an
amateur scribe can make.; The lead
character (Ron Livingston, from 'Swingers') is basically a mutation of
the Job character from the bible, complaining to a hypnotherapist that,
'Since I started working, every single day has been worse than the day
before, so that every day you see me is the worst day of my life.'; Our hero, Peter
Gibbons (Livingston), finds trying to maneuver through traffic with the
thousands of other nine-to-fivers is a tedious, painful chore.; Combined with the
moth-eaten, patchwork plot, a less funny movie could have been downright
bad."
1548.0,Ghost World,1956.0,"The
relationship and physical attraction that bond Enid and Seymour is frank,
believable and, sometimes, touching.; What makes ""Ghost World"" worthwhile are the terrific performances from 
Thora Birch as the ultimate counter culture wiseass and Steve Buscemi, who
finds exactly the right note for a difficult character.; With ""Ghost World,"" 
writer-director Terry Zwigoff has crafted one of the best films of the year, 
a movie that takes a painstakingly realistic look at the difficulties of 
growing up.; Enid's fascinated because Seymour knows who he is and has housed himself 
in his own weird world of old 78s and vintage artifacts.; Johansson does a
solid job in the diminished role.","2001 - 111 minutes 
Rated R (for profanity).; My son Jeffrey, age 12, who didn't find anything in movie to interest him, gave
it just 1/2 of a star.; Rated R.  Running time: 111 minutes.; At this point Becky pretty much falls out of the picture.; Enid calls pretending to be that woman and leaves a
message on his answering machine to meet her at a vintage '50s retro diner."
1572.0,Die Hard: With a Vengeance,,"Nonetheless
there's a refreshing lambency in spots.; Part 3 may not be as good as the other DIE HARD movies,
but it is good, non-stop action and explosions.; And it feels fresh, thanks to a 
strong cast, a great plot, and the best location for filming on the face 
of the earth.; This was an excellent opportunity for numerous exciting and
breath-taking action scenes in which McTiernan again showed
his great talent for this brand of filmmaking.; But history has repeated itself: the film is
Hollywood entertainment at it's best, a roller-coaster ride that is the
most satisfying movie of the summer.","At worst, it is a terribly cliched action
flick, with a horrible villain.; Even worse, they borrow material from
PULP FICTION when the original jokes have run out.; Samuel L. Jackson (from PULP FICTION among others) does okay with
a poor script that kept falling back on racial insults in a poor
attempt to prop up weak writing.; Poor editing is one reason I came up with.; The answer that director John McTiernan (who directed the original ""Die 
Hard"" as well as films like ""Predator"" and ""The Last Action Hero"") and 
screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh come up with is a disappointment."
1573.0,Die Hard 2,1992.0,"This is an enjoyable action film: nothing requiring great thought, but
certainly enjoyable.; It really is an incredible sight, one of the best explosions put
on film.; It was a fabulous thriller and a well planned action
movie, with plenty of amazing stunt work and expensive (!); The best performance has to go to Dennis Franz,
who's police is very good.; This
movie is at its finest in 70mm at a theater with a good sound system.","The film has zero credibility, and all of the characters come off as
cliched, cardboard cut-outs.; What a pity that Die Hard 2: Die Harder (based on the novel 58 Minutes)
falls into the trap of being just another Die Hard in Washington's
Dulles Airport.; A little eggnog, a fuckin' Christmas tree, a little
turkey.; For me Die Hard 2 is the weakest of the three, but that
don't mean that it's a bad film at all.; After the
disjointed disappointment of ROBOCOP 2 and the utter idiocy of GREMLINS
2, I must say I went into DIE HARDER with a few reservations."
1588.0,Bring It On,1998.0,"A strong B+.; Overall, Hurrah for this little film, it's a good time.; To me that was an altogether refreshing
adventure filled with the vigor that makes Hollywood the envy
of world cinema.; It's nice to see a well-crafted, thoughtful film that
shows what kids are like at their best.; How you feel about this movie may depend on your
response to Nicholas Hytner's recent ""Center Stage,"" about
the world of dance--not just ballet, but also salsa, modern,
jazz and aerobics.","Actually, the 
only reason I was talked into seeing this movie was because I was curious 
how Bendinger would write an ending that would avoid being both cliched and 
politically incorrect.; This is just a silly,
formulaic movie with stock characters who are pretty to ogle.; Only some lively performances save this from the
scrap heap of the truly dreadful.; The movie ends with dull outtakes that 
are so clearly preprogrammed that they aren't really outtakes at all.; However 
aside from the mostly good facts of the film, there is also the bad things."
1592.0,Primal Fear,2000.0,"I highly recommend Primal Fear, it is a smart well written film that is
can't be missed.; Thus begins a film that has more twists and turns, ups
and downs, all tense and exciting, than a roller coaster ride.; Two outstanding performances and a terrific plot.; Alfre Woodard, a fine actress, is
perfect as the judge..; The story will keep you on the edge of your seat.","Hell,
even the ill-fitting *costumes* are bad!; Not only is it extremely forgettable, it doesn't really
have much to do with the film, as far as I could determine.; As a result, cheap theatrics are thrown in 
to spice things up, and, in the process, wreck any semblance of 
credibility.; Despite an enormous amount of plotting,
the film lacks any real sense of urgency.; She acts like she is just there to read her
lines, and they should have paided her extra if they wanted her to put
in any feeling."
1597.0,Meet the Parents,1993.0,"Still, MEET THE PARENTS is very funny and well put together, especially for a 
broad mainstream comedy.; ""Great!; And, we
liked this movie.; Despite this, and the fact that the trailer gave too much away, the film
is still very fun and very entertaining.; CRITIQUE:
A very funny movie that is able to combine a great premise with ideal
actors, laugh out scenes with a sentimental touch and over the top sequences
with a believable story line.","Teri Polo is so bland and forgettable as Greg's girlfriend 
that she hardly seems worth all the trouble - that may be cruel but consider 
what someone with far more personality and range could have done with this 
role, say Lisa Kudrow or Uma Thurman?; Unfortunately, Stiller does have to struggle against an inconsistent
script and flaccid direction.; Unfortunately, the screenplay by Jim Herzfeld and
John Hamburg seems to operate under the assumption that we will naturally
root for Greg, no matter how absurd or extreme his behaviour.; So messy, I just can't give the film the A- I would like to give 
it.; Greg keeps trying to make a good impression, 
but things go from bad, to worse, to absolutely miserable in less than 24 
hours."
1598.0,Cape Fear,1999.0,"The movie is a good one..................................ENJOY!; The photography, using reverse (negative) images in the beginning
and at the very end of the film is well done.; And the role of Cady, the ex-con who has come ""to help""
his ex-lawyer, gives the fullest possible play to DeNiro's willingness
to overwhelm with excessiveness.; The whole
cast was great!; And it succeeds beautifully.","The effort is strained in the context
      of the ridiculous story.; He seems ridiculous and
      impossible while the movie is going on.; Another example of the excesses of this film, incidentally, are Cady's
religious tattoos.; Behind the
hair slicked back with black grease and the big obnoxious cigar is the agile
mind of a chess master.; But here's where the film falls apart: * Overall, the plot assaults you with improbabilities at every
      turn."
1610.0,Fever Pitch,1997.0,"It isn't a soccer movie as much as it
about obsession with soccer.; The ones that work have a more natural flow
to them than some of what we are presented with in Paul's adulthood.; Colin Firth's Paul is a very effective character; his
everyday Joe affability mixes ominously with his uncomfortably deep
obsession with what is merely a hobby for most.; Besides his life as an adult, the film also tracks some of Paul's
childhood; specifically how his father inspired his love for soccer.; Having lived in Europe for nine years, I experienced first hand the
sensation that is soccer.","""They were f***ing rubbish last year.; The
two spend the whole movie giving each other wounded looks -- when they
aren't bitching, that is.; And I don't care if they are top of the League, they'll be
f***ing rubbish this year, too.; The biggest problem with Fever Pitch is the pseudo-romance at the heart
of the plot.; And they were f***ing rubbish the
year before."
1618.0,Still Crazy,1996.0,"Still Crazy boasts a solid rock pedigree, with new songs
written by Mick Jones (of Foreigner fame) and Jeff Lynne (from ELO,
etc).; Initially, Still Crazy seems to suggest another hilarious piss
take on the rock and roll lifestyle a la Spinal Tap, but this funny
movie follows a different tack.; Still Crazy will appeal strongly to the over thirty
crowd, who may well get a kick out of the film, and have fun
identifying some of the thinly veiled pop references along the way.; Still Crazy is a good example of an ensemble working together.; PLANET SICK-BOY: http://www.sick-boy.com When Still Crazy was nominated for two Golden Globe awards (Best Picture
[Comedy] and Best Original Song [Comedy]) in January, most people had
never heard of it.","The only part
that was even remotely like Monty was when the band auditions a young
`hired gun' to play guitar for their tour, in place of Brian.; Actually, his performance isn't noteworthy
at all, but he does look like a cross between Anthony LaPaglia in So I
Married an Axe Murderer and MTV's Tom Green.; Approved: graham@ee.washington.edu

Summary: r.a.m.r.; Robinson looks eerily like a washed-up rock
star.; This year's most blatant example is
this British comedy, which is certainly pleasant enough to watch but
completely forgettable."
1621.0,Trading Places,1927.0,"Some very important issues are tackled, but in an enjoyable
and entertaining fashion.; It's great.; Rent this thoroughly enjoyable film.; All the acting is superb.; You can tell everyone had fun making this movie and
yet took their roles seriously.","I can't think of anyone who gave even a
mediocre performance.; The movie then goes a bit dead near the middle, with not much
going.; Why don't actors always take their jobs this seriously
anymore?; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
1632.0,Mississippi Burning,1996.0,"Hackman's character in MISSISSIPPI BURNING is fascinating and the
most intriguing aspect of the film.; The photography, while at times atmospheric, in general is realistic
and includes liberal (if that is the word) doses of violence realistic
enough to bother some viewers.; It is a captivating bit of filmmaking, expertly capturing
a feeling of strong racial prejudice that should not be lost.; MISSISSIPPI BURNING evokes immense hatred towards its villains.; With the very first shot of MISSISSIPPI BURNING Alan Parker sets
the tone for what is to come and creates a feel for the South in 1964.","Watching DaFoe and Hackman ride off into the sunset, with black
and white children singing together, is sugar-coating what happened in the
worst way; it's almost as if Parker had never left advertising for feature
films.; And more importantly, why did he have to base the film on a
true incident?; Unless you really enjoy exploding mailboxes.; There are a few good points in the film.; He tosses in a romantic interest for Hackman, whose assault
rankles him to try to find the murderers even if he has to break the law to do
it."
1633.0,Fried Green Tomatoes,1960.0,"It is one of the rare stories that has it
all: happiness, sadness, friendship, romance, death, mystery, laughter, tears;
a celebration of life and regular people.; This is a feel-good laugher-weeper.; Winning performances and great characters make this worth seeing,
and those who are left wanting more should definitely read the book.; By the time Idgie is in her late teens and still in self-imposed exile,
her mother brings Ruth back to intervene, as she will be in Whistle Stop for
the summer.; There are several scenes that weren't in the book that, for the most part,
served as the hints to the true nature of their relationship.","No, wait, ""At First Sight"" is just a bad
movie.; The vignettes
in Evelyn's story just take too much time from what substance there
might have been in the flashback.; 1991, 137 min., Not Rated (See below for details).; The real problem with the screenplay is that *too
much* must have been left out.; The story is nothing
greatly original."
1634.0,Free Willy,1997.0,"Lori Petty plays Rae with a refreshing twist.; will be able to overlook
the cliches and appreciate the age-old themes of freedom and
belonging.; After years of
cinematic embarrassments like Darryl Hannah as an astrophysicist or,
more recently, Laura Dern as a paleobotanist, Petty's portrayal of a
marine biologist gives new hope to girls across the nation.; Instead, this film weaves a
simple-yet-effective tale about a boy and his whale.; seemed like that
rare treat--an infectious end title song.","He's supposed to be half-way to irreversible delinquency, but looks
like he's on leave from the Mickey Mouse Club.; Back in the late seventies, Dino DeLaurentis, the master of
overbudgeted, poorly-written films, came out with a movie called ORCA:
THE KILLER WHALE.; ), but disintegrates into a sickly
spoken piece that put an end to the clapping and started a mass
exodus.; The characters in FREE WILLY aren't quirky or original of course,
but neither are they offensively stereotyped.; His
previous effort, which he directed, was a little-known and muddled
fantasy about abused children."
1636.0,Bedazzled,1997.0,"Clearly exhibiting that she's having a fun time, Hurley digs into 
the tricky role with great relish, being both very funny and, at times, 
surprisingly threatening.; It's a wonderfully original and entertaining comedy--the rarest of 
breeds.; I really liked a couple of the situations that Brendan was placed in,
especially the extra-sensitive guy routine, which was really well done and
quite funny, and the whole basketball sequence, which was also very
well-handled, both effects-wise and the humor.; I can forgive the Hollywoodization of the wish thing, mainly because it
gives Fraser the chance to play a variety of different roles, putting a
unique spin on each.; Hurley makes a
surprisingly believable Satan.","The result could have been worse, I suppose,
but naturally my recommendation would be to see the original rather
than the remake.; Of course, I
guess this is unavoidable if you're simply trying to pad out 90 minutes
of screen time with something.; What this film does
offer that the first film did not is some machine guns, a short
chase involving a helicopter, and a large traffic accident, all
fairly common and by now boring stuff.; The moral in ""Bedazzled"" is so
slapped on that the filmmakers actually feel the need to have a
character state it aloud.; When they put their own
movie on cruise control, you wonder why they bothered with the project
at all."
1639.0,Speed 2: Cruise Control,1995.0,"But it's
refreshing that he's working alone.; Overall, Speed 2 is a most enjoyable thrill ride.; Speed 2 is an action movie and makes no other efforts, and that is what makes 
it so enjoyable.; The sound is incredible and should 
be seen in a DTS equipped theatre.; Quite effective.","I didn't honestly reliase that
action movies get much dumber, or boring than this.; I mean wasting 30
million on a sea port, for ten very mediocre final minutes - I say
donate the money to UNICEF instead.; If Jan de Bont directed ""Twister"" and
""Speed"", he should have shown better judgement, than to waste money on a
poorly written sequel of megalomaniac proportions.; A lot of
that is missing from this sequel that suffers from being nothing more than a
crashing bore.; Bullock is astoundingly annoying in this film and director Jan DeBont
who made the first film and 1996's 'Twister' should have recognized the bad
jokes, frumpy dialogue and razor thin interest that 'Speed 2' would generate."
1649.0,Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey,1998.0,"And some of it is very funny.; He and the boys do a particularly satisfying send-up of
Bergman's chess-playing Death.; I never
saw BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, but now I would like to.; Winter reminds me of Sean Penn's benevolent twin and Reeves may be
a little long in the tooth for the role now, but together they are
energetic, cheerful, well-intentioned, and unsinkable.; It's quite intellectual.","However, with this much fluff, I can't recommend you pay more than cheap
matinee prices.; Really, I didn't have a choice, I was just following orders.; Lyndol and I *needed* to see film, it
was too daunting to drive all the way to the art-film district (20
miles) and we didn't want to see anything else in the 'burbs (that we
hadn't already seen), such as PROBLEM CHILD 2 or REGARDING HENRY.; So, unless you're terminally serious, you'll have a good time.; But first, let me salvage my reputation as a Serious Film Guy."
1662.0,State of Grace,2000.0,"So I recently caught STATE OF GRACE on video and--although I don't
think it is as good as the other two films mentioned above--I thought it
offered some great moments--and a great performance by Gary Oldman.; Penn can still communicate more with his
face and body language than most screen actors can do with a hundred
great lines.; I saw him
recently in ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD, where he gives
another great performance, and also in PRICK UP YOUR EARS.; I think Oldman outshines Sean Penn in STATE OF GRACE--one of Penn's
more low-key performances.; Late last year, three gangster movies involving some of the world's
best actors and directors were released at the same time: GOODFELLAS,
MILLER'S CROSSING and STATE OF GRACE.","Another problem with the movie--the script focused on an ethnic
subculture and old way of life under attack, but none of the lead
characters seemed very ethnic to me.; It
seemed gratuitous to me--lots of showy, bloody, slow-motion shoot-outs
with bags of fake blood exploding all over the place.; This sort of
cinema ultra-violence went out with Butch Cassidy and Bonnie and
Clyde--at least I thought so.; He seems to have had
some training as a classical actor, as he jumps around with grace and
abandon and seems to know fencing.; Funny, I recently saw THE FIELD, where the characters were
definitely Irish, but which suffered from an overwrought and silly
script."
1689.0,Little Buddha,1996.0,"And there is the world of prince
Siddhartha, 2500 years ago and today, colorful and juicy, a paradise,
but also a place of suffering, decrepitude and death.; Truly beautiful music.; Bronze, buffed, and beautiful,
he makes a most excellent Enlightened Dude.; Outstanding music, beautifully designed and blending into the colors
of the film, in some quiet and subtle ways that just slowly crop up, and
start to make you feel it
all.; Intriguing, entertaining, and ultimately relaxing, Bernardo
Bertolucci's primer on Tibetian Buddhism tells the story of a 9
year-old-son Seattle son (Wiesendanger) who may bear the spirit of a
great Tibetian lama.","Whatever 
the reason, however, the characters never connect with the audience, 
causing LITTLE BUDDHA to test the viewer's attention span when it should 
instead be soaring.; Considering the otherwise-impeccable 
production standards, it's odd that this portion of the project should 
have been handled so imperfectly.; LITTLE BUDDHA runs 2:03 and editing by Pietro Scalia should have
been tighter.; I
think Keanu Reeves (e.g., in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING -  like his acting
abilities) is a terrible actor.; If
someone comes to your doorstep claiming to be a Buddhist monk and says
he wants you to leave your young son at the local temple for
examination since your son might have been reincarnated, would you a)
slam the door, b) call the police, or c) leave your little boy at the
temple?"
1700.0,Misery,1993.0,"Wonderful stuff.; But if you don't go into it
expecting the atmosphere that King labored so hard to create or the
tension and claustrophobia that pervaded his novel, the Phantom thinks
you'll find it well worth seeing.; MISERY is a tight, tense, intense and chillingly
entertaining thriller.; But it's a terrifically effective film, and therefore the daft climax is
easily overlooked.; This is basically a very simple tale, but it achieves a large degree of
eloquence in its simplicity.","If it weren't so gorey it would almost be
laughable.; But after
you're done, you might feel vaguely dissatisfied, and at the very least
you'll have an awful lot of paper -- much of which is strewn with brand
names -- to dispose of.; The
limit was three books per person and even with that limit King could have
easily spent twelve hours straight just autographing books for his fans.; Frances Sternhagen, who
plays a deputy in the small town where this takes place, appears to be
nothing but a wasted role.; Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen
as a husband and wife sheriff and deputy have some chemistry but not enough
screen time really to show it."
1701.0,Con Air,1997.0,"But ""Con Air"" gets that right 
pitch of fun-filled action with huge lapses in logic and a great, witty 
screenplay from Scott Rosenberg (of indie fame - ""Beautiful Girls"" and 
""Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead).; All the actors do a fine job: Malkovitch is disturbing and twisted; Cage is
solemn and also with a twinkle of smarts in his eye; Cusack is
irrepressible; Meaney is hilarious.; And yet there it is, and
it's great fun.; Still, I enjoyed this picture more than I expected to, and it has 
a lot to do with the cast.; Poe, of
course, is going to need lots of equipment for his flight, so he is
gifted with special training with the US Army Rangers (twice
decorated, if I recall), a very strong but easily bruised sense of
loyalty, and a secure place in society (his lovely family).","What a total waste of potential there.; If you're looking for a 
film of substance, avoid this machismo-fest at all costs.; If you're
looking for trashy rubbish with no oringinality however, you could do worse
than this.; These guys are bad, bad,
bad.; Sometimes I just don't know what's worse: a movie that's bad from start to
finish, or a bad movie which every once in a while shows a moment of
creativity, but then returns to being bad."
1702.0,Death Machine,1999.0,"Despite its gaping flaws there is a certain compelling power to the film's 
furious pace, weird sets and comic book action.; The film takes place inside the labrynthine complex where Dante works among 
his machines and computers.; It is indestructible and unstoppable, its miles of exposed wiring 
and delicate computer systems impervious to massive explosions in confined 
spaces.; You've seen _The Seven Samurai_ umpteen times.; Starring: Brad Dourif, Ely 
Pouget, William Hootkins, John Sharian
Reviewed By Michael A. Turton You know how it is.","Some slimeball has rented _Diva_.; Why not just pull the wiring out or poke a thick 
hydraulic finger into an on-board computer?; When it really gets fired up, the creature clicks its claws and 
spins its head back and forth, creating moments of unintentional humor in 
the middle of some rather touch-and-go scenes for the characters.; It has all the usual flaws of 
action movies: actors who check their talents at the door, guns which never 
need reloading, injured people performing acts of superhuman strength and 
plot holes big enough to float the Seventh Fleet, complete with a psycho 
muttering the required cliched nonsense as self-justification.; It really 
should come with a disclaimer: SOME SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF REQUIRED."
1722.0,Captain Corelli's Mandolin,1999.0,"John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") brings the popular Louis de Bernieres
novel, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, to the big screen in a lush, beautifully
crafted movie that turns out to be more than just a love story.; ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin,"" then, is, like ""Pearl Harbor,"" both a
war story and a romance, more realistic than Michael Bay and
Jerry Bruckheimer's summer blockbuster in the courtship
department but quite a bit less flashy in scenes of combat.; When he is stationed, with his
artillery battery, on Cephallonia, he sees beautiful Pelagia amidst the
island's citizens and is immediately smitten.; Films about love and war should have pathos and grit, and Corelli's
gives us smatterings of each.; Adapted from the best-selling novel by Louis de Bernieres, the story
begins in 1941.","His learning must come
strictly from experience since he couldn't possibly raise the
money to acquire books--in one scene he's shown getting paid
for medical treatment with a live chicken.; This is too bad, because when the central character of
a movie leaves a hole the size of Naples, the rest of the movie is hard-pressed
not to sink right through it.; As if we haven't already had our fill of wartime romances this summer,
Mandolin tries awfully hard to be The English Patient but instead is only
slightly less ridiculously annoying than Pearl Harbor (with fewer
explosions, to boot).; Rated R.  Running time: 127 minutes.; They made it
seem like he was working on a cure for cancer, and the fact is, his accent
is horrible."
1772.0,City of Hope,1999.0,"At first glance, CITY OF
HOPE might seem his most 'ordinary': a story of the effect of corrupt
politics and business on different socio-economic levels.; It's a great dance that Sayles choreographs -
he obviously finds enjoyment in the immeasurable ways in which people
affect each others' lives.; ), Chris
Cooper (Riggs); Runtime: 129; Samuel Goldwyn Co.; 1991) John Sayles and his ensemble cast present an intensely dramatic political story
of a corrupt and decaying fictional city in New Jersey, ironically called ""City
of Hope.""; As for its dramatics, I found the romance between Spano and Williams to be very
believable and moving.; He is trapped in all the political
payoffs that come with his office, as he must bargain and compromise himself
with the city administration to get things for his community.","When Spano quits his
construction job in the film's opening scene, he is setting himself up
for a fall: without any useful function for the city he automatically
becomes expendable - he fails to emulate the example of several other
characters who want to be recognized as separate identities in their
community (Sayles has everyone use each other's first name
repeatedly).; The film is crowded with at least thirty characters trying to tell
their urban horror story.; Sayles gets away with
this by treating them in such a fragmentary manner that we don't
really expect all the loose ends to tie up anyhow.; The film offers observations and
not answers.; When Nick pulls a
foolish electronics warehouse robbery, to pay off his gambling debts, along with
his buddies Zip (Graff) and Bobby (Jace), organized by someone he hates, a
sleazebag small-time crook and owner of a crooked auto repair shop, Carl
(Sayles), the robbery is botched but Nick escapes."
1783.0,To End All Wars,2000.0,"It is a stirring 
and believable account of camp life.; TO END ALL 
    WARS is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to 
    retain their humanity and their dignity.; Men already imprisoned tell the new 
arrivals to enjoy the last of their health; it will not last long 
with parasites and disease almost inevitable.; The 
film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being 
considerably more brutal and sadistic than BRIDGE ON THE RIVER 
KWAI portrayed them.; Before the 
film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the 
character of the prisoners and the character of those running the 
camp.","The best thing 
for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so 
short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day.; This led them to do some very 
inhuman things in pursuit of that goal.; The color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out 
yellow.; There were some low-budget British exploitation films and that was 
about it.; And 
just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll."
1788.0,Footloose,1963.0,"The title track, performed by
Kenny Loggins, is upbeat and fun.; By the end of the
film, we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and
the Lori Singer character.; Anyway, ""Footloose"" is a charming little surprise.; His wife Vi (a superb performance by Dianne Wiest) is the voice
of reason in the house, serving as a mediator between the two sides.; Another nice touch is the music.","Moore -- over a proposed senior prom, interestingly ""Footloose"" does not
condemn the church.; Ironically, the Reverend is a much better father to the
community than he is to his 17-year-old daughter Ariel (Lori Singer),
one of the sassiest and most obnoxious kids around.; Instead of looking like a buffoon, Rev.; Of course,
I soon realized that would be a little pathetic.; In fact, the only thing that truly dates the
movie is its soundtrack, which holds up lame metal acts like Quiet Riot
and Moving Pictures as examples of ""subversive music""; if this kind of
stuff was considered shocking, imagine what the Bomontians would have
made of Marilyn Manson and Korn."
1808.0,Velvet Goldmine,1996.0,"It's been said that Todd Haynes' ""Velvet Goldmine,"" the film that
chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement, not only from
those who experienced it but by those who created it, steals a lot from
""Citizen Kane,"" and that's true.; The best sequence, though, may be the beginning, following the prelude,
a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of
the movement and the post-movement era.; However, for the most part, the engaging part of this
film is not the story but rather the way in which Haynes creates this
world, by using his sets, costumes, cinematography, and especially the
music to play as characters in his film.; The film works best as a music video and if you like the music, you'll
probably love the film.; The pieces are familiar, but they don't quite fit together.","The screenplay might have worked if Haynes had written
Slade as effectively bastardly as someone like Chad in Neil LaButes In
the Company of Men, but he reveals no level of talent that would allow
coherent writing to last for more than just a couple of minutes.; It's just that,
with iconic characters and an incoherent narrative, the film fails to
draw in its audience.; Another writing misstep is the
clunky, forced way Haynes directly ties Arthur's past to Brian's; it would
have been less contrived if Arthur were simply a fan on the fringes.; Jonathan Rhys Meyers looks laughable in the title role, giving Slade a
pompous and wanky presence thanks to a weak screenplay and some
extravagant 70's costumes.; The only actor who rises
above the material is Bale, but even Arthur's connection with Slade --
which is where the emotional grounding is supposed to come from -- isn't
well-developed."
1832.0,Dogma,2001.0,"Dogma is very funny stuff, with plenty of great one liners,
Smith's irreverent, iconoclastic sense of humour, and the usual pop
culture references.; Rock is superb as the apostle 
with a mission, playing his part perfectly.; It's not
perfect, and Smith's indulgences get in the way of the narrative (such as it
is) too often, suggesting he hasn't completely mastered his use of a bigger
budget, but it's still a funny, entertaining experience.; Rickman and Fiorentino are wonderful as the best-drawn
characters in the story.; Alan Rickman gives what may be my favorite performance of the
year as a sardonic angel.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; * - One of the worst movies ever.; * * - Pretty bad.; * * - Pretty bad.; The problem in this movie lies not in the cast nor the idea, but 
in the general lack of jokes."
1844.0,Entrapment,1997.0,"""Entrapment"" is good, clean, escapist fun.; Connery will always be remembered as the
definitive James Bond, and in Entrapment, part of the fun is watching
him replay certain shades that made his portrayal of the famous spy so
popular.; He is the best of
the best, and has never been caught.; The movie itself is skillfully directed by John Amiel, who
infuses the story with plenty of action and entertaining moments.; Entrapment
is a great looking film.","But it is bad...very bad.; Nothing seems particularly inventive or original, so
the whole movie lacks suspense and drags (it runs nearly two hours).; You exit  looking terrible.; It's not that Entrapment is a very bad movie, just a
very indifferent one.; With a little more daring, while never talking to the mind,
Entrapment could have spoken to the heart  had it propped up its awfully
dull dialogue and un-propped the stage props."
1890.0,Children of a Lesser God,1996.0,"Add to the movie a second level, a difficult character Sarah (Marlee Matlin,
who one the Best Actress award), the deaf ex-nymphomaniac in love with the
hearing man (William Hurt), who gives a terrific performance and is deaf to
boot.; On the surface, it functions as a
sympathy grabber for the hearing disabled, and a movie we can smile at
because of William Hurt's gallant attempt to help deaf children speak, live
normal lives, and, even, sing (albeit to cheesy songs but in one of the most
fun and touching scenes captured on film).; Those that kick, on
the other hand, have metaphors that are silent and effective.; In a form drawn out of proportion so that it is unrecognizable until you
think, Children of a Lesser God is not about deaf people but about the
difficulties we all face in relationships.; Directed by Randa Haines (Dance With Me) Written by Mark Medoff (Play) (Santa Fe) and Hesper Anderson (Grand Isle)
Starring William Hurt (Dark City), Marlee Matlin (The Player), Piper Laurie
(The Faculty) In my mind there are two types of metaphor movies: those that kick and those
that scream.","Those that scream take their metaphors and make them painfully
obvious to the viewer.; No.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; That would make the critics happy."
1892.0,Return of the Jedi,1997.0,"Highly
recommended.; As a film per se, RETURN OF THE JEDI is a very good
entertainment; but as a part of a saga, it works beautifully
despite all of its flaws.; Overall, Return of the Jedi is a good film.; With the spectacular, new special effects, the adorable
Ewoks, the sinister Jabba the Hutt, the evil Emperor, the same old
Millenium Falcon, Darth Vader's incredible betrayal, the destruction of
the new Death Star, and the always lovable Yoda, Return of the Jedi
concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang.; The story about Darth Vader and his redemption is great.","The worst example is the beginning in the Jabba's
palace - pandemonium of different and bizarre aliens looks
too much like a bad episode of Muppet Show, and the obvious
blue screen of the Luke's fight with Rancor monster haven't
been improved even in the Special Edition.; Jabba is nothing more than grotesque, and Emperor
looks like a caricature of Death in Bergman's SEVENTH SEAL.; Forced again to play stereotypes,
actors didn't have much opportunity to excel.; Then there's the 
unbelievably cheap cop-out that Lucas uses to erase the Luke/Han/Leia 
triangle.; Worse still, it slows down a film
which got repetitive even in its original incarnation."
1921.0,Sweet November,1996.0,"He's the best of the best, 
and he knows it.; Still I enjoyed what I enjoyed and will remember the sparkling 
zest for life and the strong heart of this picture.; Jason Isaacs (the villainous Col. Tavington in 2000's ""The 
Patriot"") is a standout as Chaz, the best friend/neighbor of Sara's, offering 
up a strong amount of wisdom and sweetness, while Michael Rosenbaum (1998's 
""Urban Legend"") shows much promise in the small role of his caring boyfriend.; Keanu sarcastically replies, ""Just hearing that makes me feel healed.""; Ultimately, the movie is far from perfect, and the 
running time is about fifteen minutes past its prime, but it genuinely 
surprises by saving itself with the gently done, powerful conclusion.","I don't know what was worse: the *absolutely, positively mindboggling*
[in case the KeanuDroids didn't hear me the first time] miscasting of
Keanu ""whoa"" Reeves, or the complete repulsion I felt in noting Greg
Germann's irritating presence in not one, but *two* lame remake flicks
this weekend (""November"" and the equally dreadful DOWN TO EARTH).; Reeves' `efforts' fail to make the
strained attraction any more natural--not that anything about his work in
this film can remotely fall into that description.; His stiff yet
overdone swagger as Norman `A' is ridiculous; try not to laugh when he
lets loose what is supposed to be an evil, mischievous cackle toward his
boss.; Both films are about a dying woman who takes on one
dysfunctional man each month of her last year on Earth in some bizarre
attempt to...to...okay, I have no idea why she does it.; Even the direction and editing lag here."
1934.0,Shakespeare in Love,1996.0,"It's funny, romantic, highly entertaining and even brilliant
at times.; You don't have to
know Shakespeare to enjoy this incandescent film but the more you
know, the more you will appreciate its hilarious wit.; But that's the conundrum facing the illustrious Bard at 
the outset of ""Shakespeare in Love,"" a deliciously witty and inventive 
comedy drama that reminds us once again of the true genius of England's 
greatest writer.; Admirers of Shakespeare will love it, but non-afficionados will
also find it an enjoyable comedy.; Ben Affleck, playing one of the actors in the
company, shows great range, both in his accent (his is almost as good as
Paltrow's) and in humor (he has some of the best one-liners in the
movie).","But not 
even they could save this sad excuse for a film, so it remains plagued 
by poor performances.; The only thing that doesn't appear
to be working is the play's title; ""Romeo and Ethel"" somehow
lacks the passion that the material requires.; (""Oh?; It's not 
good for morale.; (Perhaps
they all read the script and had too much sense.)"
1958.0,8½ Women,,"It brought up things that are taboo and showed how art is
a metaphor for one's obsessions in sex.; The film revolves around the woman collected, as the location of the
story moves from Kyoto, Japan, where the father closes a deal on
pachinko parlors (pinball games), to different parts of Europe.; The two bond further
by trading sexual fantasies: Storey's is that he's in love with his own
penis ever since he was a child and looked at himself in a double
mirror.; After he goes to the cinema with his son and sees Fellini's 8 1/2 (an
overated film that the passage of time has been unkind to), and watches
Mastroianni setting up a harem of women, this gives the son an idea on
how he can console his father, as he copies the film,  setting up a
harem in their Swiss estate.; Which is about the best way of explaining what this very personal
film means for Greenaway.","8 1/2 WOMEN (director/writer: Peter Greenaway; cinematographer: Sacha
Vierny; editor: Elmer Leupen; cast: John Standing (Philip Emmenthal),
Matthew Delamere (Storey Emmenthal), Polly Walker (Palmira), Amanda
Plummer (Beryl), Toni Collette (Griselda), Kirina Mano (Mio), Vivian Wu
(Kito), Natacha Amal (Giaconda), Giulietta (Manna Fujiwara); Runtime:
122; Lions Gate Films; 1999-Netherlands/UK/Ger/Lux) It's possible for Peter Greeaway (""Drowning by Numbers""/ ""A Zed and Two
Noughts""/``Prospero's Books'') to make a more boring sexual/erotic
fantasy film, one that is more didactic and analytical, but not likely
that he could duplicate one that is also so full of itself as this one
was.; The women collected who make some kind of
impression include a compulsive pachinko player (Shizuka Inoh) who gets
in gambling debt, thereby selling her body to Storey to cancel the debt,
with her approving husband by her side; Mio (Kirina Mano), a female
impersonator who happens to be female; a bizarre, horsewoman thief
(Amanda Plummer), in a neck brace and facially made up like Joel Grey
was in  ""Cabaret,"" who loves horses and sleeps with a pig; Griselda
(Collette), who is a Norwegian bankteller and a wannabe nun; a greedy
baby-making entrepenaur Giaconda (Natacha Amal) who sells her newborn
babies for as high as $25,000; and, best of all, the only performance
worth talking about in the film, the scheming Palmira (Polly Walker) as
the adventurous libertine, willing to sell her voluptious body to Philip
(she looks great in the nude).; It is the director's audacious opinion that he can get away without
having a story to go with the full frontal nudity display of men and
women he flaunts throughout the film.; It results in a torturous viewing
experience, as pablum is spouted in verbose spurts of emotive stagy
responses, while the reward for the viewer is a few stilted visual
delights and a few restrained chuckles to be had at the absurdity of all
the perversity.; The film didn't mean much to me, but it did say something about how
women understand sex better than men and men are such children when it
comes to sex."
1959.0,Swept from the Sea,1999.0,"Sir Ian McKellen is superb as the mild-mannered physician
who makes house calls--even in drenching downpours--whose
one weakness seems his inability to accept the romantic
involvement of the lovers.; The friendship between Dr. Kennedy and Yanko, though a familiar
retread, is nicely portrayed with a sense of warmth and compassion.; The only other person who is able to see anything human in Yanko
is Dr. James Kennedy (in an excellent portrayal by Ian McKellen).; ------------------------------------------------------------- Joseph Conrad's greatest contribution to cinema will undoubtedly be
his novel ""Heart Of Darkness"", crafted by Francis Ford Coppola into
the visionary landmark masterpiece APOCALYPSE NOW.; Unlike painting and literature, the cinema both gives to life
and takes from it..."" The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","It's just not much of one.; The film completely lacks the
cathartic dramatic punch with Amy's redeeming acts during the
climactic third act that is sorely needed -- granted, Ms. Weisz's
unempathic performance doesn't help either -- and employs devices
throughout the film which are clearly intended to be cute or magical,
such as the scenes of Dr. Kennedy's introduction to Yanko's
chess-playing abilities and Amy's secret hideaway, but merely come
off as silly or goofy.; Ackland and Bates offer predictably staunch support but, sadly,
there's not much meat here.; An early scene in SWEPT BY THE SEA is
particularly ineffective; while intended as a tender moment between
Amy and Yanko as the outsiders first meet, neither of the characters
have been sufficiently drawn out at this point for the audience to
have any vested interest in their fates, and consequently the
sequence loses its power and appears excessively cliched and
melodramatic.; In fact, it would be an insult to romantic drivel to use that 
appellation for SWEPT FROM THE SEA."
1968.0,Fools Rush In,1989.0,"""Fools"" is an immensely enjoyable film, perfect for those romantic
evenings with a significant other.; The fairy tale, a perfectly enjoyable
expression of our dreams, is no longer simply a supplement to realistic
love in the movies; it practically has replaced it entirely.; One
night, while waiting in line to use the bathroom at a mexican restuarant, he
meets Salma Hayek (who by the way is one of the most beautiful actresses
working today) and the two end up in bed together that night.; 'Fools Rush In' isn't necessarily well made in a lot
of areas but it is a heartfelt romantic adventure with the right doses of
comedy and drama mixed together.; Few romantic comedies
contain such a well-blended combination of humor, passion, and
believability.","Justification for
love through fate is one of the worst cop-outs, films like this use it to
make up for lack of chemistry.; If this wasn't predictable enough, there is even a
fish-out-of-water scene as Isabel drags Alex to her weekly family gathering,
saying he is her boyfriend of two months (which makes no sense because if she
sees her family every week, wouldn't the boyfriend issue have come up
already?).; ""Fools Rush In"" is a mediocre romantic comedy
that acts like a 2-hour sitcom, complete with predictable jokes, zany
overacting, and gags that don't work.; If it were
either genuine or if they have tried for parody, it might have worked,
but as delivered, the jokes fell like stones.; Sometimes characters like these can be
funny, but Perry's performance is so dry and the script is so shallow we
never get a sense of his character."
2028.0,Say Anything...,1994.0,"The movie doesn't break any new ground, but it's
surprisingly effective nevertheless.; That may, of course, be coincidental, but because
each triangle is resolved in a different and believable way, the films make
an excellent trilogy.; Cusack, Skye and Mahoney's characters are all wonderfully
written and acted, but the other exceptional point of this film is how well the
smaller roles are created and performed.; What is amazing -- what is truly amazing -- about
this film is that it is able to nurture the spirit of romance in a setting that
never forsakes its hold The Way Things Work to keep the romantic plot going.; It tells the
all-too-familiar story of young love between two recent high school
graduates.","But
unfortunately, SAY ANYTHING fails to say anything terribly new or profound
about young love.; SAY ANYTHING pushes the limits of its tired and worn-out
boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back story.; It
would be very easy to assume that this type of film had been all mined out
and that there was not much more that could be done with it.; He does know one thing, however: he'd like to spend
his summer with Diane.; He has no goals except to be a better kick-boxer and
to date Diane."
2033.0,Infinity,1999.0,"My favorite scenes there are
of the key punches, card sorters, plug board calculators they used in
lieu of real computers.; I give the show a
thumbs up and award it ** 1/2.; For, as effective as much of the film is, Feynman's 
apparent detachment at the end leaves us cold -- almost as if things 
matter more to us than they do to him.; And yet, I found the film soothing as a warm bath and
tranquil as a gentle breeze.; The cinematography by Toyomichi Kurita is warm and almost
hazy, and is nicely complemented by Bruce Broughton's dreamy music.","With no other
character in the film provided even a glimmer of a personality, INFINITY
rapidly begins to sink under the weight of a painfully dull central
relationship.; For nearly ninety minutes Arline is
alternately sick and well, and over the course of that ninety minutes we
move abstractly between Richard's personal and professional life, with
scene after scene inspiring me to throw up my hands in exasperation at the
utter lack of a point.; I counted ten scenes in INFINITY which literally
served no narrative or dramatic purpose, and countless other instances
where the judicious use of a knife on several hundred frames of film might
have made me less eager to use one on my own throat.; Arquette is more successful at giving Arline some small measure of appeal,
but she is unable to make this love affair matter.; You
just can't feed a critic a straight line like that; I'm only human, and
it's too easy."
2034.0,Training Day,1999.0,"The film, brilliantly directed by Antoine Fuqua, is fueled with
powerhouse performances.; In between is one terrific motion picture, albeit a
depressingly engrossing one.; The actor gives a good, not a great, performance in
a solid role that is counter to his usual noble, kind persona he normally
takes one.; It's altogether one of the year's
most thought-provoking films.; Nonetheless, as a character drama and as a stark 
reminder that life on the urban streets -- be it as denizen or as cop -- 
is never black and white, ""Training Day"" is compelling.","His character lacks
vigor and verve.; Disappointing it is, then, that David Ayer's script fails to keep up
with the pace of the actors; the story gets too reliant on contrivance and
coincidence to drive its final third.; It seemed likely that Jake would have gotten off this crooked
job offer faster, if this film had wanted to achieve anything resembling
reality.; As Alonzo hones in the worst of L.A. citizenry, I'd be curious to
know what various denizens of the America theater audience.; This sequence  which started out so promising 
drags the rest of the film down with it."
2043.0,Along Came a Spider,1979.0,"I
mean, I might see this movie slightly entertaining some who are willing to
forego its goofy twists and leaps of faith, but I think most people want
stories that are believable and realistic, right?; Megan may be a young child, but she is a clever, intelligent, and 
strong individual--quite a rare feat for such a small kidnap victim in the 
world of feature films.; He has an excellent knack
for hitting a line in a unique way, maybe emphasizing a word that others
wouldn't.; Listening to Detective Cross psychologize and philosophize
and guilt-trip, you'd think that, Great Scott!; Mika Boorem (2000's ""The Patriot""), as Megan Rose, is perhaps the standout in 
the film.","Skip this one babies, unless you're looking for a low-rent rehashed
version of many better thrillers with a crappy ending to boot.; So the
producers must have thought, why not try and cash in on another mediocre
thriller!; There are just too many holes
in the plotline of this hollow thriller for it to be convincing.; So what's next for Dr. Alex Cross if this one takes off?; The
trouble is that the genre has been rubbed into the ground, leaving Spider a
silly, clichéd disappointment."
2054.0,Mr. Holland's Opus,1994.0,"This was great.; Among the movies that focus strongly on truly dedicated 
schoolteachers, the more familiar titles include a classic 
""Goodbye Mr. Chips,"" as well as ""The Blackboard Jungle,"" ""To 
Sir, with Love,"" ""Conrack,"" ""Ciao Professore!,"" and the 
wonderfully quirky ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.""; The corny but fun script (Patrick Duncan) is peppered with great
little one liners.; This is definitely a message movie.; And unlike many films these
days, it had a message.","*    Bad.; It was
just not fitting.; The film tries too hard to
have a big finish and spoils much of its credibility.; But a bad
ending makes for a bad movie, and a bad movie is a bad movie.; x    This movie is so bad that it should be burned."
2067.0,Mission to Mars,1998.0,"First and foremost, a wonderful popcorn flick with
top-notch graphics and tense moments that could bring the chills of Apollo 13.; But it is a film that establishes good pace, offers
great visual effects, and tells a fine fictional tale.; Perhaps you will see this film and find yourself among its critics.; The gritty astronauts eventually do make their way to
the planet surface and discover some fascinating
information.; Gary
Sinise's performance is also solid.","* - One of the worst movies ever made.; I'd
venture to say it won't be worse than this waste of time.; Horrible.; ""Mission"" has some good ideas, but they get lost in the unbearably
boring delivery, dime-a-dozen dialogue, and spate of good actors
wasted in cardboard-cutout roles.; * * - Pretty bad, see it only if you have nothing better to do."
2086.0,Nick of Time,2000.0,"It's not the most realistic story, but it works for what
it is.; Still, ""Nick Of Time"" is a good, solid movie that is unlike anything I've
seen in a long time.; Most of the film is incredible.; ""Nick Of Time"" might not be the greatest film ever made but it is definitely
a landmark in filmmaking as it takes place in actual, real time.; Solid performances by Depp and Walken.","That way, you'll only waste half-an-hour on this lifeless 
thriller instead of the full ninety minutes.; Depp fails at becoming an action star with this film.; Skip this film unless you want to see the failed gimmick in action.; Too much time focussed on the clock ticking
away, and not enough time spent thinking through the mechanics of the
movie.; The gimmick fails to work, and one actor who can't
fill the action hero role and one actor who overacts also weight down the
film."
2105.0,American Pie,1996.0,"Highly recommended for teenagers (particularly males).; The entire cast deserves high 
marks: Klein, who played a similar character earlier this year in 
Election, is touching; Biggs, as the sympathetic Jim, is klutzy, but 
endearing; Nicholas shows a vulnerability and an awakening 
self-awareness; while Thomas is a bit cynical, yet as wanting as the 
others.; Great comedy makes one
think.; Still, amidst all of the buzz on 
""American Pie"" concerning its envelope-pushing humor, in essence what we 
really have here is a surprisingly sweet sex comedy that, unlike many recent 
""teen""-oriented pictures, is frightening in its realism of teen life.; And I'd heard
about how outrageous and funny and surprisingly moral it was.","It tries to be funny.; The film has no
point to make but to emphasize that silly challenge, but, it at least
softens its obnoxious attitude with an ending that is more satisfactory
than what I expected from this shallow film.; ""Pie"" is a bad
film.; Every joke was so obvious and repetitive that, by the time the credits
rolled, I felt as if I'd already seen the film half a dozen times [and
perhaps I have with different actors and titles].; Most of the
acting was pretty bad as well."
2112.0,Payback,1999.0,"I, especially, liked seeing Devane,
he is a throwback to the old noir foils.; Payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't be
remembered as being among Gibson's most important work, but is still one of
the finer films he's done.; The film works for all the above reasons, and most of
all it works, because Mel is great for the part.; One of the great aspects of ""Payback""
is the soundtrack from the era of rather crappy music--the late
70s and early 80s.; A fine film, even though it needs just a little something more to be the
kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation.","The
movie lacks danger.; If I had one big disappointment in this
film, it would be that Coburn didn't have a bigger role.; There is nothing
glamorous to show in the world of these slime-balls, but the dull
look doesn't mean it's ever dull to watch.; The film just ends far too suddenly, after a huge build-up in the
penultimate scenes.; Here, however, their character's capabilities are just
not very plausible and Gibson cannot carry the film the way Lee Marvin
did."
2118.0,L.A. Confidential,2001.0,"One of the best film noirs in a long
time, and well worth seeing.; Superb acting., wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing
gunfights ever.; This is a great
film and is a pleasant surprise for me.; An incredible script, wonderful music, perfect and sets
and lighting effects, and some of the best acting I've seen in a long time.; Everyone is pitch-perfect, the casting is stunning, and the direction 
is flawless.","The only possible disappointment is a poorly cultivated Lynn Bracken
(White's Love interest) played by a stunning Kim Basinger.; And I couldn't think of one scene
where I wasn't totally engrossed, a character who wasn't at least a bit
interesting (save the really small parts), and a performance which
didn't hit the nail on the head.; No
cardboard characters here.; So often when I take the time and money to go to a 
theater, I lose IQ points on the drivel that is tossed at me.; There are dozens of other plots, 
all connecting into one hell of a convoluted mess, which shouldn't work."
2123.0,"Me, Myself & Irene",1989.0,"Carrey gives a wonderful performance; both physically
and verbally.; Carrey may be the bigger 
personality of the two, but their quick interplay is the source of what makes 
""Me, Myself & Irene"" work so well, and Zellweger does excellent work as she 
reacts to Charlie's sweetness and Hank's lewd ways, as well as forms the 
center for the romance that ultimately forms between Charlie and herself.; Carrey gives a great, manic yet controlled physical performance.; Zellweger does an excellent job moving back and forth from being 
infuriated with Hank to crazy over Charlie and treating it like it makes 
perfect sense.; Fortunately, things pick up heading into the home stretch, especially 
once Charlie and Hank start to coexist simultaneously.","The film's vulgarity quotient is just absurd and 
offensive.; The film's vulgarity quotie
nt is just absurd and offensive.; First, the plot is 
useless, cliched, boring, predictable, and a lot more complicated than it 
needed to be (that probably sounded like five reasons, didn't it?; It's just not that funny.; Recycled waste served up as a
fresh dish, causes me to paint Yellow lights, Red."
2140.0,Kiss of the Dragon,1999.0,"You may or may
not believe this but as you watch Jet Li in action in the role of
China's top government police agent, Liu Jian, you might easily
go along with the notion that this guy of medium height and build
could be the finished product of China's long and often glorious
record.; Jet Li has played bad guys, and he has played good guys, and it isn't 
easy to tell the difference.; We're not sure that Liu can
easily knock out an army of twenty black belts whom he meets in
a building and who happily take him on, but Liu has the benefit of
one good friend to help him: Marco Cave, who is the most
powerful man in the movie.; He plays Liu Jian, China's top government agent who, as the
film opens, has embarked on a top-secret mission in Paris.; As for the vital action and martial arts sequences, the best that can be said 
about them is that they are well-choreographed, and often very violent and 
bloody.","Because the script is lousy.; The only saving grace is
Karyo's ability to turn a very shallow villain into a multi-layered
monster.; I
looked for something else to occupy my attention, but there simply was
nothing else there.; There s not much plot to Dragon, and no suspense.; There's no conviction whatsoever as the
movie barely pays lip service to it; it's only here
because someone apparently thought there should be
some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot."
2164.0,Stargate,1999.0,"Overall, an *excellent* movie, well worth the ticket price,
and one I intend to get as soon as it's available on videotape or in
.MPG format.; This is
one of the most incredible soundtracks that I own.; Musical soundtrack by David Arnold is very good
and it features one of the rare 1990s film themes that
managed to stick in popular memory.; It does a pretty good
job at the hand-waving technobabble that is seemingly so necessary in
science fiction, and resists the temptation to over-explain the
technology.; Once again, a soundtrack has inspired me so much as to buy it.","The script's terrible.; A totally 
ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor, hokey drama, zero logic 
and a crap screenplay.; It's not
a send-up of bad movies -- it IS just a bad movie.; The storyline of this film is completely ludicrous.; Despite the fact that
he is prominently featured in much of the promotional material for the
film, Davidson doesn't even appear until about ninety minutes into the
movie (which runs just under two hours)."
2246.0,Malice,1998.0,"Point one in Malice's favor:  All four of the identified actors
give excellent performances; I was especially impressed with Pullman,
whom I had previously seen only in Mel Brooks's SPACEBALLS.; This is a sharp,
artfully-constructed thriller, a snappy entertainment that does
everything I ask a film in its genre to do:  keep me guessing without
manipulating me.; Yes, there are Hollywood conventions in it, but the movie
also keeps the intelligent viewer in mind.; While never
spectacularly tense, MALICE is always gripping, thanks to a methodical
unfolding of the story with something important happening in almost
every scene.; This movie was very well acted.","5) Why spend thirty minutes on the serial rapist scenes when the only
apparent purpose of said scenes was to establish that Andy was sterile?; Occasionally there's a diamond in the
rough like DEAD AGAIN, but mostly these films are dreary, predictable,
and utterly uninteresting--entirely the opposite of what the word
""thriller"" means.; I found Bebe Neuwirth basically annoying as a police
detective sporting an accent that appeared to be a mutant hybrid of
Boston Brahmin and Brooklyn Italian.; The basic problem with the movie
seems to have been this: The writers wrote half the movie, and then
decided, ""Hey, what if ...?""; Baldwin should stick to roles such as this which require
colossal displays of hubris."
2255.0,Chasing Amy,1998.0,"It is thoughful, honest, superbly funny and heartbreaking.; With CHASING AMY, it's easy to anticipate a certain degree of 
inventive humor, but what's a bit unexpected is the solid drama, 
effective romance, and strong characters.; This movie asked a ton of questions in a very funny way, and I really
enjoyed this aspect of the film.; Smith
manages to create a situation that is both witty and tragic, and quite
believable.; ""Chasing Amy"" is a surprisingly great movie and better than what I expected,
even from Smith.","Reading 'fuck'
over and over again became dull pretty quickly, didn't it?); But the problem with the profanity in
_Chasing Amy_ wasn't that it was shocking, but that it was boring.; Either the characters have
too much to say or nothing at all, but in all cases the outcome of these
slipshod attempts is bad.; Kevin Smith followed his
mini-masterpiece with the abominable ""Mallrats,"" a lewd, crude, off-the-wall
and desperately unfunny comedy with the worst casting in years - Marvel Comics
creator Stan Lee as himself, and actor Michael Rooker, both of whom couldn't
elicit a smile from my lips if they tried.; Profanity is not ordinarily a matter worth mentioning in a review, but
in this case it seems sympomatic of both the good points and bad points
of the film."
2263.0,Music Box,1996.0,"The ending is excellent.; It is excellent and the best
part of the show.; Lange plays that conflict very well.; There are a lot of excellent minor performances, Donald Moffat as
the anti-Semitic father-in-law Harry Talbot, Lukas Haas as the trusting
son Mikey Talbot, and my personal favorite, J. S. Block as Judge
Silver, showing us how a judge in a controversial case should act.; Watch
especially how much energy radiates from his eyes.","For kids younger than that, consider the material
about the crimes in making a judgment, but in no case would I recommend
the movie to kids under 10.; There is no sex, nudity, or
violence, but they talk about some horrific crimes.; And that is
understandable, since the story is predictable.; It looks as if most of the distinguished films of 1989 waited until
year end to be released.; The script by Hollywood's controversial writer Joe Eszterhas is
strictly edge of the seat material."
2277.0,Bicentennial Man,1999.0,"Robin Williams is very funny and touching with some traditional Disney 
tear-jerking scenes.; The
performances are all amiable, the James Horner score is lovely, and the
film is swift, honest and funny with a great majority of it's humor.; Andrew
then embarks on a 200-year quest to discover the nature of humanity,
absorbing lessons on art, freedom, love, and ultimately mortality.; The production values of `Bicentennial Man' are exceptional, with brief
glimpses of our future society presented with great imagination and
impressive special effects.; Andrew, immortal of course, since he wasn't made in Taiwan, 
stays alive throughout; observing a great deal of humanity, absorbing it, and 
becoming more human.","The result is, as you might imagine, primitive, unrealistic
and incredibly disappointing effort.; Director Chris
Columbus, the man responsible for ""Stepmom,"" another horribly
manipulative touchy-feely movie, tries to make Andrew's quest seem
profound, but in Columbus' heavy hands, all the fuss and bother
remains maddeningly pedestrian.; Folks, this was a _bad_ movie.; The machine is supposed to be responsible for housekeeping and
food preparation, but instead shows un-robotic traits like creativity
and a desire to learn.; Oh, who am I kidding?"
2290.0,Jakob the Liar,1979.0,"While all of the actors are perfect in their
roles, the surprise stand-out is Liev Schreiber (Scream 2), who plays
the feisty boxer Mischa with spot-on accuracy.; It's not all about convention, however: we also expect to
appreciate dignity, perseverance, humility, sacrifice, the whole gamut
of things that made us cry at Schindler's List.; While full of mixed
messages and meaty flaws, this film does manage to balance itself quite
admirably - especially with all of the post-Life is Beautiful pressure.; Like Robert Benigni's ""Life is Beautiful,"" Peter Kassovitz's
""Jakob the Liar"" is serio-comic.; It works.","If it is
supposed to be a comedy, it's not a funny one, not even a laughably bad
one.; It is inappropriate, silly, not funny.; With an extremely underdeveloped script by the director, Peter
Kassovitz, the movie has maybe 10 minutes worth of ideas, which after
almost two hours it stretches way beyond the breaking point.; This lack of contrast will only become worse
when it comes to television.; It just sits like a cold, day-old potato pancake."
2291.0,Jacob's Ladder,1965.0,"JACOB'S LADDER needs a little time and space to
develop in its own way and at its own pace, but the Phantom thinks that
phans who see it and are willing to accept its sometimes illogical
twists and turns will be pleasantly surprised.; If The Ladder is real then some
of the future is really happening also.; The structure of Jacob's Ladder is brilliant, though not original.; And although I enjoy the current crop of films that are being
turned out, there hasn't been any film as daring as Jacob's Ladder to do
what it does -- Jacob's Ladder gets into your head, it twists things around
and leaves you reeling.; Jacob's Ladder is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.","Jezebel (Elizabeth Pena) pretty much wears only black, as we might
picture her biblical namesake.; This is an unpleasant and uncomfortable horror film to sit through, be
warned.; Logistical problems include why was he drafted at all, at roughly
twenty-eight (twenty-two after college, plus six years of graduate
school), with a wife and two (or three) kids?; And
by that time the Phantom was not only able to forgive Mr. Lyne for
giving in to convention -- the quaint American cinematic tradition of
supplying a sensible and rational ending to everything -- but also for
directing two of the most awful films of the eighties (the Phantom
wasn't a particular phan of FATAL ATTRACTION, but at least it didn't
provide another nail for the coffin of cinematic intelligence as did his
two prior efforts).; Louie wears white, has a bright, circular light over his shoulder,
and looks like an overgrown cherub."
2292.0,Clerks,1949.0,"This is a film that cost about
$25,000 to make, yet it is much more enjoyable and better written than
most commercial films costing a thousand times as much.; If you can suspend your disbelief and surrender to the feel
of the thing, you will see a very funny, gentle movie played by a
group of perfect slackers.; I still think that ""Clerks"" is truly a landmark of sorts, as it is
somewhat following a trend of telling funny stories about ""nothing"" as
this story is the epitome of that idea and does not become commercial at
all, as it relies upon its originality and comical genius to provide for a
very funny, very entertaining, and very unique film unlike any you will
ever see.; CLERKS is unquestionably uneven, but it is also a very funny wake-up
call to the over-the-counter culture.; CLERKS examines one day in the life of two 22-year-old New Jersey
residents living in the exciting world of retail.","The dialogue is filled with ultra-crude
observations which almost earned CLERKS an NC-17 rating, but they're
caustic and on-target.; Smith, who filmed his low-budget black-and-white feature at the
Quick Stop shop where he worked, set out to make a film with ""no
meaning whatsoever--just a lot of [four-letter word] jokes.""; But for a successful appeal to the MPAA, the movie would have been
released with an NC-17 rating.; Given more money, the director would have preferred a 35 mm color
shoot rather than a blowup of a 16 mm black-and-white print, but the
grainy, occasionally-""homemade"" quality of the movie lends CLERKS a
pseudo-documentary look that a more polished product would not have
achieved.; Like
GO FISH earlier this year, CLERKS is occasionally just a bit too clunky
to be completely endearing."
2293.0,Mallrats,1998.0,"Kevin Smith made an
astonishing splash in 1994 with his hilarious comedy ""Clerks"" - a film made on a
shoestring that has more laughs, insight and sharp one-liners than most
Hollywood comedies about Generation X-ers.; While one
weird occurrence follows another at a rapid pace, the feces one is the
most outrageous (but among the most hilarious).; Newcomer Kevin Smith has once again captured
the spirit of youth by making a funny and wholly original movie that is
virtually without plot, yet is very entertaining and hilarious.; Otherwise, get out there and rent one of the
funniest and best-written films of all time...CLERKS!!!; And of course a
sit-com-esque turn of events that might be a bit cheesy, but is still funny.","The wasted Shannen
Doherty is given nothing to do except smile, yell, and have sex with Jason Lee
in an elevator - Doherty was terrifically funny in ""Heathers"" if anyone cares
about her comic potential.; The film might
have used updated Marx Brothers strategies instead of applying a
para-CLERKS style which relies on frail crutches instead of tempo,
energy or the occasional witticism.; Since those people neither read film
reviews nor put any credence in adult judgments, MALLRATS might just
have a career, even though it is exceptionally thin and dull in every
way.; The movie's comedy is below sitcom level, the dialogue, action and
characters are of no interest, except perhaps to people under twenty
with a mental age under six.; *** (out of 4 = good)
1995, R, 95 minutes [1 hour, 35 minutes]

starring: Jason Lee (Brodie), Jeremy London (T.S."
2294.0,Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,,"Granted, it's not the movie for everyone, but, if you like Kevin Smith's brand
of humor, you'll find that this is his best.; It's bound
to be the funniest movie of the year.; In short, if you like really
raunchy humor, you may find it, as I did, to be the funniest movie of the year.; The polished and at times--brace yourselves--slick visuals of
_Strike_Back_, undoubtedly due in large part to cinematographer Jamie
Anderson, will be downright shocking to Smith fans and especially to his
detractors, who will find themselves with one less thing to knock him on.; Although it's filled with inside jokes, you'll still be laughing even if you
only get some of them.","Unfortunately, it's also shapeless,
pointless and largely unfunny.; Then there's
the humor that's just plain stupid, overdone, and unfunny.; This was supposed
to be the movie that didn't offend anyone, but it's
offensive because it's terrible.; Badly.; Sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the
    film worth watching."
2300.0,Space Jam,1998.0,"Bugs, Daffy, Taz, and friends look better than ever.; Space Jam is a wonderfully entertaining movie that is well suited for both
the adults and the children.; However, this film is funny and enjoyable and I can respect
that.; have
entertained us in the form of animated shorts for years, and this film proves
their gags and routines can still work in the form of feature films.; Other than the lifeless lead and the
little bit of needless bad language, I think the show is good fun, and
I believe your family will too.","Instead it's just a humorless,
overdesigned and underscripted bowl of soggy Wheaties, breakfast of
champions.; He is also virtually the only reason for an adult to
slog through SPACE JAM.; So if you were hoping for either a good movie or one that was so bad it
was good, save your money and see ""The English Patient"" or rent ""Star
Trek V"", respectively.; Rather, they were yanked around by a vacuous script which could only
have been written by a committee of ten year olds.; The style of the staging is straight TV generation garbage: Extreme
angles and manic movement with absolutely no sense of character."
2320.0,Executive Decision,2001.0,"I loved this show, and I think you will too so
I recommend it highly and give it *** 1/2.; Beside what I believe is one of the best performances ever by
Russell, many others are great too.; David Suchet from PBS's Perot
series, is excellent as the leader of the terrorists on the plane.; What a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon!; ""Executive Decision"" is probably the best film Kurt Russell has made
since the original ""Escape From New York.""","No, this is *not* a ""Steven Seagal Movie.""; The problem, and it shouldn't exist, is that
for the entire first *hour* of this film, it is the most hideously boring,
lifeless, repetitive, derivative, and pointless bit of celluloid you can
imagine.; Steven
Seagal has basically a cameo role and disappears early on, never to be
seen again.; Since Steven Seagal is on the marquee, you figure, hey, this
has got to be another Steven Seagal action film, right?; The plot is old (didn't Bruce Willis do this just a year or so ago?"
2323.0,Field of Dreams,1996.0,"Kinsella, the phenomenal success the
film enjoyed was derived from the fact that you didn't have to be a
baseball fan to enjoy it and it appealed to people from all walks of
life.; Summary: The Best Film of the Year (so far) No, I'm not a baseball fan, and yes, maybe this film is a bit too Utopian
for some of you.; Costner gives a quiet, subtle, and moving performance as
a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or
spontaneous in his entire life.; The
film's dreamlike atmosphere and fantasy enhanced theme, displayed in a
perfect flow of emotion from start to finish are symbolic to the very
essence of its genre.; It, for the most part, succeeds in capturing
our emotions and suspending our disbelief.","Rating: low +3.; Then toward the end of the film there is a rather
gratuitous piece of cheap suspense.; It is needed for the larger plot--
almost every shot in this film is--but the actual cause of the suspense
seems forced.; Only the guy from ""thirty-something"" seemed stuck in a rather
deadpan manner as the heavy, but that's really having to scratch at the dirt
for criticisms.; I don't buy that."
2348.0,Holy Matrimony,2000.0,"Havana, who took
great pains to adapt her worldly ways to simple Hutterite
lifestyle, is desperate.; This interesting mix of GETTING EVEN WITH
DAD and WITNESS had more in it than simple ""high concept"" -
story and characters offered numerous opportunities for
humour based on cultural, generational and gender gaps, all
wrapped in neat feelgood package of family entertainment.; Acting was good -
Patricia Arquette didn't seem tired from another role of
fugitive (she had played similar characters in TROUBLEBOUND
and TRUE ROMANCE in previous years) while young
Gordon-Levitt showed that even the children who lack
Culkin's cuteness might carry the film.; Community elders see this as formality but Havana,
at the surprise of everyone, accepts to marry Peter's
12-year old brother Zeke (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitate).; Unfortunately, while
Nimoy wisely decided not to take sides in Hutterite vs.
outside world conflict (even when their strict obedience of
biblical laws led to unpleasant results like institutional
paedophilia), he nevertheless missed opportunity to give
more insight into Hutterite world, their lifestyles and
worldviews.","The film also suffered from bad pacing,
unnecessary subplot involving maniacal FBI agent and weak
and not very believable happy ending.; However, the obscure biblical
custom would rescue her plans - according to Hutterite
tradition, widow must be proposed by the deceased's younger
brother.; David Weisberg's script for HOLY MATRIMONY probably looked
great on paper.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
2360.0,Saving Grace,2000.0,"It's all about the pluck and
determination of post-War Britain -- the Britain that remembers how
important it is to get along and just be nice.; It also maintains a streak of small Brit films that, like
Waking Ned Devine and The Full Monty, are gangbusters comedy and sweet
as fine chocolate.; Still, there are enough bright moments, a generous dose of 
laughs, and some perfectly-timed one-liners to compensate for what is 
essentially a wittier take on Cheech and Chong.; It's the
Quirky British Village That Comes Together genre.; This leads to the 
film's funniest surprise where the greenhouse is lit with dozens of bright 
lamps each night, leaving an ethereal glow in the sky that keeps the 
villagers entertained in anticipation.","Such
carelessness should be enough to sink a frothy enterprise like SAVING
GRACE, but somehow it doesn't quite.; But SAVING GRACE doesn't bother with
developing its characters.; It's barely fun in real life, unless you're participating in the
shenanigans.; How does one reconcile 90 minutes of
grins with the nagging impression that the script was in some ways
terribly sloppy?; It all begins to seem like little more
than an excuse on which to hang a bunch of jokes about giggle fits."
2614.0,Innerspace,1998.0,"The sneak preview audience I was in thoroughly enjoyed it.; The mood is
definitely light and there are numerous well-done sight gags (though at times
the humor gets a little silly).; INNERSPACE takes the elements of a typical adventure thriller, adds some
snappy dialogue and good special effects, and skillfully creates a very
entertaining movie.; The film is packed.; Capsule review:  FANTASTIC VOYAGE crossed with FOUL PLAY
     makes for another science fiction comedy cut from the same
     mold as BACK TO THE FUTURE.","We encounter every dumb, stupid cliche in the book.; The
story involves a top-secret military project to inject a miniaturized pilot and
his high-tech submarine into the blood stream of a rabbit.; A scientist flees with the miniaturized sub in a
syringe, and injects it into a unsuspecting nerdy pedestrian in a nearby
shopping mall.; Putter, with the help of Tuck's reporter girlfriend, must recover the
stolen microchip needed to reenlarge Tuck, before Tuck's air supply runs out.; Pendleton's abilities to enhance Putter's own powers start impressive
and eventually get absurd, while the characters are really only
superficially developed and at times are totally absurd."
2621.0,Return to Me,1984.0,"Driver is an excellent actress, Duchovny is also
charming with his subtle emotionalism, and director/actress/writer Bonnie
Hunt delivers a strong performance as Minnie's best friend.; Performances from Robert Loggia and Jim Belushi
are endearing and enjoyable, and director Bonnie Hunt gives a strong
performance as Grace's supportive friend, Megan.; The romance of this picture is fun and believable.; Although it's rare to
see him in a movie that premieres in a theater, Belushi delivers his lines with
great comic skill.; Set in Chicago, the film begins as Bob and Liz Rueland (David Duchovny, Joely 
Richardson), a happily married couple, are attending a fundraising event for 
the Lincoln Park Zoo, where Liz, who has a great love and compassion for 
animals, works.","Boring.; This can't be remake of something that you saw decades
ago because the kickoff point for the plot concerns a medical procedure
(heart transplant) that hasn't been around very long.; The real problem here seems to
be lack of directorial focus.; Not a horrible movie, but not a good one either.; Then again, I can't honestly admire him for choosing to
take on this sappy, predictable and ultimately, boring role."
2639.0,Deconstructing Harry,1950.0,"The depth of the film is also wonderfully accentuated with Allen's
brilliant diretion.; All the actors, who mostly have brief cameos in stories, are wonderful
(though Judy Davis does go a bit overboard), with stand-out performances
going to Elisabeth Shue, Billy Crystal (who's brilliant as the devil),
Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Richard Benjamin, Kirstie Alley, Demi Moore
(there's a shock), and, of course, Woody, who gives one of his best
performances in years.; ""Deconstructing Harry"" is one of the freshest, funniest, and all-around
fascinating films I've seen this year.; This may be Woody's angriest and narcississtic film
in years, which may turn off a lot of people, but it's still brilliant
work from an ingenius film craftsman.; By turns
clever, devestating, bitter and delightful, this challenging piece of work
is easily one of Allen's most mature efforts to date.","The first
fifteen minutes of this film, for example, are quite repulsive and almost
unbearably tedious; the people sitting behind me were considering walking out,
and while it does get somewhat better after that, I can't say I would have
blamed them.; Of course, well-presented boredom is not much
better than mediocre boredom is it?; Of course, well-presented boredom is not much
better than mediocre boredom is it?; This does not make the film bad in and of
itself, but somehow it just doesn't carry enough impact to justify asking the
audience to swallow such a large amount of obnoxious behavior.; Even with the same script, it could easily have
been downright awful."
2640.0,Heathers,1996.0,"It's satire -- mean-spirited, nasty, cunning
satire, which is of course the best and most honest kind.; The whole cast is good, adding to the characterizations of an excellent
script with expansive performances.; Nevertheless, HEATHERS
deserves applause for taking risks and daring to be different.; And just when her admiration for the Heathers turns to
contempt, Veronica meets J.D., played by Christian Slater who gives a
delicious Jack Nicholsonesque performance as the mysterious, rebellious,
and demented new kid at school.; Daniel
Waters' script is full of hysterical dialogue and great one-liners, and the
teenage slang he creates for the movie is a riot.","I felt it was just slapped in
with no consideration for those watching the film.; Potentially offensive subject matter is defused right from film's
opening - if you're willing to believe that three girls all
coincidentally named Heather are running their campus then you'll go
along with the notion of death as just another cruel high school
prank.; Winona Ryder's character is
not the brightest person.; Well,
you'd probably call it sick, demented, and perverse.; This I feel really
hurt the film, and I wish that somebody had tried harder to make the
ending better."
2666.0,Dark City,1998.0,"It may not be the best film of the year, but Dark City is
worth watching, and is ultimately just good fun.; Dark City is a great visionary achievement, a film so original and
exciting, it stirred my imagination like no movie has in a long time.; DARK CITY has a top-notch cast, with zany characters and
terrific performances all-around.; The film flowed beautifully.; However,
unlike most ambiguous and surreal movies, such as Lynch's Lost Highway, it
gives you answers in a way that you can understand.","The problem with the script is that it tries overly hard
to explain every idea introduced and leaves nothing for the audience to
think about.; Oh, one thing they might have done, which would've been cute, would've
been to put a couple pair of elephants standing on a big turtle in a
particular scene.; The writers, whether through a failure
of talent or through a cave-in to a producer's low opinion of the
audience, try to explain everything in agonizing, repetitive detail,
far worse than ""Blade Runner"" with the voice-over.; It's clumsy, stupid, and in the end, just
boring.; The acting is bland, and since there is virtually no character
development no one seems to care."
2668.0,Sleepy Hollow,1997.0,"He did a great job with shadowing and in the end it's very surprising and
satisfying.; He did a great job with shadowing and in the end it's very surprising and
satisfying.; The gothic village itself
has a wonderfully eerie feel.; Excellent job!; Perfectly matching the spirit of
the film is a terrific Michael Gambon.","* - One of the worst movies ever made.; 'Batman Returns' in 1992
was a silly, repetitive and nasty assault on our senses with horrible
villains, an incoherent script and some very bad overlapping on the part of
Burton's direction.; Sleepy Hollow has some unique features, but the script is a terrible mess.; * * - Pretty bad.; It just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big
blockbuster."
2731.0,Indochine,1987.0,"INDOCHINE is intelligent and entertaining, certainly one of the best
films of 1992.; It is an excellent film, very well carried out from beginning to end, and
although it is rather slow in parts, it only adds to the need to see it
resolved.; She is ideal for the part of Eliane -- mature,
sensuous, in control, strong, and deeply loving, deeply sad.; As I say this is
really my only criticism.; I highly recommend INDOCHINE to you, even at full ticket price.","He is not working with an established literary
property, for one thing, and so lacks some of the structure and
direction of the Hollywood models.; I do have one rather large cavil: there is no reference to World
War II anywhere in the film.; In one scene a
group of farmers is destroying a whole family and their belongings by taking
back the land they deserve, rather than be owned by others.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
2742.0,Naked Lunch,1994.0,"An excellent job.; We feel
that we have entered an incredible moving painting: a true motion
picture.; A top-flight cast of supporting actors turn
in strange and excellent performances as Weller's friends, his wife,
and his acquaintances in the Interzone.; Do
see NAKED LUNCH, if you're not easily offended; it is an entertaining
film, and it breaks enough rules to put the rest of cinema in a
different light.; A fine cast, all in all.","Or is most of
the action a hallucination?; Not much.; On a
scale of zero to five, I give NAKED LUNCH a three.; Either way, stay away from Naked Lunch.; The
agent-runner is a giant bug, a roach as big as a Compaq, brought to life
by the director's vile imaginings (as an oblique reference to
Cronenburg's earlier hit, THE FLY?)"
2758.0,Addams Family Values,2000.0,"Raul
Julia and Anjelica Huston are as perfect as last time.; Joan
Cusack is wonderfully over-the-top as Debbie the psycho nanny, with her
primary functions being to snarl lines and expose cleavage.; It was high-spirited and gleefully performed.; Still, when it is just showing little vignettes that could have come
from Addams cartoons, it is terrific.; This is a film with big ups and
big downs so overall it gets just a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.","A few sparkling performances and
funny moments save this from being a waste of time, but it's not a
promising way to start the Thanksgiving/Christmas movie season.; It
simply exhausted its premise after about fifteen minutes.; There are laughs to be had along the way, but not enough to cover up
the obvious lack of plot.; in the household, because neither of
the previous Addams children likes their new baby brother, and they
spend hours devising ways to get rid of him.; The Pubert plot is basically an
excuse for a series of elaborate attempts by Wednesday and Pugsley to
do away with the baby, and later for some ""normal baby"" jokes."
2770.0,American Pie 2,1999.0,"Pie 2 is essentially built around five set pieces that
are very funny and extremely well-executed.; To a large 
extent, the best ingredients of the original ""Pie"" shine here as well: 
Biggs is fine as hapless Jim, Eugene Levy is terrific as his 
well-intentioned father, and Hannigan sparkles as sexually deviant flutist 
Michelle.; Wells story, the one used in
Orson Welles' infamous radio play of 1938 that scared the world.; The film's climax occurs as Los Angeles is being attacked and the evacuation of
the city causes a great panic.; Times may change; people may change.","And, once again, Nicholas and Reid are forgettable as former 
couple Kevin and Vicky, and Natasha Lyonne's Jessica is given nothing to 
do.; The acting was wooden, the romance
was blah, and the religious messages tacked on were pathetic.; They are nothing more than potential recipients of
over-active, raging hormones.; Aside from the strong
performance by Jason Biggs, the three other main characters were so
painfully bland, they could be described as The Guy Who Acts Like He's 40
(Eddie Kaye Thomas), The Guy Who Acts Like He's Retarded (Chris Klein) and
The Guy Who May As Well Not Even Be There (Thomas Ian Nicholas).; Rated R.  Running time: 100 minutes."
2778.0,Clifford,1972.0,":-)) A host of problems conspire against CLIFFORD.; Or, in this case, 75 minutes long.; Easy, right?; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","The
script also sets up a host of absurd situations--from the awful
framing device to a super-stupid ""Dinosaurland"" climax that isn't even
a JURASSIC PARK slam because CLIFFORD was filmed *before* RAPTOR'S
LIST.; Frankly, it's like watching a bad SCTV or SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE skit gone long.; Charles Groden has done better comedy--even opposite enormous
dogs that get named after deaf composers and, somehow, find their way
on stage during boring Academy Award ceremonies.; 90 minutes Martin Short as a troublesome ten-year-old.; Picture Martin Short, standing small and wearing knee pants,
nagging Charles Grodin in scene after scene after scene until the
expected blow-up and resulting comeuppance."
2898.0,As Good As It Gets,1998.0,"As Good As It Gets is a wonderful ""feel good"" movie.; Writer and director James L. Brooks, who has blessed us with
several wonderful films including TERMS OF ENDEARMENT and one of my all
time favorite movies, BROADCAST NEWS, gives the world a present this
Christmas called AS GOOD AS IT GETS.; He also makes
a human out of him, and gives one of the best performances of the year.; Nicholson's back in ""As Good As It Gets,"" and he's as great as
he gets.; With Jack Nicholson in his
classic role as a highly-strung urbanite and Helen Hunt as
Carol Connelly, the woman who makes a mensch out of him,
""As Good As It Gets"" is perhaps the year's smartest comedy.","It's a painful scene to watch, sloppily giving the audience an excuse to
pity poor Melvin.; Without
him, Melvin would not have been Melvin, and the movie very likely could be
less than mediocre.; If you believe Melvin has changed or if anything is supposed to happen
that is for the better in his character, then I guess you believe
something I didn't, or couldn't, or rather, I didn't care if  I believed
it or not, since I sauced it out, real pronto, within the first five
minutes of this flick, that the story didn't matter much, this was a
cosmetic psychological rendering to a situation that could be real, but
that this film was not about real internal changes, but about creating a
slickness about its characterizations of people so the audience could
have enough laughs at Melvin's insensitivity to others and be diverted
by that, and walk out of the theater happy to believe that Melvin wasn't
so bad a guy after all.; On top of that, Nicholson mellowed far
too quickly for my liking.; Melvin
(Nicholson) is the overly-obnoxious and obsessively-compulsive writer."
2928.0,Michael,1997.0,"While this may not be quite as sweet as THE 
PREACHER'S WIFE, the central theme of redemption is essentially the 
same.; One thing or another kept me from seeing 'Michael' around the hoidays and
after finally getting around to see it I was pleasantly surprised.; Her voice and facial expressions as she delivers the 
song's clunky, but true, lyrics provide one of the most graceful and 
elegant moments in the movie.; Fortunately, mainly on the strength of
Travolta's on-screen charm and humor, ""Michael"" is a good-natured,
rambling little film that has its heart in the right place, even
though its point is muddled.; In his
room, Frank reflects to Dorothy, ""It is definitely the weirdest thing
I've ever seen.","Ultimately, it's neither offensive nor 
horrible; it's just another unspectacular, uninspired entry on Nora 
Ephron's erratic resume.; The
dialogue is dull, dull, dull,  uinteresting and unwitty.; The main trouble with this movie is a boring, four-writer script which
illustrates the saying ""A camel is a horse built by a committee.""; The plot is thin and 
predictable.; After the natural conclusion point, there is
another ten minutes of uninteresting ""resolution."""
2976.0,Hairspray,2000.0,"It's perfect.; It's not
just entertaining, it's actually very touching.; I've watched it four times and I
still find it one of the most genuinely uplifting films I've seen.; This affectionate, funny tribute to teenage life in early-60's
Baltimore has such an innocent feel-good vibe that fans of Waters'
earlier trash classics may, ironically, be a little shocked.; Immediately you see - no, feel - the difference
between the black and white styles as Waters charges the scene with an
incredible sensuality and sexual energy.","Waters's films are mostly about bad taste.; I mean
there isn't a character out of place anywhere.; Hysterical racist housewife to funky black lady in downtown record
shop:  ""Don't you try your voodoo spells on me you...you...NATIVE
WOMAN!!!!""; Some (Some?; that most of his viewing audience considers to be a joke."
2990.0,Pacific Heights,2000.0,"Carter does not just know his
legal rights as a tenant; he understands how to use those rights in
intelligent and creative ways to grind up and swallow his unsuspecting
landlords.; Keaton, playing a frighteningly sinister
sociopath, holds up his end of the deal with a penetrating performance.; The screenplay is Daniel
Pyne's first and is inspired by his own experience as a landlord.; Patty Palmer and Drake Goodman (played by Melanie Griffith and Matthew
Modine) are two young people starting out life together buying a house and
renting out the first floor as apartments.; Law favors the tenant.","PACIFIC HEIGHTS is a
resounding disappointment.; With PACIFIC HEIGHTS, screenwriter Daniel Pyne has shot himself in
the foot by destroying a promising premise with two frustratingly idiotic
characters.; He doesn't receive any help from Pyne's
hopelessly inept screenplay.; Curiously, his screenplay starts
faltering only when he stops grinding it.; Guilty of excessively self-conscious direction, director John Schlesinger
lets the movie slip away from him."

performance may not be perfect, but it's still the best thing about GODS
AND MONSTERS.; Based on Christopher Bram's novel, written and lovingly directed by Bill
Condon, the film touches us with its honest and poignant portrayal of a
fascinating individual.; But thanks to Ian McKellen, it's
still worth seeing.; His work
in this film is brilliant because of the way he UNDER plays the role.; McKellen, white-haired and polished, and Boone, blockheaded but
surprisingly intelligent and understanding, share a very complex
relationship that is the heart and major strength of the film.","The real problem with the film is that it just isn't very engaging.; After two hours, the
device has grown stale and predictable.; He says,
for example, that Boris Karloff was a proper English actor but was
dreadfully dull.; The rest of the picture is too stilted and dry; moments that require some sense
of movement are too inert.; According to this movie, nothing at all."
3049.0,Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,1974.0,"My son Jeffrey, age 8 1/2, said he really liked it and especially
thought Ace was funny.; In
ACE VENTURA, Jim Carrey establishes himself as a first-rate screen
clown, one I hope to see again.; As proof of how good Carrey can be, consider
his relatively more restrained performances in LIAR, LIAR and THE MASK.; Jim Carrey is one of the most talented comic actors of our
time, but his reputation often suffered because of the
critics' snobbery.; Like the other movies loosely grouped in this category (which
include the two WAYNE'S WORLDs and, to a lesser extent, the NAKED
GUN-type flicks), the humor is very much of the hit-or-miss variety.","It just wouldn't work.; The script is devoid of ideas, and the movie plays as if it were
one long ad lib routine by Carrey.; Director:  Tom Shadyac.; However, stretching things beyond a certain
point courts disappointment.; For just about everyone else, this is
likely to be far too much of something best taken in small doses."
3050.0,Doctor Dolittle,1995.0,"Yes they generate great one liners, with style and
human expression thanks to Jim Henson and co.; It's filled with laughs and it's entertaining.; But for those of us who enjoy a 
well-executed crude chuckle, this ""Dolittle"" achieves a lowbrow high 
unheard of since Murphy's own ""The Nutty Professor.""; There's a certain timing that's mandatory in comedy.; But John Leguizamo, Albert Brooks, Gary Shandling, Julie Kavner, Gilbert
Gottfried and others lend their pipes as well.","And they're not
'funny' dumb, like Dumb & Dumber (1994), but just boring dumb.; And, the movie just isn't all that interesting.; Poor old Murphy looks bored stiff
throughout the whole movie, and his performance suffers.; Sadly, he's barely
in the movie, and Rock's really annoying Hamster is given far too much
screen time.; Murphy does a charming job, but he just doesn't have enough material to
work with here."
3056.0,Frankenstein,1999.0,"Cleese gives
a surprisingly effective, purely dramatic performance as Professor
Waldman.; The music
contributes a great deal to the power of some of the key scenes.; It is another
courageous and fascinating performance by one of the most daring actors
of our time.; Although the film is not perfect (the camera that simply refuses to stay
still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than
effective), these minor faults are easily forgivable, as the picture is
otherwise captivating and stimulating.; Branagh has probably created one of
the best (if not the best) adaptions of Shelly's classic novel.","Then, the  problem might arise that this story would be over
three
hours long.; There is
too little of this, however, and what little there is is badly used:
one's attention and sympathies soon start to wander, as both
characterisation and the episodic plot are poorly developed.; The opening sequence, which takes place on a
ship in the Arctic, is so loud and fast that it borders on the
incoherent; the next twenty minutes are a crashing bore.; People looking for excitement on the screen and
people who wanted to see Shelley's novel accurately done will probably
agree that this movie is just okay, but nothing great.; With appropriate tweaks to the original story--such as electric
eels as energy sources--there should be enough scares here to spook
anyone."
3064.0,Chances Are,1996.0,"The light supernatural comedy-fantasy has been around for a long time,
having its greatest flourish in the late 1930s and early 1940s with the film
versions of Thorne Smith's books, particularly the ""Topper"" series and
TURNABOUT.; CHANCES ARE is a spirited and good natured
romantic comedy in the tradition of BACK TO THE FUTURE and PEGGY SUE GOT
MARRIED.; While
dining with these new acquaintances, Alex experiences the startling
revelation that he is Corinne's late husband, Louie--or at least he was in
his past life.; Given its outlandish premise, CHANCES ARE is a surprisingly good
film.; I think this works by contrast
to Robert Downey, Jr., who is not yet an accomplished actor by anybody's
definition.","The movie is utterly
predictable, and it fails to leave a lasting impression.; Much to my delight,
however, I was dead wrong.; The movie's premise is merely a vehicle
for developing intriguing relationships between sympathetic characters.; Previously having shown
himself to be a quick thinker, it is unlikely that he would so totally go
incoherent without ever asking himself, ""How must this behavior look to
other people?""; When he first realizes the
joke that fate has played on him, Alex completely loses all his self-control
in a way that seems totally out of character."
3172.0,Bandits,1999.0,"The plan works so well as Joe and Terry rob their way from Oregon to
L.A. (en route to open a nightclub in Mexico, of course!); Filming in the American northwest gives
the movie a different look than most Hollywood offerings.; Music by Christopher Young.; She hooks up with the
boys as they continue robbing their way down the West Coast, from Oregon
towards California.; The plan works like a charm and the duo gains fame as ""The Sleepover
Bandits.""","Instead, Bandits is a messy
debacle of awful jokes, unbelievable romance, and a ploddingly obvious
storyline that feels even longer than its two-plus hours.; Too bad that's 30 minutes into the
picture -- and the film just heads south from there.; But while
details like logic are glossed over, increasingly irrelevant director
Barry Levinson (Sphere, An Everlasting Piece, you get the picture...)
opts to spend long, pregnant moments developing irrelevant,
uninteresting storylines, the end result being one awfully boring movie.; You
could do a lot worse than ""Bandits,"" but the filmmakers could have done
much better.; There's probably not a whole lot wrong with ""Bandits"" that a
decent *director* couldn't fix."
3512.0,Under Siege 2: Dark Territory,1938.0,"Hilarious.; Hilarious.; Though not as good as the first, Under Siege 2:Dark Territory is inevitably
fun.; This is a very
thematic score and works well with the film.; He knows many ways to inflict pain to bad guys, and he
shows us many.","They're 
boring.; I have come to the conclusion that it's impossible for a Steven 
Segal movie to be anything better than mediocre, and this particular 
travesty may be his worst yet.; Eric Bogosian as the crazed villain, Dane,
doesn't come close to Tommy Lee Jone's crazed villain in the first film.; As a villain, Eric Bogosian lacks a certain panache.; It's hard to force myself to watch Steven Seagal movies."
3513.0,Legionnaire,1998.0,"The theme is the French Foreign Legion', meaning
brown uniforms and LOTS of marching.; It is very reminiscent of older war
epics like Khartoum'.; The focus in this
movie is on boxing, shooting, comradeship, desert, forlorn love rather
than martial arts.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","If this movie was
intended to capture a Lawrence of Arabia' feel about it, it fails in
the area of cinematography, the sand isn't as white, the kurds not very
menacing (except for blowing up a fort and dragging a man across sand)
and Van Damme is not romance personified.; Directed by Peter MacDonald
Writing credits: Sheldon Lettich, Rebecca Morrison
Cast: Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Berkoff, Ana Sotrenovic This movie is one in a long line of Jean-Claude Van Damme action flics
which unfortunately, hasn't reached any pinnacle.; The ending is abrupt and leaves the viewer wandering whether
they ran out of footage or budget and is the film's weakest point.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
3558.0,"Girl, Interrupted",1996.0,"And even when you
know what's going to emerge from the corner, when you know exactly
what will happen, you feel surprised, amazed and moved.; In contrast, Ryder is subtle and quiet, but all the 
more genuinely real because of it, and the internal conflicts you sense she 
is going through are something many teenagers and twentysomethings will be 
able to identify with.; But for those who
enjoy a good cry, this is the perfect choice.; The performances are excellent.; Ryder is very good.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; And this is a disappointing effort.; * * - Pretty bad.; This is more like
a watered down version of ""Cuckoo's Nest,"" and far too bland to
inspire much interest.; Acting is the only thing that remains constant during
these 127 minutes."
3587.0,Bogus,2000.0,"In BOGUS, there is a scene in which the Jimmy
Stewart classic HARVEY is showing on a television, and the reference makes
you suspect that someone went into a pitch meeting to describe BOGUS as
""HARVEY, but you can see the rabbit...and he's Gerard Depardieu.""; With 
a director like Norman Jewison (MOONSTRUCK) at the helm, it shouldn't be 
a surprise that BOGUS is well-realized and thoughtful, but, given the 
number of movies that have gone wrong over the last few months, it's 
refreshing to see something that lives up to its promise.; Albert is frightened and
doesnt want to go, but finds an imaginary friend, Bogus (Gerard
Depardieu) to help him on his way.; BOGUS is a well-crafted and moving motion picture.; Starring:  Whoopi Goldberg, Gerard Depardieu, Haley Joel Osment.","Worst of
all is Whoopi's characterization.; Instead, poster-driven film-making has turned out yet another
promising but disappointing effort.; Too bad.; That role, unfortunately, is the real problem with BOGUS, because
someone should have realized that its central conceit was a big mistake.; Since Albert is white and Harriet is black, this might
cause some challenges to be dealt with, but this script pays the issue
scant attention."
3597.0,I Know What You Did Last Summer,1947.0,"But is also a lot of fun.; * * * * - Great flick.; Sarah Michelle Gellar, from TV's highly          
entertaining Buffy the Vampire Slayer, has a terrific screen
presence and is a star in the making.; One of these students is Helen Shivers (Sarah Michelle
Gellar), whose answer to her question is a very funny spoof of beauty
pageants.; * * * * * - One of the greatest movies ever, see it now.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; * * - Pretty bad.; The actors are bland and forgettable (save for the cute-as-a-button Hewitt),
the scares are predictable, the dialogue is sheer rubbish, and of course, there
is a door left open for a sequel.; It's just not as fun as Scream was and at points it's just not fun at all.; These are the
films which you almost want to laugh at because the writing is bad, or
the acting sucks."
3600.0,I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,1989.0,"This time around, you're
going to be surprised by the identity of the second killer in a
movie with a good deal of humor supplied by Mekhi Phifer,
whose idea of action has nothing to do with the fisherman's
agenda and with special joie de vivre by Brandy Norwood as
the excitable gal who may not know the capital of Brazil but
who is so charming that the radio d.j.; Of course the other obvious flaw
in the title of this little gem is the fact that the events referred to in
the title actually happened two summers before this film takes place.; The scariest movies I've seen leave
everything up to the imagination:  Seven and The Shining qualify as
truly frightening films, because they have a level of humanity that the
typical teen-slasher ignores completely.; Like the previous blockbuster, ""I Still Know..."" follows the
usual conventions of the horror genre, playing up the false
alarms in the opening scenes while piling stress upon tension
the closer it approaches its climax.; His ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on
all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers,
and I think ""I Still Know"" has really suffered by not having him on board.","Boring!; Not unless you want to
see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90
minutes.; Though
it wouldn't take much to improve quality over the first, Callaway
doesn't give it any effort, turning in a script that lacks any spark of
originality and wit.; At
least the cast looks good (presumably their only qualification)...but
you wonder why the four of them can't take on the feeble old Ben
Willis.; The acting is very bad."
4011.0,Beetlejuice,1993.0,"Nevertheless, I definitely recommend this
one.; BEETLEJUICE is a surprisingly enjoyable flick.; Beetlejuice isn't a perfect movie--but it's an entertaining one.; I love this movie.; He is brilliant.","Why is BEETLEJUICE so
forgettable?; Alec Baldwin is
forgettable as her husband.; Gasp as Baldwin runs around with
no head!; It's
uneven and poorly maintained and badly edited and the main character (
Beetlejuice played by Michael Keaton ) should have been completely rooted
out.; I just saw BEETLEJUICE, an extremely forgettable
fantasy film."
4133.0,Blow,1999.0,"Depp is very good and Liotta
provides welcome support as the loving, nonjudgmental papa.; Does this movie still give us a
great story, an intriguing lead character, an amazing soundtrack, plenty of
style, many a touching moment and an altogether fascinating cinematic
journey?; Though I had never heard of George Jung, known as the
most successful smuggler of cocaine into the U.S. ever
(having brought in a whopping eighty-five percent of the coke
enjoyed first by the beautiful people and then by partygoers
and addicts alike), Ted Demme's down-to-earth brand of
filmmaking shows us step by step how he rose to the top of
the white-powder kingdom.; Kudos to Ted Demme for taking the material and turning into an entertaining
and touching vehicle, and to Johnny Depp for keeping me glued to the screen
with yet another solid performance.; Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths are poignant as Jung's troubled parents.","If
cocaine was not the subject matter, this film would be boring (and it
probably wouldn't have been made).; But the biggest
bust about ""Blow,"" is that it's just not a good film to get off on.; Playing 
an obnoxious woman who quickly becomes George's loud-mouthed cokehead of 
wife, she looks wonderful while trying to act and look bad.; There was not much else to get off on, as ""Blow"" didn't have the script
or the kind of direction needed to blow one away.; Too bad that the hyperambitious but predictably formulaic script by Nick Cassavetes and David McKenna is clich=E9-riddled and fragmented in its condensation of Bruce Porter's book and that director Ted Demme relies so much on Depp's voice-over narration as the third-act disintegrates into a banal morality morass."
4154.0,Three Seasons,1987.0,"Tony Bui has handcrafted a flawless masterpiece; a gem that deserves
much more than its 3 Sundance Film Festival awards.; The direction all through out is
so clean and well done, using different styles for each story, to create a
wonderful tapestry that is rare in many films.; It is such a sweet, quiet performance, but it is one that,
like the rest of the film, is subtly heartbreaking.; Richard Horowitz's music beautifully complements the
evocative visuals, adding to the film's haunting quality.; The
movie is filled with a sense of despair and loss, but it also
resonates with a spirit of optimism and a very real humanity.","His face, and no doubt
his body, are terribly disfigured.; It
lacks what it thinks it has: poetic vision.; The
production notes state that the censors followed the
filmmakers around and scrutinized every foot of celluloid,
refusing to allow a discarded meat bun to pass muster while
feeling perfectly at ease with the peregrinations of a smart-
looking, well-dressed hooker.; When presenting a story with such weighty themes, a weak film will get
bogged down by melodrama.; It is very difficult to tell stories of any real plot complexity
in a film that is going to tell four stories in as little as 110
minutes."
4232.0,Scream,1991.0,"""Scream"", directed by
horror master Wes Craven, makes a refreshing twist by poking fun at the
genre Craven's worked with so much in previous years.; It's very good.; It is extremely refreshing to see a movie like this; a fun, scary, well
executed (no pun intended) and incredibly enjoyable slasher flick.; This is what everyone's been waiting for, a movie that's funny, scary,
brilliant, and has a message at the same time.; This translates into a lot
of fun.","After
NIGHTMARE, Craven went on to make a string of muddled and disappointing
movies -- DEADLY FRIEND and SHOCKER stand out as two of the worst.; interest in horror movies
-- a waning genre since the 80s, poisoned by endless and lame sequels and
hordes of uninteresting ripoffs.; Only so rarely do I ever even rent a horror movie, I'm just not that big
into them.; It's just a stupid movie.; In addition, ironically the
movie falls much into the same cliches of many horror movies - the victims
and cops are just too stupid and the murderer is just too smart."
4233.0,Scream 2,1988.0,"Scream 2 is definitely the best horror film
you will see this year.; All criticism aside, Scream 2 is an entertaining movie.; Jamie
Kennedy provides one of the most shocking moments in the film, and
also some of the funniest lines (""Showgirls,"" his response to what he
thinks is the scariest film he's ever seen).; Craven's camera work in the 
segment is exceptional, reminiscent of the best classic horror films.; Neve Campbell again stars as Sidney, and she does a great
job.","Aside from her bad traits,
she basically *had* no personality, leaving us a female lead who was
essentially an obnoxious and annoying little bitch/slut.; As a mystery, it tries way, way, _way_ too
hard.; SCREAM 2 has got the worst case of

bad) movie called ""Stab.""; premise), but it just doesn't live up to the first."
4234.0,Scream 3,1983.0,"The way 
each of the surviving characters' lives receive closure is an excellent 
touch, and the final few shots are filled with subtle, yet remarkable power.; As a trilogy, ""Scream"" was a lot of
fun; refreshing, humorous, offbeat.; It was so simple, yet so
perfect.; And though it's not a perfect film that anyone will remember
after a week, it is a worthy, graceful (and hopefully final) addition
to the 'Scream Trilogy'.; This is some of Posey's best work yet, and certainly her best in a
mainstream film.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; * * - Pretty bad.; There are too many characters, too many red herrings and
the finale is a disappointment.; It lacks a freshness.; Unfortunately, the 
idea was copied, and quickly became a cliché in itself."
4242.0,Scary Movie,1974.0,"Kurt Fuller adopts a riotous
deadpan as the local sheriff (at a press conference, he solemnly intones
""The killing of these teenagers is tragic, but, you know, shit happens"") and
Anna Faris, in the Neve Campbell spot, creates the film's most well rounded
character.; It's tight, it's outrageous and it's definitely not for small kids.; The free flow of imaginative humor is evident here as the actors 
give their own personalities to their roles.; The most memorable scenes from both movies get spoofed here, along
with loads of other films, including ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Usual
Suspects.""; It's also the funniest thing I've seen
since the Farrelly brothers' ""There's Something About Mary.""","Being somehow provoked by this movie is completely
unnecessary.; Scary Movie was directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (A Lowdown Dirty Shame)
and its script was cobbled together by no less than six screenwriters.; There's not much point to discussing the plot of Scary Movie (mercifully
renamed from Scream If You Know What I Did Last Halloween).; As usual with this genre,
there's no story; the Wayanses simply pummel the audience with gag after
gag.; Make no mistake, ""Scary Movie"" is
unbelievably gross and juvenile."
4247.0,Scary Movie,1999.0,"It's a gem, a small treasure, a bit tarnished as well as ribald,
scatological and unrefined.; Inventive fun.; It's far from being a perfect film, but I could definatly 
watch it over and over and laugh each time at something new and funny.; The cast plays the film out very well with Shannon Elizabeth the standout.; Spoofs have always been a favorite of mine in the movie genre.","Imagine the shame of that poor animal in the picture with lipstick
on his face.; It starts off with funny material but then quickly
spirals downward as it becomes mired in unfunny
gross-out gags, jokes that are insulting rather than
irreverent, and a lineup of skits that strains for
laughs but instead is greeted by heads nodding in
disappointment.; SCARY
MOVIE's problem isn't that it tries to do things SCREAM already did
better, but that it's not funny enough often enough.; However, 
none of that really matters, because ""Scary Movie"" is intended for adults.; Since ""Scary Movie"" is nothing more than a silly
spoof, it would be unfair to measure it against the
same standards as you would any other kind of film."

it's lampooning.; Scary Movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor, and it is not
because the Wayans brothers, Shawn and Marlon doing the writing and Keenen Ivory
behind the camera, don't try.; It could have been worse.; Scary Movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another, offering weak
spoofs of that Nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball,

invigorating action scenes, no reason at all to waste your time except
to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting
players."

Bancroft is perfect in the role of the steadfast, political piranha
Senator, and Viggo Mortensen draws a wonderful performance as the
""hard-as-nails"" Major Chief.; Jane'' is first and foremost a star vehicle and,
thanks to Moore's astounding chutzpah, it's an entertaining one.; However, Moore could not have been more perfectly cast as the
strong-willed heroine in Ridley Scott's surprisingly effective G.I.; I noted that that scene is the perfect climax for G.I.","JANE isn't

the thematic depth that the film makers would like to attribute to it."
4478.0,Indecent Proposal,1998.0,"The second part of the story is equally as good, owing in large
part to strong performances by Demi Moore and Robert Redford.; It's
almost impossible to believe that a marriage as strong as that between
David and Diana could be put under this much pressure by something
that, in its essence, is simple.; Here, a similar-yet-different situation is
examined from another perspective.; One of the key
elements of the 1987 Glenn Close/Michael Douglas thriller--obsession--

FATAL ATTRACTION its spark.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the

supposed to be doing the thinking.; There are also
moments of manipulation that are so obvious that the director should
hang his head in shame for thinking to bring tears to the eyes of the
viewers through such a lack of subtlety.; The movie gets off to a good start, but the
need to mold the story into a recognizable Hollywood ""type"" hurts its
chances of saying or being anything better than mediocre.; The last few scenes
are a distinct let-down as the writer resorts to a hard-to-believe quick
fix to conclude things.; From
the voice-over narration to the incessant unnecessary commentary,
nothing is left to the viewer to figure out on his or her own."
4520.0,Sleuth,1999.0,"Andrew 
Wyke is a petty snob, but Olivier makes him into a figure of both great 
humor and great tragedy.; It's a perfect metaphor for all 
that is to come, as the two men square off in a series of increasingly-
desperate games.; Shaffer's 
script is delicious  witty, intelligent, and full of the unexpected.; ""Sleuth"" is a film that most people have not heard of today, but anyone who
sees it is guaranteed a film that is so vastly entertaining that it's
almost a pity when the 140 minutes are over.; The film is relentless in
showing the effects of man-made isolation, the need to be ""above"" everyone
else, and the wonderment of playing God with people, primarily because
you're more intelligent than most people.","The film runs about 2 hours and 20 minutes, but because the film is almost
entirely filled with dialogue, the film flies by, almost seeming too short.; So goes the rest of the film: a series of mind fucks not only on both the
characters on the other, but also on the audience.; The running time, which 
exceeds two hours, flies by.; When we first meet Milo, he 
cuts a rather pathetic figure as someone desperately trying to fit in 
where he doesn't feel comfortable.; It's basically a filmed stage
play, and it's better that way."

faithful adaptation, of a master novelist, whose work still is of importance
today, still quite visible as the decaying industrial society still rapes

been compared, Conrad's visions of the human condition -- the complex 
ies, pessimism of his characters' consciences and souls, the estrangement 
brought on by isolation, guilts, fears and sometimes courage -- are 
literature derived from the challenge of a foreign language.; Tim Roth is excellent in the role of Marlowe, and
John Malkovich is also great as Kurz, although nothing can
top Brando's appearance in Coppola's film.; HEART OF DARKNESS is good film, but only those who didn't
watch Coppola before could appreciate it fully.; This QUALITY adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novella stands
out as the directors finest piece in several years, and shows that he is
(still) quite a capable director.","Unfortunately, the script by
Benedict Fitzgerald, although more faithful to the novel
than APOCALYPSE, still fails to avoid similarities.; Oh, really?; Bernardo Bertolucci 
seemed to be having a Mass for the Dysenterics said  ring his version of 
THE SHELTERING SKY, when perhaps what might have been celebrated was one 
for sexual obfuscation.; These are some of the reasons why UNDER THE 
VOLCANO doesn't work as movie as it might as opera; the  dience is 
pre-judged not to be as interested in Lowry's hallucinatory verbiage as 
it would be about a literal story that doesn't make one damned bit of 
sense.; All said and 
done, the only depth Conrad could supply about how power corrupts, how it 
infects with psychological horror, is through his stylishly arched prose 
-- and it's Marlow's verbal account that supplies whatever depth there   
because Kurtz speaks less than two hundred words."
4816.0,Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,1996.0,"The girl and the
Haitian show their true human feelings toward the samurai warrior and
seem to understand something about him that is vital without being able
to comprehend him.; All in all, I highly recommend GHOST DOG -- it is truly an original.; And it's the latest
in a long string of excellent performances from Forest Whitaker.; Gorman plays Sonny, a
lieutenant who respects the old ways, yet has a quirky affinity for rap
music, a love comically shown in several impromptu displays.; All in all, a refreshing new gangster film featuring a standout performance
by Whitaker, many funny moments, the original stylings of Jimmy Jarmush and
an extra cool soundtrack.","Besides
being boring, pointless and slow, it oozed of pretentious symbolism which I
personally found to be uninvolving, uninteresting and just plain
unentertaining.; The idea seems okay, but some of them are particularly
absurd .; Dude, if I wanted to
use my brain, I would have stayed home and read a book.; But there are times when the director's unhurried
style and slow pacing seem tiring, close to dull, which certainly is a
not very good element.; I simply felt nothing, not even pity, for this remorseless man."
4925.0,Dead Bang,1993.0,"The funniest scene has Johnson throwing-up all over a
criminal as he interrogates him.; But
Beck's family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and
thrills in DEAD-BANG.; Johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of
humor and a hint of depth, and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally
bring the film to life.; The role
must have been really challenging for Johnson since his character, Jerry
Beck, is a gritty Los Angeles homicide detective, a real stretch from the
slick vice detective Johnson portrayed on ""Miami Vice.""; I guess the film's title refers to this love scene since it's
definitely a dead bang.","You would never guess this from
watching DEAD-BANG, however, since the film totally lacks credibility; it
is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable.; William Forsythe, for
example, is painfully bad as Arthur Kressler, a wholesome by-the-book FBI
agent who's offended by Beck's foul language and unorthodox methods.; The action sequences in DEAD-BANG are strictly
third-rate, and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense.; Forsythe's lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character
unbearable.; DEAD-BANG tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating
themes of racism and white supremacy, but its efforts are nothing more than
token gestures and nothing less than insulting."
4951.0,10 Things I Hate About You,1983.0,"Hilarious.; As the main character of Kat, Julia Stiles (last seen 
in the miniseries ""The '60s"") is marvelous and always believable, and 
certainly has a bright future ahead of her.; By the film's end, it actually had me rooting for certain characters to 
get together, and I was also quite pleased with how everything was 
wrapped up, especially in the final scenes involving Kat and Bianca, Kat 
and her father, and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which Kat 
gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class (this is 
where the title comes from).; CRITIQUE:
Light, safe, enjoyable little tale of the teenage world, boasts a couple of
charming and utterly convincing performances from its two stars, quite a few
chuckle-as-you-go-along jokes, and a surprisingly believable component of
depth within a few well-developed movie characters.; Still, those relatively minor complaints are not nearly enough to discredit
this teriffic little movie, which is entertaining despite all of its flaws.","Unfortunately, much of this potentially good material is paced like
a bad sitcom.; The movie lacks weight.; The movie lacks weight.; Unfortunately he is saddled with lame dialog.; He's
seen too many awful pregnancies, births, abortions and such."
5048.0,Prospero's Books,1999.0,"IT IS EXCELLENT.; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN TRULLY MODERN
ADAPTATIONS OF SHAKESPEARE'S WORK.; Above everything is John Gielgud, one of the greatest actors of the 20th
century, playing the bitter, angered Prospero, who plans everything that
goes on in the film, and allows Gielgud to give one of the best
performances of his career.; The nakedness here is an excellent symbol of the freedom of
mind and word, which Prospero wants, and keeps under wraps at almost all
times.; The film KUFFS is a very good movie.","The film is
supposed to be dream sequences, but it runs more like an LSD nightmare
from hell.; I am sorry but I really can't recommend PROSPERO'S BOOKS for
anyone.; Most
of the people in the film (the spirits) seemed to have a real lack of
costumes.; There is a lot of talk
about Prospero's endless amount of books that does nothing for the film.; For more than two hours the viewer is bombarded (with the accent on
""bard"") with visual image after visual image after visual image (although
when he tires of the intellectual content he can take a few minutes of
vacation from it watching the naked bodies)."
5143.0,Hannah and Her Sisters,1998.0,"This is a remarkable, richly textured film, full of warmth, humour,
sadness, and a touching humanity.; It
is a brilliant style that doesn't draw attention to itself, unlike the
remarkably ingenious construction of Annie Hall did.; The way the movie is
structured is wonderfully different from any other previous Allen film-
each new chapter of the movie is introduced with a title card showing a
quotation (like the Tolstoy one), or a character's current thoughts.; In a word: brilliant.; He's both refreshingly honest and oddly calculating in
his agonising over his long-held feelings for his wife's sister and
the passionate affair that follows.","There's no scenery chewing performances here.; It seems to me that this movie is trying to prove Tolstoy
wrong.; The latter is loaded with the usual Woody Wit and 
figures into the plot toward the end, the former is unnecessary and 
is never resolved.; Farrow:
What have you done that could have caused this, was it excessive
masturbation?; Who's the father, out of curiosity?"
5203.0,Wild Orchid,1960.0,"Hemingway does a great job as Dorothy and
Roberts is perfect as the slimy Snider.; I highly
recommend this film to any fan of dramas.; I
recommend this film to people who like provocative dramas.; They are ones that I feel are probably
commonly overlooked and I feel are definitely worth renting.; The
acting is very well done and the script is well written.","Others
will probably find the story cheesy and the acting poor.; Rating: Four.; Rating: Four.; Rating: Four.; Rating: Four."
5233.0,Wild Orchid II: Two Shades of Blue,1999.0,"WILD ORCHID 2: TWO SHADES OF BLUE is the latest film by erotic film
maker Zalman King, who's past films include WILD ORCHID and TWO MOON
JUNCTION.; In WILD ORCHID, I found
the story interesting (as well as erotic).; Siemaszko ends up working at a whorehouse.; Siemaszko sees a
high school boy who she is interested in, but she doesn't know how to
tell him what her profession is.; Things that
happen don't always make sense and are often confusing.","WILD ORCHID 2 skips the
interesting and just tries to be erotic, where it fails miserably.; Tom Skerritt, who gets top billing, is only
on the screen for about fifteen minutes.; My
suggestion is to skip this film and rewatch WILD ORCHID.; WILD ORCHID 2 is not really a sequel to WILD ORCHID, in fact
it has nothing to do with WILD ORCHID.; 111 min., not rated, Drama, 1992
Director: Zalman King
Cast: Wendy Hughes, Tom Skerritt, Robert Davi, Brent Fraser,
      Nina Siemaszko, Christopher McDonald, Joe Dallesandro,
      Casey Sander, Stafford Morgan, Don Bloomfield, Lydie Denier Nina Siemaszko's father Tom Skerritt, an avid drug user, dies."
5241.0,Two Moon Junction,1997.0,"They touch!; The wedding
approaches, and the girl can't make up her mind if she wants to satisfy her
family or her loins.; She sends off negative vibes,
but we can tell she's excited!; Ives and Fletcher grind out their characters as
they have for years.; Lots of muscular skin.","Absolutely without merit, except maybe
derision, and even then I would have preferred to spend my time elsewhere.; But True Lust cannot be daunted by adversity (or common
sense -- neither of these sweat puppies are appealing for anything other than
their sexual stamina).... Fenn was apparently surgically altered to look as much like Madonna as
possible.; Decides not to open it, though, probably due to that annoying heartbeat
tone in the soundtrack.; Pfffffft.; Can you guess what comes
next?)"
5332.0,Dancing at Lughnasa,1996.0,"It's a nice story told in a delightful way.; This is definitely an ensemble film.; Drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once
pained, and at another glance mischievous.; Knowing this helps explain some of the
actions.; ""Lughnasa,"" adapted from Brian Friel's acclaimed play, so beautifully
captures the details of its time and place and its characters' lives
that it's difficult to resist being drawn in.","By then they had wasted an hour and half of fine film stock with
nothing to show for their work other than wasting the audience's time.; His scrambled brain, which appears to have been
fried by too much time in the hot African sun, has his mouth rambling
and speaking nonsense.; This dreadfully dull
film will have you looking in vain for something to keep your interest
lest you begin to nod off.; Instead, we get an hour and a half of director Pat O'Connor
running out the clock.; It is hard to believe that the poorly scripted movie would have been
green-lighted for production without Streep."
5491.0,Battlefield Earth,1993.0,"So due, here are a few kudos to those things well done: Shot of hero
from bottom cage of craft as it lifts off ground is strong and visually
stirring!; It is a movie that makes you cringe and chuckle simultaneously.; Music by
Elia Cmiral.; The look of the film, is dark and drabby at times, but then
bright and happy at other times.; So don't take it all so
seriously and enjoy the ride!","Dull ""and"" stupid.; Not only is it hardly presumptuous to
declare it the worst film of the year 2000, it is no exaggeration to call
this wretched piece of incompetence one of the worst films ever made.; They hire the worst director and cast the most inept actors.; Well
let me be the first to say, and so far in my view it's safe to say:
Battlefield: Earth might be the worst film I have ever seen, yes even worse
than ""Mr. Magoo"", ""Blue In The Face"", or ""Jaws: The Revenge"".; The sound is terrible, and has the worst
surround sound effects I've heard."
5548.0,RoboCop,1997.0,"Like
TERMINATOR, which along with BACK TO THE FUTURE, introduced recursive time
travel stories to the modern audience on a sensible level, ROBOCOP shows us
a lot of wonderful stuff we've read a hundred times, but never seen before.; All in all, ROBOCOP
is one of those rare movies that manage to be funny and
entertaining, yet thought-provoking and dead serious in the
same time.; ROBOCOP is more realistic
than many action movies, including most James Bonds and REMO WILLIAMS.; Like many crime films, ""RoboCop"" relies a great deal on its villains,
and Kurtwood Smith is simply great as the maniacal Boddicker.; Last decade, one of such dystopic worlds was created for the
purpose of ROBOCOP, SF action thriller, known today as the
great Hollywood debut of talented Dutch filmmaker Paul
Verhoeven.","Comic relief is added by throwing some pointed darts at SDI, toxic
waste, and network television.; Peter Weller is Alex Murphy, a
Detroit cop killed in the line of duty, who has been ""recycled"" by SCI's labs.; There is no better way to parlay a $100
robbery into a $100,000 damage-repair bill than to call on the ""Flatfoot of
Steel.""; The ""bad"" V.P., Dick Jones (Cox), has developed a huge robot that would
replace human police officers.; The CEOs of this company are straight from the
cliche book."
5549.0,Robocop 2,2000.0,"Miller attempts to recreate the intelligent social satire which
made the first film intriguing and entertaining.; The movie picks up several loose ends which
were not adequately resolved in the original, such as whether Robocop,
played again by Peter Weller, is simply a machine following a computer
program or whether he is still human, with emotions, thoughts, and
memories.; Under Paul Verhoeven's stylish direction, ROBOCOP was a
novel combination of comic book heroics, gory action, and black humor.; ROBOCOP 2 was co-written by Frank Miller, the author of several
graphic novels, including BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.; The difference is that in TOTAL RECALL
you become apathetic only to the violence itself, whereas in ROBOCOP 2 you
just become apathetic in general.","Regrettably, Miller's first attempt
at screenwriting is a major disappointment.; The sequel's plot is feeble
and fragmented.; Unfortunately,
the television parodies generally seem tacked on; the humor is not only
forced, but also awkwardly incorporated into the movie.; In fact, it really contains two story lines, both of which
are woefully half-baked.; About all the movie has to offer is some remarkable stop-motion
animation, but the film's hollow story line makes its technical
achievements seem pointless."
5551.0,Space Cowboys,1998.0,"In other words, ""Space Cowboys"" was as 
cliched as it could be, but it was also a lot of fun, very entertaining, and 
it even had a few touching moments.; In our disposable society, it is 
surpassingly great to see guys like Garner and Sutherland deliver the 
goods.; At this point the plot 
thickens, the technology quickens, and the movie takes on the feel of 
another space adventure - and an entertaining one at that.; It's quite simply a fun
movie that's as enjoyable as a home cooked meal.; Meeting each of these guys in their natural habitat is a real
comedic treat, as Corvin's first mission of convincing them all to join
is a fun combination of Armageddon and The Blues Brothers.","Her romance
with Jones' character feels contrived and lacks chemistry, seemingly
inserted only because the movie would otherwise lack a romantic subplot.; Unfortunately, the plot also becomes even more of a routine,
by-the-numbers exercise, coming across like a sort of dumbed-down ""Apollo
13"" (I was tempted to say ""Armageddon"", but nothing could be that dumb).; Even thought they're supposed to be similarly aged, Garner was
in college while Jones was in diapers.; Well, don't get me wrong, James Garner is 
certainly the man, but even he can't save a role where he's given no more 
than fifteen or twenty minutes of screen time.; Less successful was Garner; it
didn't help that his character was mistakenly hobbled to start with [I'd
like to throttle whomever decided that making him an uninspired preacher
was A Good Idea], and neither Tank the character nor Garner the actor,
were given much more to work with throughout the flick."
5677.0,Trancers,1997.0,"Good maniacal fun, lots of neat parts, and a very clean plot that
makes sense and is clever to boot.; It's a good idea to remember that it
precedes those other two SF movies, since so many of the elements are similar.; TRANCERS (USA, 1982)
Director: Charles Band
Screenwriters: Danny Bilson, Paul de Meo
Cast: Tim Thomerson, Helen Hunt, Michael Stefani, Art La Fleur This film is probably familiar to those of you who have righteous cable
service, but to those of us who don't, it's a mystery.; It was made before
BLADERUNNER or THE TERMINATOR, but it has elements of both.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Set in the
future, we have tough cop John Death (Tim Thomerson) tracking down Trancers,
mutants who can make ""weak-minded"" people turn white, froth at the mouth, and
obey their every whim (rather like some TV evangelists I know of).; Death is sent
back to the past to stop the plot, and gets messed up in the kind of senseless
violence you'd expect in this kind of film, at time having to out-run bullets,
elsewhere almost being tanned to death.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
5680.0,"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark",1999.0,"In that role she provides a lot of campy fun as she
pokes fun at some wretched films and at herself.; The kind of films Elvira, Mistress of the Dark often runs on her
television show.; Cassandra Petersen has a good flair for comedy.; ELVIRA is not ""badfilm.""; She also has big boobs
and great legs.","I like bad films.; The
humor is all forced, and apparently aimed at the lowest common denominator
among fourteen-year-olds.; I can't honestly say I had high hopes for ELVIRA, but gosh, it *was* at
least co-written by Petersen and fellow Groundling John Paragon.; But maybe, just maybe, the film should have been better.; Perhaps I should be able to enjoy ninety minutes of breast
jokes."
5852.0,Angel Eyes,2000.0,"There 
are also bits of pure pleasure: Catch picks up a trumpet on the 
bandstand at a blues club and plays a nicely haunting rendition of 
""Nature Boy"".; It is an intelligent, 
impassioned adult romance that has a lot to say, and doesn't feel the need to 
let a rock soundtrack full of love ballads explain it.; (His happiness can be seen in strange ways.; This isn't a gotta-see-it movie, it's more of a 
what's-at-the-movies movie.; Infinitely more mature and delicately plotted than 
most big, studio-distributed love stories, it enraptures you in its humane 
characters and their plight from the very beginning, and doesn't let go until 
the emotionally honest conclusion.","It may be a sign of a beginning thaw, or perhaps just of audience 
desperation, but this year's bad movies are beginning to seem a little 
less bad.; 2001 - 102 minutes
Rated R (for violence, profanity, and sex).; Why is his kitchen drawer
stashed full of children's toys?; Less convincing, however, was the romantic aspect.; While watching the theatrical trailer and television ads for ""Angel Eyes"" 
would lead you to believe the film is a supernatural romance, along the lines 
of 1990's ""Ghost"" or 1998's ""City of Angels,"" it really isn't at all."
5894.0,Blue in the Face,1994.0,"Good humor and honest performances in the first segment
lead into a stunning war sequence that's not for the faint- hearted.; All the while--as well as in in some
sketches with other people--Keitel listens, adds some words, always
makes you feel that he is real and cares about those around him.; During the
course of the film, we're exposed to the Brooklyn of the past, the
Brooklyn of today, and an idealized Brooklyn that exists only in
memories tinged by fondness and nostalgia.; Lily
Tomlin plays a man in search of Belgian waffles, Michael J.; This is not your typical Hollywood fare.","The laughs are few, the set design is
lousy, and there isn't one single campy cameo to speak of.; Huge chunks of the story
seem to be missing, perhaps to trim an already- healthy running time?; Her acting is atrocious.; He fails at almost every
cross.; In another sense it is close
to e-mail chat, but with a much higher ratio of interesting to dull."
6068.0,Six Days Seven Nights,1958.0,"There is excellent, albeit subtle, chemistry between Robin and
Quinn.; Definitely worth watching.; Amazing.; And, while the 
screenplay isn't top-notch, it offers a few genuinely funny one-liners 
and a couple of scenes of surprisingly effective dialogue.; This is a fairly good movie that
manages to be entertaining and fun despite its obvious failings.","They just have almost nothing to work with,
squirming around with absurd situations and stick-figure characters.; The foreshadowing is so
blatantly obvious it's pathetic.; Instead, it comes out a bit limp, which is disappointing
considering the promise and talent involved.; **1/2 (out of 4) 6 DAYS lacks originality.; Neither put much emotion into their
acting, probably because they've deserve better and have done much better than
this and thus they have no chemistry."
6071.0,Kiss of Death,1993.0,"Samuel L. Jackson, who has fashioned a reputation as one 
of today's finest actors, turns in another on-the-mark performance as a 
police officer trying to resolve conflicting emotions about his quarry.; The film opens with Jimmy Kilmartin (David Caruso, late of NYPD 
BLUE) enjoying the rigors of everyday family life with wife Bev (Helen 
Hunt) and baby daughter Karina.; Caruso's good, Cage is over the top, Jackson is worth
the price of admission.; It's worth the price of
admission just for a certain hilarious twist in Little Junior's strip
joint.; Michael Rapaport, still growing his hair out from his role as the
skinhead in HIGHER LEARNING, is fantastic as the sleazy Ronnie right
through to his brutal comeuppance, as is Anthony Heald in a small
role as Little Junior's slick and savvy attorney.","Despite a one-
hundred minute running time, the movie fails to resolve several obvious 
hanging threads, and the climax is so weak that the only real clue that 
the credits are about to roll is a slow pull back and pan by the camera.; Unfortunately, all of that gets flushed away in the movie's climax, a mess
of thriller/chase cliches that wraps things up a little too neatly.; The result is a great deal of running around, 
meaningless and unconvincing attempts at character and relationship 
building, and a horribly manipulative ""child in jeopardy"" scenario.; Maybe a more over-the-top directing style would have suited the
material, which is by itself convoluted as all hell.; Hunt's
talent is wasted as Jimmy's estranged wife, and it appears that a big
chunk of her screen time was left on the cutting room floor."
6072.0,One Eight Seven,1996.0,"""187"", much like the ""Death Wish"" series, got a little carried away
as it progressed, but nevertheless, it's an entertaining look at how
deeply violence can affect a regular person.; What makes the film work, perhaps better than it has any right to
be, is Jackson, who brings a quiet dignity and slow-simmering anger to
Trevor that is fascinating.; Yes, it does deal with an
inner city teacher (Trevor Garfield, played by Samuel L. Jackson), and it
does deal with his attempts to get through to certain of his students.; In that atmosphere Garfield tries
to shed a little light.; His performance is raw
and haunting, like a priest experiencing a crisis of faith.","After an implausible first half, the film loses all credibility in
the second.; What were screenwriter (and former substitute
teacher) Scott Yagemann and the Director thinking of?; No, we
need a teacher vigilante instead.; In about the last 20 minutes, the movie turned sickeningly ludicrous.; It's clear that the makers of ""187"" want to leave viewers angry and
frustrated."
6116.0,Spice World,1995.0,"Its somewhat surprising that Spice World turned out to be such a
clever contraption of comedy and song, and whilst the obvious strength
of the movie is its fabulous music scenes, everything shown is sexy,
catchy and great fun for teens of both sexes.; But I loved it.; In SPICEWORLD,
the highly popular singing group the Spice Girls accomplish their major goal:
mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing
it.; The group's many detractors may be
dismayed to discover the Girls have a winning sense of humor about
themselves, their image and their art.; The film's humor works best at its most self-deprecating.","The plot is such a mess that it's
terrible.; Neither amusing or
spontaneous, when the Spice Girls are between songs they are deadly
boring.; If you're not a fan of the Girls, let me save you an
hour and a half of saffron: don't waste your thyme on this one.; The film isn't even 
a particularly good musical, because the songs are so inane.; There is nothing biting about this mockumentary (if one
can call it that); if it were a Spice World, after all, the world
would be very bland indeed."
6282.0,Coyote Ugly,1996.0,"Everything ends in triumph -- and, of
course, a cuddly reunion with the love interest.; Rest assured, all this
is presented as good, clean fun.; The
Australian love-interest was also effective and John Goodman perfect as the
overweight daddy with a big heart.; But
it also hews very closely to all the genre cliches, and at times
feels obscenely contrived.; In a way its a bit 
like ""Cocktail"" and ""Flashdance"" in these scenes, they are very well 
utilized, and mixed with some great music we have.","Cliché-infested and so utterly tired and worn out as to make itself
appear a relic of the early 1980s, Coyote Ugly is just plain bad.; God knows,
because this movie focuses solely on the lead big-lipped girl named Piper
Perabo, a semi-interesting character, who unfortunately is not enough to
carry an entire movie.; And the worst
thing about the movie trailers wasn't that they gave away the whole plot
[""Plot?; Perabo's role
is so badly acted it would be cause for raspberries galore were it not
for an even worse script.; of unruly, bizarre behavior - like hosing down the crowd if someone
orders water, even setting fire to the bar - but that's about the only
interesting thing in this otherwise dull, wretchedly cliche-filled
movie."
6393.0,Taking Care of Business,1998.0,"Jimmy uses the
Filofax to pick up where Spencer left off, enjoying the rich life in
Malibu before the game while Spencer searches frantically to find out
who has taken his identity away from him.; TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS, a film by Hollywood Pictures starring
James Belushi and Charles Grodin, explores what it thinks is the
nightmare of every overworked yuppie: losing one's Filofax.; Belushi has escaped temporarily from jail to
     go watch the Cubs in the World Series.; It follows the same plot lines that have been done as
recently as in OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS (although this film does it better)
and as long ago as in THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER.; We even get to shop the variety of colors and
styles the datebook is available in.","The movie takes the safe, numbingly predictable path and lets the
comic talent of its stars compensate for lack of tension, photography,
and script.; If you're in
the mood to turn off your brain for a couple of hours, spending a
matinee show in TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS wouldn't be a bad idea.; And the movie does nothing but get more improbable from there.; Improbable movie with a
     lot of cheap jokes, but a few funny ones, too.; Rating: +1 1/2 out of -4 to
+4."
6415.0,Three Kings,2000.0,"I highly recommend this film.; Highly recommended.; Highly recommended.; Highly recommended, but not for the
squeamish.; THREE KINGS may not be a pleasant film to watch, but it is
intelligent and certainly has to be the best film about the Persian
Gulf War yet.","There's just not enough to shake the sense
that THREE KINGS is too enamored of its sense of historical importance.; I am constantly talking about hype.; Shot with a real (or a pretend) 16 millimiter hand-held movie camera 
(unless it is supposed to be video), the sights have that typical 
graininess, jerkiness and relative un-sharpness of news footage.; Although it's never a bad film, it rarely rises much above a typical
action one, even given its pretentious filming style.; This boring, overlong, pretentious movie does a disservice to the
American soldier and the American audience alike."
6435.0,Practical Magic,1999.0,"I liked the way the story had characters worth caring for, and the
film is essentially a comedy, yet, had touching, dramatic moments.; His lonely but
strong cop is the best of the characters in Practical Magic.; The comedic touches are hilarious at times.; His cast is excellent and they work each
scene with verve.; Towards the end of the film, a neighborhood phone tree is used in a 
unique fashion that is both ingenuous and entertaining.","But instead its
just mediocre.; It doesn't really
matter, cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting,
that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them, or the film as
a whole.; Not a good start.; But Practical Magic is just plain bad -- a confused
disaster, tedious and cloying and singularly moronic.; No Oscars, no Golden Globes, not even a
stupid Blockbuster Award look near in your future."
6522.0,Life,2000.0,"It is a drama, too; sentimental and poignant with very subtle but
effective social commentary.; The film is told in flashback at the beginning and takes us back through the
years leading up to the film's excellent finale.; ', 'Trading Places', 'Beverly Hills Cop', 'Beverly Hills Cop II',
and 'Coming to America' are all great classic films in their own way for
their genre.; Fortunately, for 
the benefit of this film, they both turn out beautiful performances that 
are certainly their finest so far.; But if you judge him
ONLY on his movie performances, he was great.","The film tries too hard to prove that racism is bad, with a number of foolish
stories to show this, that we never learn about any of the characters suffering
from it.; ""Life"" tries to do this but fails
because not enough scenes are devoted for the two jokers to show their skills.; Thus many times he
fails to entertain because he does to his scripts what God never meant for
him to do.; I
couldn't have cared less about the characters or the story line, and most
certainly would not recommend this film to anyone looking for interesting
characters, an interesting story line or an original idea.; I am not sure if the characters were
supposed to be changed men after this whole experience but it certainly did not
appear this way."
6552.0,Idle Hands,1999.0,"There have been many classic films that provide a nearly flawless balance
between comedy and horror.; The actors are all very good with Devon Sawa pulling off a
great performance as the Mary-Jane-slacker-kid with the possessed hand, and
Seth Green continuing his streak of solid comedic showings as one of the
lively undead.; It may not be a great 
 movie, but it's one of the most amusing times I've had at the multiplex 
 this whole year.; First and foremost, this film was an extremely nostalgic experience for 
 me, a fun and twisted throwback to the goofy slasher films of the '80s.; Due to 
 this example and several other impressively-shot scenes, the 
 cinematography is distinctive and well-done, as is the memorable music 
 score by composer Graeme Revell.","The story's gore quickly becomes tiresome.; The whole film gives the 
impression of wanting to open up into something much more raucous and 
vulgar, but director Flender does the criminal thing for this type of film - 
he is too tame, his vulgarity lacks imagination.; Perhaps Sam Raimi would have known how
to extend the premise to 90 minutes, but these filmmakers don't.; The 
overall idea of a possessed hand is fairly lame - and in terms of horror the 
hand holds so little threat as to border on the laughable.; The best -- or worst of
these depending on your point of view -- is microwaving the bad hand as
we watch its skin slowly explode, spewing blood all over the microwave."
6878.0,Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey,1961.0,"In 1963, Disney came out with a
relatively enjoyable film called THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY.; That certainly makes
the animals easier to understand, and it opens the way for a lot of humor--a
la LOOK WHO'S TALKING--but it regrettably pushes the story into fantasy.; I was twelve years old when I read Sheila Burnford's INCREDIBLE
JOURNEY.; Not a perfect film, but
generally one that should please adults and children.; HOMEWARD BOUND contains a 
scene where a little girl is encouraged to approach Shadow, a dog she
has never seen before.","Robert Hayes
does a pitiful acting job, and the writing for the scenes with the
humans is so embarrassing that at times I found them difficult to
watch.; This is not a good lesson to be
teaching children.; Obviously written for children, HOMEWARD BOUND is filled with 
trite cliches, unbelievable coincidences, and poor acting (on the part
of the humans).; Perhaps the movie was short on running time, so material better
left on the cutting room floor was included.; If that's the case, it
was an ill-advised move."
6950.0,Outbreak,1987.0,"Yes, this movie is an entertaining and sometimes wildly-exhilarating
ride.; Outbreak is an overall fun film to see, so don't miss this movie.; This germ detective story is
excellent and the pacing is good so that your eyes stay glued to the
screen.; It is complex and yet quite easy to follow.; This brilliant
actor (GLORY, DRIVING MISS DAISY, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, etc.)","But the final forty minutes or so
has some serious sacrifices of logic for commerciality.; Somebody
apparently decided that the more interesting and more credible story
would not sell.; More disappointing,
the race to understand and control the new virus is diverted into a
standard action-film chase.; Suppose some new virus that came along was something so bad
that the rights of the afflicted were overwhelmed by the danger they
pose to those not yet afflicted.; Naturally, all notions of
credibility go down the toilet and the viewers' intelligence
is repeatedly insulted with the series of implausibilities -
while average R&D in real life pharmaceutical industry takes
years to create drugs, our hero manages to extract the
medicine in the matter of minutes, just to save his wife in
time; bomber crews, which are trained to exterminate
millions of innocent civillians without any remorse, are
simply talked into disobeying the direct order)."
7093.0,Vatel,2000.0,"Since the key to a man's heart can be found in his
stomach, the prince enlists the aid of his talented steward,
Francois Vatel (Gerard Depardieu), to set up a groaning
board, a wise choice since the master chef is able not only to
lead a cadre of peasants in the preparation of the meal but is
able to con his suppliers into handing him the victuals without
payment.; The story's thrust comes from an invitation delivered by
Louis XIV's favorite stooge, the Marquis de Lauzun (Tim
Roth), to the provincial Prince de Conde (Julian Glover)
announcing that the Versailles court will favor the prince's
western regions for a touch of rustic life.; The only french things in it is Gerard Depardieu and the setting.; Set in 1671, the story is about the visit of King Louis XIV to the Castle of
Prince Conde.; Although it is a non-Hollywood movie, it has all the elements of Hollywood.","Director Roland Joffe (""The Mission,"" ""The
Killing Fields"") is intent on evoking this early on in his new
movie, ""Vatel.""; It looked
like a love triangle, but it wasn't.; And then the fish came too late, or he was just
too impatient.; Director Roland Joffe (""The
Killing Fields"") concocts an indulgent feast-for-the eye but what he
sacrifices at the banquet is character development.; As a
result, the audience remains emotionally uninvolved."
7267.0,Nothing to Lose,2001.0,"Todd Solondz's ""Welcome to the
Dollhouse"" brings this out better than any other American
movie about 12-year-old kids.; What's different is that the movie is funny.; I can't figure out if I like him or hate
him, but I liked him in this movie: he does things with his voice and face
that shouldn't be physically possible, which is half the reason for the
laughs he gets.; The story takes place in suburban New Jersey with a stint
in Atlantic City and involves Ray's plans to make big bucks
fast in order to get his girl friend Joanne (Sybil Temchen) a
diamond ring and set himself up in his own business.; Nick works for an advertising company which fills his hours, but he still
manages to find time for his wife.","In laying
out a misadventure that befalls its principal figure, Eric Bross--
who wrote the screenplay with Tom Cudworth--introduces a
story that has the stamp or autobiography.; ""Ten Benny"" is a low-budget job that has made the rounds of
the indie circuit in L.A. and Sundance, a small picture
featuring earnest acting but one which leaves the viewer
unsatisfied.; Frank Vincent
as the boy's father, Ray Sr., stands out in a relatively small
role, bearing the professionalism and soignee of an
established performer in a movie that is nothing distinctive or
bearing the flavor of a work you could not see any night on
TV.; A droopy-faced character,
Adrien Brody does not inspire his audience to care all that
much about what happens to him, nor do his pals--who are a
typical bunch of suburbanites who celebrate one another's
birthday parties and spend most of their leisure time together-
-offer much in the way of audience curiosity.; And the scene with the security guard Goth-dancing in the laser
vault has to be seen to be believed."
7305.0,Alive,1997.0,"ALIVE is an adventure story that grapples with themes more profound
than most movies of the genre.; It is an
adventure tale with depth and breadth that would put many dramas to
shame.; Well-produced, acted, and scripted, this is a film that has to
be seen to be experienced, even by those who know the entire story.; The plane crash
sequence, perfectly led up to and executed, is hair-raising, perhaps
the most terrifying crash ever shown in a movie (including those in the
AIRPLANE films and DIE HARD 2).; The film begins and ends with a close-up of an uncredited John 
Malkovich, who, playing one of the survivors, reflects back on the
ordeal and how it has affected his life since then.","A less inspired effort would have resulted in a film with reduced
impact.; One of the disadvantages of having so many characters is that few
of them attain independence from the mass as far as the audience is 
concerned.; There are
only three characters who have enough screen time, dialogue, and
interaction to achieve depth:  Nando Parrado (Ethan Hawke),  Antonio
Balbi (Vincent Spano), and Roberto Cannessa (Josh Hamilton).; Running Length:  2:06
Rated:  R (Language, disturbing images, cannibalism) Starring:  Ethan Hawke, Vincent Spano, Josh Hamilton
Director:  Frank Marshall
Producers:  Robert Watts and Kathleen Kennedy

8068.0,Desperado,1998.0,"Ironically, one of the film's best performances was by Cheech Marin
(from Cheech and Chong), who finds a relaxed, humorous tone for his
role as the short bartender.; The first half of the
film is craftily put together with an excellent eye for both humor and
suspense.; At times, DESPERADO almost has too
much atmosphere for its own good.; As he
closes in, things get bloodier and bloodier until the final showdown
where everything is revealed.; The movie actually surprised me.","Not even
9's.; All dressed up and nowhere to go.; Although obviously talented, Buscemi, with his big eyes
and fast mouth, isn't much more than a sight-gag this film.; Unfortunately, what we have as a first product is an
other example of the paucity of good scripts in Hollywood.; Unfortunately, DESPERADO is twenty minutes longer than
the director's debut, and the added length results in a stagnant pace."
8077.0,Alien,1998.0,"This is a great score.; Yaphet
Kotto is excellent as Parker, bickering giant that has a
great heart; and, finally, Harry Dean Stanton gives another
subtle performance of his quiet and dim-witted, yet very
sympathetic assistant Brett.; His
direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no
""Alien"" film has before.; It is, however, very, very *good* and I more than highly recommend
it.; Ridley Scott, who was at his prime in
late 1970s and early 1980s, showed great skill in creating
very distinctive visual images.","It's not that ""Alien 3"" is a bad movie per se, there's just not enough to
appreciate.; (Hit 'n' now if you want to avoid a slightly bigger spoiler) Ripley's final sacrifice is utterly melodramatic, predictable and
boring.; If the other films failed from
excessiveness, this one fails from depravity and blandness.; The dialogue is so bad it is distracting at every turn, the acting
is not horrid, but it is uninspired and flat through-out.; It is not as bad a movie as HIGHLANDER II, but it is not much
better."
8078.0,Alien: Resurrection,1999.0,"That is what makes this episode great.; It doesn't matter anyway - this is a wonderfully entertaining
film, saturated with Jeunet's (where's Marc Caro?); It kept me on the edge of my seat, it made me laugh
(appropriately, of course) and it made me glad that this was such a strong
rebound from the last sequel.; I had a great day at the movies today (11/26).; He is a gem.","Part of the blame should go on Joss Whedon
for writing a weak screenplay, with ridiculous dialogue and poor attempts at humor.; I didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful; most of the acting
was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful
viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to
give this pointless dribble some meaning.; And what a disappointment it is.; It's just disappointing who that person is.; On the plus side, this film looks great and has the usual computerized
special effects which are now standard procedure for movies and the
technical aspects all around are impressive but its attempt to redeem
itself from the failure of the third film is only mildly successful
and its shallow attempt at continuing the story that should have been
laid to rest long ago is painfully obvious."
8129.0,My Name Is Joe,1994.0,"And when ""My Name is Joe"" is 
lingering over shared moments between not only its two protagonists, but 
with others like a soccer team and other aquaintances of the leads, it's 
one of the best films of the year.; My Name Is Joe is a powerful and memorable return to form for
Loach, and one of the year's most satisfying and unforgettable films.; Loach has created a sobering study of the disenfranchised, a film that
is worth taking note of, that probes into serious matters, and is honest
enough to know that there are no simple answers to the problems it
raises.; But Loach's keen eye for
unpolished reality (down to the gravy-thick Scottish accents; thankfully
the film, while in English, is subtitled) and Mullan's passionate,
well-modulated turn keeps the film well worth watching.; His latest
film, MY NAME IS JOE, is one of the most powerful and intense
character studies I have seen in years.","Shanks
suggests a cheap date: why doesn't he take her bowling.; For a film that steers so far 
away from sucumbing to becoming maudlin, it'd be nice if it just went - 
and excuse my clumsy allusion to a recent Disney movie here - the 
distance.; Loach and Laverty
are apparently at a loss as to how to recover from that misstep, and the
film abruptly ""stops"" rather than ""ends.""; Even by the time he's resorted 
to the cliche of doing away with his alcohol aversion, we don't feel so 
much that a cliche has been touched upon, but that Joe himself as a 
character and as a person has been deeply woudned, perhaps without any 
hope.; While Joe is
ruggedly handsome, his hair is thinning and there is a suggestion of
the need for some dental work."
8195.0,Ronin,2000.0,"The performances from the
ensemble international cast are solid, and of an unusually high
calibre for the action genre.; The camera work is a bit shaky at times, but
   effective overall.; Like _Fiction_, it sports
an excellent diverse cast, each character with mixed motives.; Reno creates a
pleasant, sympathetic character, while both Skarsgard and Pryce turn in
memorable performances as truly chilling individuals.; In RONIN, it's there, thanks to some of
the best car chases on film.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; * * - Pretty bad.; The writer seemed to be
attempting to make a smart action movie, but failed to understand that just
because there are surprises, it doesn't add too the credibility of a senseless
script.; No
dialogue.; The film stifles the acting skills of most of its talent, then
commits the unforgivable offense of asking the audience to sit back and
accept the characters' lack of knowable motivation or sympathizability."
8216.0,Meet the Feebles,1998.0,"However, it is
also what is probably one of the most hilarious films I've ever seen,
taking a backseat only to some of the Monty Python flicks.; Underneat we have a hilariously scatching satire of the line between how we
view celebrities and how they really are.; And there's more...but I won't get into it, as one of the movie's chief
pleasures is having the delightfully witty narrative unfold before you.; To the outside world, the stars of ""The Fabulous Feebles
Variety Hour"" television special are celebrities worthy of adoration,
but those who spend time behind-the-scenes know the real story.; Although it's often a big task to watch, the reward for making through it
is a fiercely funny and satirical film which may be foul, disgusting, and
horrific to watch, but at the same time, entertaining, mesmerizing, and
unforgettable, which isn't always a good thing, but here's an exception.","On top of this, Robert (a hedgehog who
pronounces his name ""Wobert"") has just landed a new job in the chorus, and
Trevor (the aforementioned rat) is trying to recruit the poor hedgehog's
poodle girlfriend Lucille as new talent for his smut pictures.; Calling this film ""bizarre"" is far
too tame--it's sick, ribald, and willing to try just about anything.; Those not specifically on the lookout for this
film will probably miss meeting the Feebles, which may be a good thing,
considering the potentially-horrified reaction of someone who
unwittingly walks into a theater showing this feature.; 97
minutes is nothing normally, but when you have puppets talking and doing
shit for that long, it seems like an eternity.; It is a film so crude, so tasteless and so lurid that one
can only wonder how it was even released in the first place."
8217.0,Alice,1990.0,"Thoughts of independence begin to pop into her head under 
hypnosis at the office of Dr. Wang, a radical Chinese (although 
you'd never know it from the name) healer who prescribes herbs 
and diagnoses through the pulse.; Wang gives her several batches of herbs that further 
along her contemplations of an affair with Joe Mantegna.; Mia finds 
herself lying to her husband (William Hurt, who is more than a little 
hurt by the news of the affair) and discovers her friends' (including 
backstabbing TV executive Cybil Shepherd) true feelings about her.; ), so she can listen in on Mantegna's 
comments about her.; The second make her 
invisible (Shortly after ALICE came out, invisibility drugs became 
available over the counter.","It's more than a little ironic that a man who is 
normally so laughable for the right reasons once in awhile makes 
movies that are laughable for the wrong reasons.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
8224.0,8MM,1998.0,"What it is is a frighteningly real and intense film that audiences 
won't enjoy as much as be shocked by.; But in its own right, the
new Nicolas Cage thriller 8MM is an excellent film.; Cage gives a none-too-subtle
but still riveting performance as Welles, but his performance gets is
quite overstated if you watch closely.; California, despite his name, is a
surprisingly intelligent and complex character, and Phoenix does a very good
job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character.; It also helps that Cage is in the
main role; he's such a powerful, believable actor, and he brings the
necessary desperation to Tom without going over-the-top.","I found it bland,
boring and pretentious.; Here, in 8mm, he's
boring, uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice.; Now, I'm not saying that 8MM was a bad film, it was terrible!; This film just reeks of bad.; Peter Stormare turns in an enjoyably
scenery-munching exhibition as the maker of the snuff film but the
remaining members of the cast manage to be boring at best and ludicrous
at worst."
8293.0,Howards End,2000.0,"HOWARD'S END is the latest and, I think, the best film yet from the
team of Merchant, Ivory, and Jhabvala.; It is as if Helen's vision leads her past the confusion
of the transitional Edwardian society that her contemporaries are caught
up in and onto a more frightening, lonelier, more honest world.; Review in short:  An excellent movie from the same creative team that
brought us A ROOM WITH A VIEW.; Scales is fluffy and lovable as the
Devon aunt of the Schlegel sisters.; Anthony Hopkins also gives a devastating portrait of Henry Wilcox,
the great man of business, the prig, the hypocrite, the keeper of secret
guilts, the fragile monster.","The plot is involved and interesting, but this is not a plot-driven
movie.; It doesn't hurt anyone that the source novel is Forster's masterpiece,
but a less gifted writer than Jhabvala could easily have gotten lost in
the many layers and characters, the scope, of the original.; Alas, I have the name of neither director in front of
me.; He is not an evil
man, but he is a hypocrite.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
8337.0,They Live,1998.0,"Produced 
while Carpenter's career seemed to be in a lull, this is nevertheless 
one of his most enjoyable outings; a snappy-paced romp that stays 
offbeat until its closing frames.; Film has some shocks and 
violence but is mostly great fun - it's no coincidence that Carpenter 
counts it among his own favorites.; As with all Carpenter's films, this one is great to look at - he prefers 
to take his horror out of the shadows and into the hyper-real with 
sharp, clear photography and sparkling color.; At last, a movie for those of us who wanted those X-Ray glasses we saw 
advertised in comics when we were kids.; Consequently, the most memorable moments are the 
simplest: Piper taking a slow walk down the block, newly aware that it 
is replete with aliens; Piper and work buddy Keith David stubbornly 
duking it out in an alley; Piper being struck by a woman he has taken 
hostage.","What's probably most appealing about 
THEY LIVE is that it confines its global-conspiracy storyline to a 
radius of a few miles and a timespan of a few days.; The real problem with THEY LIVE is that Carpenter has taken his five-
page story and added little to it but padding.; And
mindlessness in the media is very apropos for the plot of THEY LIVE, though
at one point in the film Carpenter explicitly lists himself and George
Romero as being part of the solution rather than part of the problem.; Most of the padding is
action scenes which undiscerning audiences have come to accept as a
substitute for plot.; All our literature and advertising and television
gives us nothing but subliminal messages like ""Buy,"" ""Obey,"" ""Stay asleep,""
""No imagination,"" ""Marry and reproduce,"" and ""No independent thought."""
8347.0,Running on Empty,2001.0,"Lumet's portrayal of the Pope family packs a powerful emotional
punch.; One of the most
underrated actresses in the business, Christine Lahti--who was last seen in
the unjustly neglected HOUSEKEEPING--plays Annie Pope.; As the conflicted young pianist, Phoenix is riveting in an Oscar-calibre
performance.; This heartbreaking drama is
one of the year's best films.; Phoenix's
father, played by Judd Hirsch, opposes his college plans.","For
example, the scene of Lahti visiting her father for the first time since
going underground is excruciatingly painful to watch.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; for a crime you did not commit."
8367.0,Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,1995.0,"PRINCE OF THIEVES is an undeniably entertaining crowd-pleaser,
thanks to rousing action scenes and robust performances from Morgan Freeman
and Alan Rickman.; Still, the movie is definitely worth viewing on the big screen.; You will love it.; In some ways, he was our
spokesman, our eyes, the one who sees the barbarism of Merry Olde
England and comments on it both in words and body language.; All the principals and most of the supporting players are obviously
having a wonderful time.","Being an American actor, Costner, 
apparently, is not trained in doing accents, so he did not attempt to
sustain even a stage-British accent, but instead compromised by
broadening some vowels and dropping some r's.; Part of the problem with this movie is the far-too-campy
performance by Alan Rickman as the sheriff, and the really awful lines
he is given to say.; If everyone
else in the film had had American accents it probably wouldn't have been
so noticeable (c.f., DANGEROUS LIAISONS and AMADEUS), but the mixture
just doesn't work.; Be careful not to confuse the movie with the inept 20th
Century Fox version starring Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman, which truly is
an appalling waste of time.; Why
do screen writers persist on doing this????"
8391.0,When Night Is Falling,1994.0,"Petra also has one of the best lesbian pick-up lines of all
time, ""Camilla!; Rozema makes quite a departure from her earlier, brilliant I'VE
HEARD THE MERMAIDS SINGING, and turns in a tepid, softcore epic worthy
of Zalman King (RED SHOES DIARY).; A chance
encounter there with the exotic Petra (Rachel Crawford) leads Camilla
into new territory.; On the other hand, her
lesbian encounters with Petra are delightful and erotic.; Camilla's first glimpse of Petra in her ""other world"" of the
circus is when Petra steps out of a silhouette against a drumskin to
reveal shes done up in a skin-tight leather jump suit, with pilot
goggles like Rocky the flying squirrel.","Or maybe he tried to make
it through the script.; Unfortunately, Rozema's script doesn't do justice to these potentially
charged issues, preferring cliches and shallow dialogue to something
more challenging and compelling.; The film is *so* bad, in fact that its high camp
watermark might make it a candidate for the next BAD MOVIES WE LOVE
book.; Sure, it doesn't make sense, but neither do any of the major
plot points.; And Don McKellar, who
recently appeared in Atom Egoyan's EXOTICA, is annoying in the largely-
superfluous role of the circus organizer."
8413.0,Event Horizon,1949.0,"It's very enjoyable and
has some amazing visuals.; All though it's probably too late now to see it at the theaters, Event
Horizon is a definite must-see video.; While in ALIEN, the crew has to cope with a ferocious
creature while encased within tight spaces, in EVENT HORIZON, the forces
which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and
horrifying.; While in ALIEN, the crew has to cope with a ferocious
creature while encased within tight spaces, in EVENT HORIZON, the forces
which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and
horrifying.; The
special effects were amazing, except for some of the floating space
debris which was clearly computer generated, the editing was tight and
moved the story quite nicely, the sound and score was perfect, never
overpowering and perfectly underscoring the visuals and the story!","And none of this can
save the movie from being a D-grade level of film.; =20
Here, however, none of the characters are remotely sympathetic or=20
interesting.; But the final
execution is extremely disappointing.; can't rescue such a poorly-developed character.; The truly disappointing thing about Philip Eisner's script is that,
for a while, it looks like it's headed somewhere interesting."
8447.0,Angels and Insects,1996.0,"Highly recommended.; Excellent film, very well directed and beautifully thought out.; Although not 
hopeful that a match is likely, William nevertheless courts Eugenia, and 
is greatly surprised when she accepts his marriage proposal.; It is brutal in ways more than one.; He does notice her wrists when she draws the insects so
perfectly, and feels very close to her intellectually.","Actually, the worst part of the movie is not the plodding
direction, it is the stilted script by Belinda and Philip Haas.; The drawback of ANGELS AND INSECTS is a combination of lackluster 
characterization and mediocre acting.; The problem
with the film, was that it was tedious and had no emotional oomph to it.; So maybe it's because the film wore me out in its first section
that I found the second half fairly tedious.; However, this film just has one of those understated feelings, none of the
acting stands out, probably because it might give the film away, and for the
majority of the film, it has moments that are just trying to ""break out""
this rather monotonous film, into something else."
8463.0,Torch Song Trilogy,1994.0,"A confrontational 
penultimate sequence is also very well-done, between Fierstein and 
Bancroft.; Originally this story was three hour-long one-act plays by Fierstein:
""The International Stud,"" ""Fugue in a Nursery,"" and ""Widows and Children
First.""; Many moments in ""Torch Song Trilogy,"" do ring true, however, despite its 
faults, and I suspect it is largely due to Fierstein brilliant 
performance.; Karen Young, in a supporting role as Ed's 
sympathetic wife, also adds a lot of humanity to all of her scenes, 
although I wish she would have had more to do.; I have never seen him have such a juicy role before, and he 
pulls it off flawlessly.","It is
as if we are paying to be an audience for Fierstein giving his mother what-
for.; Fierstein himself starred,
which must have made him awfully difficult to direct.; I will generally find these films pretty fatuous and dull.; Capsule review:  Disappointing window into the gay sex
     life shows a lot of the same elements as a straight sex life.; It is as if he is turning his ""what-I-should-have-saids"" into
""I-saids."""
8468.0,Highway 61,1999.0,"Both McKellar and Bulhagiar give strong
performances, as do Pastko and Breck (as Watson).; He is especially shocked when Jackie steals the lifesavings
of the Watsons, three untalented little girls and their showbiz father
who travel around the country, ""bringing pop to the people.""; The NEW YORK TIMES reports that ROADKILL, a previous collaboration
   between McDonald and McKellar, won best film at the 1989 Toronto Film
   festival and hopefully HIGHWAY 61 will bring more attention to their films.; The film is quirky and often funny, treating its characters in a
good-natured fashion.; HIGHWAY 61 is, as the title suggests, a road movie, the tale of a
young couple driving from a small town in Ontario down the length of
Highway 61 to New Orleans, 1500 miles to the south.","More importantly, the
nonsense isn't particularly engaging in any way, it's just there.; The main problem is
that the film is too long to sustain itself and begins to plod: the
scene with the drugged-out rock stars for whom Jackie was once a roadie
could have been cut with little loss.; There are also some dissolute ex-rock stars that are friends of the
wild woman, who engage in some degenerate activity that might be mildly
amusing.; First demerit: none of this makes any sense.; In this case, our hero the geek is a barber in Canada who has
pretensions of being a trumpet player (he's awful)."
8487.0,Wild Wild West,2001.0,"A Sonnenfeld interview is
always a hilarious and entertaining freak show spectacular.; There are more enjoyable comic moments in WILD WILD
WEST than I was expecting, thanks to Sonnenfeld's sometimes surreal comic
touch (references to E. T. and the RCA Victor dog).; The pair spark a number of laughs along the way, with plenty
of snappy one-liners and some risque humour.; This is
the way the film struck me.; Watch it with a teenager today.","A bad
movie is a bad movie.; With possibly the worst movie beard ever, Kenneth Branagh shamelessly
overacts as the story's villain, Dr. Arliss Loveless, who is trying to
capture Grant and take over the country.; Smith isn't outrageous here 
because he's doing his same old schtick, which at least works in other movies 
because he had smart dialogue and a good script to work with, here it just 
seems lame.; It's a
sad thing when _four_ (credited) screenwriters, a talented director and a
willing star can't make a film work, and eventually Wild Wild West collapses
under it's sexist, mildly racist, unfunny weight.; This film's
narrative is little more than a jumbled, unfunny mess."
8512.0,Devil in a Blue Dress,1959.0,"Analysis:  I really liked this movie.; The supporting performances,
including a brilliant turn by Don Cheadle as Easy's violent friend, are
strong.; He also does a great job playing the
humor, and there is a lot of humor in this movie, straight so it shines
through.; There were several memorable lines.; Vulnerable and mysterious,
Jennifer Beals (still best known for FLASHDANCE) is effective in the
unlikely role of a femme fatale.","I thought the script by the director Carl Franklin, based on the
novel of the same name by Walter Mosely, was too much of a period and
mood piece and too little of a mystery.; And why would these people hire him to do this?; Perhaps Beals should just sign up to do remakes of FLASHDANCE
for the rest of her life since that is the only decent movie she ever
made.; His
beefy contours and conscious swagger feed the burn, as does his skin,
which viewed through Tak Fujimoto's sandy-colored photography sometimes
looks burnt-orange.; The movie is rated R for
violence, profanity, and sex, but no nudity."
8545.0,Little Voice,1999.0,"But Horrocks is a real gem.; While some viewers might find the harsh,
serious denouement a departure from the more frothy tone of the film,
Little Voice is still a very satisfying experience.; We see snippets of only a couple of her
numbers, but during those few minutes, it's one of the best films of the
year: energetic and sit-up-in-your-seat entertaining.; In fact, looking at the rough outline, it has all the
right ingredients for a terrific Brit import: a great cast (Michael
Caine, Brenda Blethyn, Jim Broadbent, Ewan McGregor, and, of course,
Horrocks), some great humor, a little bit of pathos, and a selling point
that's just superb (in fact, I'd still like to see it again, just for
the big number sequence).; A small, UK feature, Little Voice is a mostly enjoyable film, with a grand
cast, including the mighty Brenda Blethyn, who's performance in 1996's Secrets
& Lies was phenomenal.","Instead he pretty much
goes nowhere for the first half of Little Voice, prolonging the dramatic
scenes until he decides which characters should voice them.; I will not give away the truly awful ending, but I can+t help but
comment on the filmmakers+ apparently schitzophrenic intentions.; It's all the more disappointing because, for most of its running
time, LITTLE VOICE doesn't seem headed that way at all.; Trouble is LV's, as I said, agoraphobic, so she basically has to
be literally forced to do it.; No plot-requiring love
interest."
8649.0,Bringing Out the Dead,2001.0,"Cage's performance as the paramedic is brilliant.; Ving Rames ('Entrapment' ) gives a
brilliant comic performance as the 'holy medic'.; This is a very tough film to honestly say that
you thoroughly enjoyed it, but what's more important than that, is how
it lingers with you for a long time after seeing it and how compelling
it is in a meaningful way.; * * * * - Great flick.; This is a good solid film, but it is a bit hard to really get
into.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; The perpetually
awful assassination thriller `Snake Eyes' was one of 1998's worst films.; * * - Pretty bad.; It just doesn't
work like that.; `8MM' was a disappointing lost cause."
8656.0,Deep Impact,1999.0,"I enjoyed it and the ending was very
satisfying.; Elijah Wood, one of the best child
actors working today, is surprisingly average, although his choice of roles
lately haven't exactly been brilliant (i.e.; This
is a great movie to take your kids too, totally appropriate for all ages, a
good movie for anyone who likes a drama to see, and, if you kind of like
drama and also like a few thrills but can't stand an all out rush, its worth
it too.; This movie has an understated courage
and I liked many of the performances.; DEEP IMPACT begins the official summer movie season, and it also brings back
memories of 1997.","Only one of the
subplots is remotely interesting, while the rest are forgettable and boring.; The script by Michael Tolkin (The Player) and Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost)
fails in one way: It tries to look at the disaster from the viewpoint of
too many characters.; It's a dull role.; ""Oh, it'll come so close it might actually
graze the moon--whoops, sorry, must have gotten a floating point wrong
there.""); What a waste of a convincing performance by Morgan Freeman."
8744.0,Albino Alligator,1995.0,"Dillon is excellent as the torn Dova.; The acting is superb.; There's something darkly 
delightful about watching a movie like this, which, despite occasionally 
falling back on formulaic conventions, still manages to surprise its 
audience from time-to-time.; There are occasions, 
however, when the film's talkiness eats into the tension, especially 
towards the midpoint.; A ""box drama"" of classic design, ALIBINO ALLIGATOR is a
psychological thriller set largely inside a New Orleans Prohibition-era
bar still open in the 1990's.","That is not how the original robbery had been planned
at all.; A better
editing job (especially continuity) could have made a big difference
here as well.; I never did figure out what the
film's title meant.; United States, 1996

8818.0,Evita,1998.0,"In fact watching
Madonna's solid performance as Eva Peron, was perhaps this movie's
greatest surprise.; This
perfectly describes Madonna's performance as EVITA.; Lady Madonna is picture-perfect and, at 
times, vocally impressive as the died-young-after-sleeping-her-way-to-
the-top Argentinean First Lady.; Nevertheless, Pryce plays the thankless role
with note-perfect grace.; Eva Duarte was a wonderful
lady.","She mugs for the camera, but her acting is rarely convincing and her
songs are one disappointment after another.; What the fuss is all about, I have no idea, because EVITA is just
another bad movie starring one of our worst actresses, Madonna.; Okay, it IS a
let-down.; But as a 17-year old Quentin Tarantino fan, it was way too hard.; It doesn't
work for me."
8834.0,Conspiracy Theory,1998.0,"Overall, I'd say this is a film well worth seeing.; When I entered the theatre I was expecting a fairly light
mystery type movie, and came away pleasantly surprised and
somewhat dissappointed at the same time.; Richard Donner keeps you guessing as he confidently spins his tale.; But the 
film has so much else going on, that it somehow works out being fun and 
entertaining, despite its numerous faults.; It's a rare, and quite 
refreshing, treat to watch a Hollywood film and actually be kept off 
guard almost all the way through.","What a waste.; Phew, what a mess!; At over two hours, this
film could have been significantly condensed and had it's running time
shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour, but even then, the action
scenes would not be able to save the film.; Unfortunately, that's about the only thing the film
has going for it: after the film lays down the tracks for a truly
original film with a promising setup, it promptly sinks into
uncompelling, slightly inane generic formulaism.; However, one wishes that Donner and company had remained on that track, for
the film quickly degenerates into a murky mess that grows more hopelessly
convoluted with each passing minute."
8835.0,Legally Blonde,1996.0,"Seldom are lighthearted comedies so smooth and
enjoyable to watch as `Legally Blonde,' a very
palatable comedy that is both cute and funny.; Legally Blonde is a fun summer date movie, a lightweight enjoyable outing that
in its own sneaky way will make you think twice before judging someone merely by
their appearance.; He especially liked
all of the courtroom scenes.; Elle is shocked to find that she now
has a rival.; Witherspoon gives a finely honed performance.","What's worse, Legally Blonde doesn't have a sense of
the ridiculous.; He dumps poor Elle because he needs
someone ""serious,"" even if they have no fashion sense.; In all fairness, maybe Blonde wasn't really even trying to be funny.; Overall, production values are on the cheap side and, like the screenplay, 
shallow.; Hovering
somewhere between outright silliness and heavy-handed
moralizing, the movie never decides where it wants to
go or what it wants to be."
8839.0,Casper,1993.0,"Bill Pullman has been a very solid character actor for many years
and he is good here as well.; For a movie with wonderful special effects and which undoubtedly
cost a bundle, I was surprised at how low budget looking the sets by
Academy Award winner Leslie Dilley were.; Although the story is somewhat disjointed in areas, it works
on the level it needs to.; This eventually leads
to an exceptionally satisfying conclusion late in the film.; All the adults in this movie treat CASPER like the comic book-come-
to-life it is, and give performances for the under-twelve audience.","The intended to be
repulsive other ghosts were that, but they were not particularly
interesting or funny.; which is so awful, it elicited the groans again.; The final
reel is the worst, with enough ghosts, angels, and misplaced spirits to
send even the lowest-level paranormal screaming from the theater.; Worse, the
characters were not developed nor was there any discernible plot.; A couple of scenes could be called, at worst,
tasteless."
8844.0,Jumanji,1996.0,"And funny.; JURASSIC PARK 
showed how amazing computer-generated creatures can be when properly 
handled; JUMANJI shows what happens when less care is given to the 
technology.; I enjoyed JUMANJI well enough, but it was no TOY STORY,
which I consider the best movie of the season, and I really don't see
it as a major classic in years to come.; It is a great mixture of action, humor, special effects,
and poignancy.; This is a film in which many
scenes involving the magic of the game have a very nice look.","Unfortunately, along the way, the film fails miserably at building up any
semblance of suspense (it's pretty obvious how this thing is going to
end), and relies on melodrama to try to make us care about the characters,
resulting in a sloppy, over-dramatic plot that doesn't really get going
for half an hour.; Even the precocious kids are basically annoying.; The special effects are unfortunately not terribly impressive.; I'm sure everyone in the
movie is a capable actor or actress -- it just seems like they go
through the movie not entirely sure what's going on -- and that
unfortunately comes across in the movie.; The movie goes something like this:  someone makes a move, then the 
characters spend the next ten minutes running away from whatever animals 
they unleash."
8845.0,Under Siege,1999.0,"Because this is the Steven Seagal movie
that I like and think is good and enjoyable.; The sets for the
film are excellent and really place the film well.; Jones is great fun here and probably worth the price of a matinee
admission.; This is a well
directed and well put together movie.; The movie is well-done for what it is.","Simply said, this is movie-making by the numbers, boring, and
potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the
audience.; Often, the villain saves the movie; unfortunately, the villains
here are cartoonish, stupid and unfunny, unmenacing.; In these one we are given a two for one package in the
form of a Playboy model (in the movie), which only functions as a
supposed comic relief (by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines),
and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens
in the movie.; There isn't much to say about the writing.; In the first half of the movie, we are already assaulted with
Segal's acting, (he is not simply wooden; he is like a wall), gratuitous
violence, an incredible plot, sexist and even more gratuitous nudity,
and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes."
8860.0,Metro,2001.0,"An enjoyable two hours, Metro is enjoyable, witty, action-packed, and
fun, and makes for a great action movie that's perfect for all of us
that need an escape from reality.; It is hip, sharp, nifty, and has nice little pieces of
suspense and comedy.; The movie's schizophrenia is subtle, but it's there.; The actor that I most enjoyed seeing in ""Metro"" was Michael Rapaport, who
plays Roper s new partner, a lip-reading, book-skimming genius, and a
master of observation.; The film is a triumph, and an entertaining one at
that.","The story was so predictable that I found myself in a time warp,
watching the film ten minutes beyond what was on the screen.; Worst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain
(the always menacing Michael Wincott) behind bars for far too long,
leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of Scott and
Veronica.; You can't blame Murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for
the scenes with his bland leading lady, but he should have known better
than to take this role at all.; My faith, however, was misguided since the script by Randy Feldman
(NOWHERE TO RUN and TANGO & CASH) spends little time in hostage
negotiations.; Even though 1997 has barely begun, I seriously doubt there will be a movie
as atrociously bad this year as ""Metro""."
8870.0,Red Planet,1990.0,"Kudos to director Antony Hoffman and writer 
Chuck Pfarrer for putting together a believable and enjoyable film.; Val Kilmer is excellent as 
Gallagher.; In the best
of all possible worlds, they accomplish both.; I love how Hollywood works.; Some might 
say that it's a bit long or a bit slow, but I thought it was a good solid 
piece of sci-fi moviemaking.","The characters spout dialogue
that alternates between inane exposition and pointless 
self-characterization.; The characters spout dialogue
that alternates between inane exposition and pointless 
self-characterization.; But I suppose much of my disappointment with the film
could've been resolved if they had actually spent some time building an
interesting story or developing their characters, but neither aspect
materializes here.; But at least it only wastes a few minutes of
your time before making that obvious.; But at least it only wastes a few minutes of
your time before making that obvious."
8871.0,How the Grinch Stole Christmas!,1999.0,"With all of this fun and imagination at work, how
could you not love this movie?; It makes for the year's most unique 
performance.; Despite its flaws, this is something you must see.; A true timeless classic this film may not be;
It's simply a package of holiday glee.; I must say,
Carrey's absolutely splendid vocal work on that musical piece pulls together
one of the film's strongest moments.","Ron Howard's dull live-action version is a bland, overstuffed souffle, more likely to make you yawn than laugh.; Secondly, there's the truly awful Whos (makeup again by Rick Baker).; He does his share to encourage anti-Grinch propaganda, 
but is the emerald guy really so bad?; At 102 minutes, director Ron Howard is plowing all over the map with nothing to say.; After one failed attempt at a Grinchy inclusion
In Who celebrations, he's back to seclusion
To plot, as we know, stealing all Christmas treasures
So no one might have any holiday pleasures."
8873.0,Wayne's World 2,2000.0,"Silly, but riotous at times, this is an excellent movie
even better than the original.; It
is great to see Wayne and Garth back in action and in great form.; Overall, the movie has plenty of continuity flaws (especially in
the fight scent between Garth and Cassandra's dad), but these are
easily overlooked as this is, after Wayne's World.; The wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and
fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well
as just a lot of hilarious scenes of Wayne and Garth showing their true
color.; There is lots
of intelligent humor that makes this film special.","Fortunately, film provides few laughs and hour and half
spent in front of the screen doesn't look a total waste of
time.; The storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of
the original, ""guy loses chick, guy realizes mistake, and guy gets
chick back.""; In the final analysis, WAYNE'S WORLD 2 lacks inspiration, and uses
up ninety-five minutes trying to find some.; Other cameos, like Ed O'Neill's, are disappointing, but they
are few.; Christopher
Walken's character is basically a retread of Rob Lowe's from the first
film, but without the campy appeal."
8916.0,Antz,1991.0,"Stallone is also good, and
the teamwork between Allen and Stallone is great, playing each other off
perfectly.; As Z's best friend 
Weaver, Sylvester Stallone is an endearing lug and Sharon Stone does 
solid work as the privileged, but spirited Princess Bala.; In short,
Antz contains everything that makes an excellent film excellent and,
whilst it doesn't completely blow you away, it's probably the best
family movie so far this year (it's only contender being Mouse Hunt).; The rest of the actors are also well-cast:
Sylvester Stallone is perfect fit for Z's musclehead soldier friend,
Weaver; Stone lends Princess Bala sexiness and spunk, as does Jennifer
Lopez to Z's worker friend Azteca; Hackman makes Mandible a hissable
villain; and Christopher Walken is an ideal foil as his right-hand ant,
Colonel Cutter.; Tense at times, and very funny throughout,
the two hold this film together like professionals.","Antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice-overs.; I was very disappointed with Antz.; Hackman's
villain is uninspired and, frankly, two-dimensional, like some reject
from Dreamworks' other military-themed cartoon Small Soldiers.; (Cheap, cheap laughs.); There was
no need to make a nineties version of Animal Farm and the filmmakers got so
busy attempting to add symbolism, they forgot about how weak the actual story
was."
8966.0,Twilight,,"He's great here--Harry is funny and well-written,
and he has a life outside of what we see.; Fortunately, things pick up a little.; Hackman and Sarandon are equally good, and are both given fascinating
characters to embody.; Newman's performance is deep
and sympathetic, and he had me hooked immediately--he plays his part
like a pro.; Jack, who is dying from cancer, is a very flawed
individual, but Hackman elicits our sympathy and makes us like him
despite some of the things he does.","The scene is dry and poorly choreographed, and is plagued by an insipid
and unoriginal music score.; The
subplot involving a delusional man who thinks he is Harry's partner is
intrusive and pointless.; The 90 minutes of
Twilight feel alarmingly brief--they whet our appetites for a main
course that will never arrive.; Much of the dialogue feels forced:  in one
scene, Witherspoon (who plays the Ames' daughter) meets Harry as he is
watching Jack and Catherine cuddle on their bed.; US Distribution:  Paramount
Rated R:  Violence, language, sex By Nathaniel R. Atcheson (nate@pyramid.net) It's not a good sensation to walk away from a film feeling hungry for
more."
8984.0,Disclosure,1997.0,"The three leads in the show are all great and perfectly cast.; Director Barry Levinson keeps this part of the film moving at a very
rapid pace and most of the plot details are revealed in a logical and
believable manner.; The resulting film is somewhat short on meaningful social commentary,
but it is still a fast-paced and extremely entertaining crowd pleaser.; Okay, it was similar to some other parts he has
played, but he was, nevertheless, terrific in his role.; I recommend the movie strongly to adults especially those
who like mysteries because that is what it ultimately turns out to be.","The film is badly miscast.; What was really
supposed to be going on in this film?; Either the direction or the
editing left something seriously missing from this film.; It is supposed to be taking place in a
high-tech company developing virtual reality technology, but no manager
in it is anything like a person who would be involved in such a
company.; The preview for the film gave me the impression that there was
some nifty high tech secret underlying the main plot; this is not
true."
9032.0,Big Daddy,1992.0,"Despite its flaws, it is still very funny and very clever.; Despite a
harsh sounding accent, she delivers a very solid, funny, and romantic
performance as the second love in Sonny's life.; In this cynical age, it's refreshing to see a movie that 
celebrates love, maturity and acceptance of others.; Big Daddy is a very enjoyable movie.; Stewart, in his minor time on screen, is great, and
Adams remains a joy to watch.","One performance carries with
it a ray of light, but the movie is otherwise a waste of time, a waste
of money, and a waste of 35mm film.; Instead, it's purely laughable.; Then, over the next hour and
a half, unrealistic, hard to believe, poorly acted, and technically
deficient scenes run across the screen.; And
the result is a generally lifeless film that Sandler just doesn't have
the talent to save.; The movie, which celebrates bad behavior, will undoubtedly have
audiences composed largely of 9-14 year olds, as was ours."
9061.0,Just Cause,1995.0,"His screen presence is amazing.; Sean Connery is a fascinating and compelling actor.; Eerie.; Eight years
later, Harvard professor Paul Armstrong (Sean Connery) must find the
truth behind the killing and set an innocent man free.; Connery captures 
our sympathy as the relentlessly upright practitioner of the law.","Capshaw is totally
unconvincing, and this link between the two cases is a silly plot
device.; Blair Underwood is positively boring as the
innocent man accused and Kate Capshaw is downright bad as Armstrong's
wife.; In another implausible role, we have Kate Capshaw as Armstrong's
wife Laurie.; Director Arne Glimcher never establishes
exactly what his film is trying to say.; In the Hannibal Lecter role, Harris give either a
brilliant or an excessively ridiculous performance."
9067.0,Tank Girl,1988.0,"The rock-and-rap soundtrack, supervised by Courtney
Love-Cobain, invigorates certain scenes, and blends nicely with the
visuals.; And while a rock and roll soundtrack may have enhanced
your own reading experience, the comic book proved on its own that it
had music in its soul.; It's good fun.; Certainly, this movie isn't art, but it sure is fun.; I especially liked the tank that responds
like ""man's best friend.""","The filmmakers use them any time
there is the possibility for a neat special effect or some potential for
plot development, so they don't waste any money on actually interesting
footage, instead copping out to some goofball crayon scribbling.; And 
lastly, the movie's potential star attraction - namely, the tank -  is badly 
wasted.; In her near-Morticia-like
makeup, this Tank Girl avatar comes across like a 35-year-old trying to
mix in with her 15-year-old daughter's friends, and doing an
embarrassingly bad job of it.; I'll be the first to admit that Tank Girl has absolute zero as far as
redeeming value is concerned.; His support is
terrible, from Ice-T as a mutant kangaroo, to Petty herself, who I was
hoping would get killed by the movie's end."
9089.0,Home for the Holidays,1990.0,"Nor is it really believable that this family lets so much hang out ata
family get-together.; Cast: Holly Hunter, Robert Downey, Jr., Anne Bancroft, Dylan McDermott,
      Charles Durning, Geraldine Chaplin, Steve Guttenberg, Claire Danes,
      Cynthia Stevenson.; There is a good movie contained within HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS which
I suppose is why most of the critics love this show.; Most romantic comedies are about strong, emotionally secure people
finding each other.; In ""Relatives"" we meet Mom's unmarried
sister, retired schoolteacher Geraldine Chaplin.","Who comes in but Leo, with a
ridiculous lamp (don't ask)?; Unfortunately,
this film ends up more like stuffing than meat.; The real point is that this movie is pointless.; Also, so much effort is put into
distancing the audience from the film's population (so the jokes won't
seem too mean-spirited) that when we're required to sympathize with them
for dramatic purposes, it doesn't work.; On the
other hand, Tommy is relentlessly gay in the old sense, ebullient,
bouncy and far, far too cute."
9090.0,"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar",1998.0,"While his
character may not be overly wonderful or impacting, he still put a lot into
it and does a fabulous job, as subtle as it may come off.; The three leads are obviously having a lot of fun, and it shows.; ""Quirky"" doesn't begin to describe the new, long-awaited film TO WONG
FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, JULIE NEWMAR.; And although it borrows heavily
from last year's PRISCILLA:  QUEEN OF THE DESERT, TO WONG FOO is still
quite a bit different and takes cross-dressing into realms I never knew
existed.; Still, it's enjoyable and is worth seeing on video.","Perhaps,
especially with names like Snipes and Swayze in the cast list, but this
might have been a better test if the movie had been less bland.; However, as a whole, this
film--like the broken-down Caddy--may have style, but it lacks
substance.; They're forced to stay the weekend, and obviously become
a conspicuous group of flamboyantly dressed ""women"".; Frequently, when this movie should soar, it crashes
to the ground with a dull thud.; If you've seen any of the
promos for the movie, you probably know the premise:  three drag queens
(Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo) start a cross-country
trek to Hollywood, carting with them their wardrobes and an autographed
picture with the title inscription."
9091.0,Sudden Death,1998.0,"It is wonderful.; It is wonderful.; (Let's face it, if you enjoy this type of film you
realize that in most cases plot is an afterthought at the best of times.); Powers Boothe is great as the villain.; So, relax and roll 
with the punches.","Although I was left asking why
are they wasting my time on this crap?; There's nothing interesting about any of these 
characters, and no real reason to care whether they live or die.; The young actors playing Van Damme's 
children are awful and Raymond J. Barry's Vice President is a walking, 
talking cliche.; Deriving shallow enjoyment from SUDDEN DEATH's poorly-acted, 
extravagantly absurd series of predictable action sequences demands one 
of three characteristics: an irrational fondness for Van Damme, a love 
of stale, artless films, or an unhealthy tendency towards masochistic 
experiences.; (Not even a Van Damme movie.)"
9095.0,Mary Reilly,1978.0,"The way it is done
adds very greatly to the implausibility of the story.; I would list him close to the top of the best actors
working today.; A beautiful film in its own dreary way.; Often the Jekyll and Hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person
into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts.; Roberts and Malkovich are skillful in their roles.","The swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very Tim 
Burton movie, but, alas, no caped crusader descends to save *this* 
film.; On the other hand, I had trouble staying
awake, and I wish I would have walked out so I do not recommend this
extremely s-l-o-w film to anyone.; It may well be
the worst touch in the film.; I give the movie 1/2 of a * only because I've seen worse.; At the thirty minute point, almost nothing had happened save an
ineffective flashback to an abusive period in Mary's childhood."
9096.0,Medicine Man,2000.0,".Technically this is good, thorough and painstaking work.; Well, Bond has done it again,
and his new movie, MEDICINE MAN, is better than a double root canal.; MEDICINE MAN is essentially a two-person show.; It avoids condescension toward the
Amazon Indians and dodges the opposite temptation of romanticizing or
mysticizing them.; MEDICINE MAN (1992) ** 1/4 Cast: Sean Connery, Lorraine Bracco, et al.","These cheap attempts at sex appeal are
so artificial as to be laughable if they weren't so blatantly so
exploitive.; The script is so
inane, it should have been condensed into a one-hour made-for-TV-movie
with commercials instead of being a two-hour slog.; but also boring.; It
is a dumb, dull  scenario that is beyond the curative powers of script
doctors.; The only
thing it has going for it are some nice shots of the Amazon, but nothing at
all besides that."
9099.0,Sgt. Bilko,2000.0,"In the funniest part of the show, Sgt.; The performances, all of them, from big to tiny roles, are 
excellent.; Dan Aykroyd plays beautifully second banana as 
Bilko's bozoid, gullible yet complicitous Colonel.; BILKO is not great art, but I laughed a lot as did the rest of the
audience, and I think you will too so I recommend the film and give the
picture ** 1/2.; The outcome is hilarious.","BILKO -- have varied in quality from mediocre to downright 
awful.; Any 
of the worst original TV scripts contained more innovation and humor 
than this ninety-minute mixture of bad jokes and regurgitated formulas.; In this day and age, it comes off as lame and unnecessary, kind of like 
the real Army.; That includes having Bilko's platoon audited by two 
accountant dorks (including fellow ""SNL"" alum Chris Rock), Hartman 
and Aykroyd popping in for a surprise inspection at the worst possible 
time, Hartman trying to romance Bilko's longsuffering fiance (Glenn 
Headly) and a bunch of crap involving the $70 million hovertank the 
Bilko platoon was supposed to be building.; BILKO isn't a decent comeback vehicle for Martin or 
Aykroyd, who both give mediocre, walk-through performances, but at 
least Hartman shows talent amid the ninety minutes of mindless 
entertainment, most of which is contrived and unoriginal."
9255.0,Hot Shots! Part Deux,1999.0,"Worth a look
at $7.50 prices, certainly worth it for a video night.; My experience with Monty Python
is that the earliest episodes I saw were, and still are, hilarious; episodes
seen later lack that zing.; All in all it works very well, and I laughed a lot.; Other people seem to have shared this
experience: in spite of seeing episodes in a different order, they also find
that what they saw before they became jaded are funny for them, but not so
much what they saw later.; [Trivia answer: Richard Crenna played Walter Denton on radio and
television in ""Our Miss Brooks.""","His character was a dim-witted teenager
who talked as if he had peanut butter on his tonsils.]; There are too many instances
when the film is too obvious in its attempts at humor.; My approach to the problem is periodically to remind people that I am
writing about one person's experience with a film on one viewing--their
mileage with a film may vary.; Plenty of gags about Hussein, none of which are
complimentary.; Perhaps major film critics are able to be
objective about the films they write about, but I doubt even that is true."
9263.0,Now and Then,1958.0,"In a few respects, NOW AND THEN, is much like Rob Reiner's STAND
BY ME.; The
occasion of their reunion is Chrissy's impending blessed event.; The film opens and closes in the modern time frame.; They also learn to trust each 
other and distrust their parents.; First, we get the
climax of MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO amidst the quiet solitude of the
tombstones.","I had some interest in what
happened with the twelve year olds, but I didn't care about them at all
once they had grown up.; Unfortunately, this
sort of personal insight is not the norm for NOW AND THEN's hopelessly
mundane script.; No, it doesn't make sense, but at least it's distracting.; The fine cast, all good
actors, are wasted on an uninteresting story where you find that you do
not really care what happens to them.; While some of the kids look
like they could look something like the grownups they are supposed to
eventually be, Christina Ricci looks nothing like Rosie O'Donnell."
9271.0,Virtuosity,1994.0,"""Virtuosity"" was a very enjoyable film for me to watch,
a definite guilty pleasure.; Despite much violence and
a few scenes that are difficult to believe, it is an
enjoyable and interesting film that is underrated and
worth a look.; Fine technical
credits throughout, including a delightful score that's based on one of
*my* favorite orchestral works, Camille Saint-Saens' ""Symphony No.3 Op
78.""; Still, it is fun watching Crowe camp
it up, and Washington's intensity is compelling.; Russell Crowe
makes a real splash with Sid 6.7, a virtual reality simulation who
comes to life to have his brand of fun with Denzel.","Ultimately, however, he has little to work with in this 
dreary, film-by-numbers flick -- even RICOCHET offered more substance.; If the script actually
allowed these ""professionals"" to eliminate Bullock's character (who
comes across a disk which could foil a corporate conspiracy, if you
really care) as swiftly as they dispatch the other nonessentials, the
movie wouldn't last fifteen minutes.; I realize that every actor makes a mistake or two in choosing
roles, but it must have been clear pretty early what a piece of garbage
this was.; This is a two-dimensional
character you're playing here, so stop that acting nonsense and let's
just shoot the scene and go for a beer.""; The only reason for a distributor to 
hold back such a production is a lack of faith in the picture's ability 
to succeed in the highly-competitive early season, and that's usually an 
indication of a poor movie."
9273.0,Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,1997.0,"The animals are nicely used, especially the adorable monkey and
the raven.; In the first movie, he was always cool, and one step
ahead of every one else--perfect for Carrey's off-the-wall approach.; Ace is distraught after accidentally dropping a racoon into a 
canyon (in a parody of the opening scene of Sylvester Stallone's 
CLIFFHANGER, Jim Carrey being the only person who can make 
Stallone look like a college professor in terms of intellect, or lack of) 
and decides to retire to the mountains of Tibet to gain a higher level of 
consciousness (or, in his case, a level of consciousness).; Those who have been disappointed by Carrey's more restrained roles
in the films following the first ACE VENTURA may be glad to see him
over-acting to the best of his ability, but some may be disappointed by
the fact that this sequel doesn't capture the feel of the original.; ACE VENTURA - WHEN NATURE CALLS: B+, or ***.5 stars The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","I wouldn't suggest seeing this film unless you're either really
bored or really crave that goofy humor.; Instead, his extremely funny manner has been reduced
to just walking around stupidly.; Instead, Carrey just mugs away, playing for the camera even when most
of it isn't funny.; There is no plot to this film.; Far less of the animals is seen than might be expected from
all the hype surrounding them."
9278.0,Freejack,2001.0,"(This is very rare in Media
PA where I saw it; audiences here usually are quiet.); It is well-written, well-acted, and it is good science fiction for
a non-cult-movie.; It's no WAGES OF FEAR but it's good fun, and I would take it over HOOK,
Costner's ROBIN HOOD, TOTAL RECALL, or similar fare any day.; Of course, there
is something of a mystery going on in this future world.; If you are surprised at who is
pulling all the strings, perhaps you deserve this film.","With it's bad acting, poor dialogue, awful screenplay,
horrible characters I find it really hard to say anything good about
this movie.; The screenplay was awful.; Violent,
     ugly, stupid, and boring sci-fi chase film, purported based
     on Robert Sheckley's IMMORTALITY, INC., though actually
     borrowing just an idea or two.; This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made.; Either director Geoff Murphy did not
let Hopkins do much or Hopkins was just simply uninspired."
9279.0,Jingle All the Way,1992.0,"**** Amazing, potent stuff.; It is Ted's job to hit on Howard's wife Liz (Rita Wilson), which,
of course, helps Howard to realize What's Really Important.; - Howard
""THANK YOU!""; And, of course, Howard walks away from his experiences having learned
What's Really Important.; >From devilish Santa Claus con men to a sadistic reindeer to a climax which
puts Arnold in Turbo Man's shoes, this is a sheer feel good and hilarious
film which had me laughing in all the right places and offers some
touching moments as well.","Ridiculous.; Another problem with JINGLE ALL THE WAY is the premise, which lacks 
the substance and comic potential to form the basis of a feature-length 
movie.; Winning in the category for worst advice given in any kid's movie
this year is that by Ted's son to Jamie.; While all the misery is unfolding on the screen, the music is
playing happy tunes like ""I'll be Home for Christmas"" to remind you
that this is supposed to be a comedy.; Hartman was an asset to ""Saturday Night Live,"" and
continues to be one to ""Newsradio"" and ""The Simpsons,"" but, on the big
screen, he's playing the obnoxious sleazy guy far too often, and when he
does it, he's just that - obnoxious."
9283.0,Beautiful Girls,1982.0,"It's
quite refreshing.; ""Beautiful Girls"" is a humorous, funny, and touching film.; Finally, there are great visuals.; **** Amazing, potent stuff.; It
questions, even mocks, traditional male attitudes towards sex and
love and relationships; but it does so gently, with understanding
and sympathy and good humor.","With better editing (Jeffrey Wolf) and directing (Ted Demme)
the movie could have survived the script, but alas it was not to be.; The entanglements of the some 17 major cast members could fill pages
and would spoil the film.; Writer Scott Rosenberg makes a critical error by letting too many
of the male characters *exhibit* the very behaviors that they (and the
film) are attempting to reflect upon.; Why don't they shut up about their feelings
and go shoot something?; One of the least interesting roles is that of Gina Barrisano
(Rosie O'Donnell)."
9285.0,Road Trip,2000.0,"""Road Trip"" is fitfully funny and at times, surprisingly sweet-tempered.; It's very
funny actually.; It's funny as heck, it's
got a great, hip soundtrack and it moves along at a quickity-quick pace.; Breckin Meyer (""Go"") does a great job as the one fairly
normal guy in the film.; I thoroughly enjoyed ""Road Trip"" it has a few flaws here and there, but its
raunchy and funny, and in the end a sweet love story that we actually get
involved in.","Only it's just not all that funny.; Scott's E.L. is
basically _American_Pie_'s obnoxious Stifler with more screen time; the
character of Rubin is nondescript and Costanzo personality-free; Qualls
fails to command any sympathy as the token nerd.; Either Phillips (who also wrote the screenplay) can't write
college dialogue, or the actors didn't know how to work with the
material.; He looks to be over six feet tall, and appears
to weigh less than one hundred pounds.; Josh is a bland rendition of ""typical college
guy."""
9294.0,Phenomenon,1996.0,"**** Amazing, potent stuff.; All in all, PHENOMENON is a great film that made me feel good to be alive.; The impressive cast all give great performances in this film.; Phenomenon is not as satisfying or enjoyable as a Ghost or a Gump,
but it certainly has its charms, and that may very well be enough to insure
its place among the top box office grossers of the summer.; He is one of those stars who is instantly likable
from frame one, and he is put to ideal use here--funny, sweet, with a good
sense of self-aware humor.","Instead, it's just...; Many the reviews I've read for this film say that the film suddenly takes a
turn for the worst in the final half hour.; *  It
just goes on and on and never does much of anything.; These ""extra"" dramatics are hideous, entirely
unnecessary, *and* suggest that neither the director nor the writer had
any idea about how to end this movie.; The latter was an example of the worst kind, the kind of
film whose sole purpose seems to be to make us feel better about ourselves
for being so much more understanding than the oppressive, narrow-minded
cowards in the film."
9300.0,Orlando,1997.0,"A perfect union of sound and image, the film boasts an
amazing soundtrack.; And
for once, their music gets a chance to be noticed, and appreciated.; This may not be one of the best films ever done.; As it is, it is a very nice film, but a real freak of the
nature of film.; Swinton gives a masterful performance, displaying amazing range as
both a man and a woman.","Not the
fantasy premise of the deathless person moving through the ages or even the
changing of sex, but for the idea that Orlando could have lived so long and
apparently remained so vapid and lacking in insight.; And fails again.; Other than Orlando, there is no character that is around for more
than about 15 or 20 minutes.; Even on its own terms,
the storyline of this film is weak and riddled with contrivances,
questions, and problems.; The sad thing is that this film can never be considered good, unless you are
a literary minded person, who might just appreciate what SHOULD be
considered, an experiment in the exercise of writing."
9303.0,Bound,1998.0,"BOUND 
is among the best film noir entries of the decade; from beginning to 
end, it's solidly entertaining.; I had a
great time watching the plot's twists and turns so I recommend this
movie although granted it is not for everyone, and I award it ***.; From a stylistic perspective, this is a beautiful film -- a color 
motion picture with black-and-white sensibilities (as is often true of 
the best modern film noir).; A
great edge-of-your seat thriller the keeps the adrenaline flowing.; But thanks to a clever
script, strong performances, and very accomplished direction, Bound is one
of the year's biggest surprises.","Not seeing this film would have been one of the worst mistakes of my life.; Writers-directors Larry and Andy
Wachowski's only other major credit was for writing Richard Donner's
entertaining but overblown Assassins; lead Jennifer Tilly has a tendency to
be grating, to say the least; and co-star Gina Gershon was just coming off
her overwrought camp queen turn in Showgirls.; From the first scene, however, it's obvious 
that the writing/directing team of Andy and Larry Wachowski are aiming 
for something considerably higher than rudimentary titillation.; I thought my low expectations were being met during the film's first
twenty minutes, in which mafia moll Violet (Tilly) tries to seduce the
lesbian grease monkey ex-con (Gershon) next door.; An odd thing was the acting of Ceasar (sic) who seemed to
be doing an imitation of Jack Nicholson right down to the whites in
his eyeballs whenever he looked upward, a distinct Nicholson
affectation."
9304.0,Multiplicity,1998.0,"Nevertheless, this is one funny movie.; MULTIPLICITY, while far from a
great comedy, did provide this critic with a lot of laughs and made for
a thoroughly enjoyable time at the movies.; The acting by Michael Keaton is excellent albeit not as good as
some of his performances.; MULTIPLICITY is always about the farce of several Doug Kinneys getting
each other into trouble, and the fact that it works so well and so often
shows how artfully Ramis is able to execute that farce.; The procedure is a success,
and Doug #1 finds himself able to enjoy life more as #2 takes over his
job responsibilities.","Unfortunately,
its attempts at a message get rather muddled.; Twenty minutes are wasted there.; Doug (Keaton) is a construction contractor with way to much
responsibility at work and not enough time to do it.; MacDowell does nothing much for the film other than look as if she is
about to cry during every minute she's on screen.; But I found the most interesting part of the movie's premise painfully
avoided, and I'll ask it here for the reader to ponder:  Just how much
*does* it cost to get a clone?"
9308.0,High School High,2001.0,"HIGH SCHOOL HIGH is Jon Lovitz's first starring role, 
which is the funniest thing about the movie.; Even though it seems more parody movies are being 
released than ever, the well is quickly drying up.; What we do not need is a movie that lays it on in thick globs that
demean everyone.; What made this great comedy even more enjoyable, were the plush,
reclining seats at the new Magic Theater in the Northampton Crossings.; Also, the
soundtrack of the film is comprised of real rap songs.","It's ridiculous.; DANGEROUS MINDS was pretty laughable, but HIGH 
SCHOOL HIGH as an offshoot of that is infinitely whackier.; Put simply, HIGH 
SCHOOL HIGH isn't just bad, it's very bad.; In addition it is a boring film.; I suspect this is not because the
writers aren't funny, but because they were trying to hard to stick to the
plot of the film!"
9311.0,Smilla's Sense of Snow,1998.0,"As preposterous and ponderous as the story can be, it has great
atmosphere and one excellent performance.; Intense situations = very intense
music.; Julia Ormond may be a bit young for Hoeg's Smilla, but she makes the
character her own with an unapologetic toughness uncommon in female screen
characters.; Smilla is a very good female role.; The things to reccomend about this film are the bleak and unerrving 
atmosphere that is sustained throughout the entire film, the way that 
the film pieces the mystery together as the protagonist pieces them, and 
the fantastic, Oscar-nomination worthy acting job done by Julia Ormond.","Though the movie is downhill only
during the second half, they could surely have thought of something
better?; Stupid!; Most disappointing of all, however, is Gabriel Byrne, who seems ill-
suited for his role as Smilla's sidekick.; But this movie isn't bad just because of a poor translation from page to
screen.; In a book, our imaginations would tell us it's much more, but
visually, it's a big let-down."
9312.0,Mortal Kombat,1998.0,"But Rayden does an excellent job with a
voice that matches perfectly.; ), but it's one
of the best made -- certainly one of the best-looking -- and a ton of
lowbrow fun.; Overall, this is a great fight film.; He needs a
great number of souls from great warriors to open the portal between the
earth realm and the dark realm so Shao Kahn, the Emperor of the dark realm,
can come to this dimension.; The best of the best come to fight, and if ""we""
(meaning Earth) wins, the world doesn't get overrun by evil for another
generation.","There were some bits that could
have used some refining, and the character of Sonja was poorly
developed.; Sonya Blade tries to be convincing as a woman who is
self-dependent but fails.; Goro is a special effects reject with a ridiculous voice.; I've always felt the reason that such movies
fared poorly was the lack of background information on which to build a
successful movie.; Goro was entirely computer generated as every four armed badass
should be, but he wasn't utilized to his full potential."
9314.0,Nineteen Eighty-Four,1997.0,"The film is based on George Orwell's novel and it does an excellent job of
capturing the dark mood of the extremely oppressive government where everyone
must work ""for the common good"" and free will and free thinking is not
allowed.; Burton gives a cold, but powerful
performance as O'Brien as he speaks of the establishment in ways that should
be thought-provoking, but seem little more than fascist/sci-fi moviespeak.; And John Hurt and Richard Burton are fabulous in 
their respective parts.; ""1984"" the film works because it wonderfully embodies the bleakness that 
was the book.; But 
the message is still there and that's what counts.","Radford is obviously trying to set up plot and theme through surrealism, but
it doesn't work because all the details seem to be implied.; It's a frightening idea and pretty much illustrates that 
""Give Peace a Chance"" might be a bad idea.; Michael Radford (director of ""Il Postino"") directed this film, 
ironically made in 1984 within the dates the book took place.; There isn't much dialogue, so we learn about
the setting through Winston's thoughts, which sound so vague and overly
written they don't make much sense.; When a film is based on a famous novel, the filmmakers often make the
mistake of assuming the viewer is familiar with the material and thus don't
provide necessary details."
9322.0,Nikita,2000.0,"Overall, a very good movie.; So, we have come full cycle, and Nikita has developed an appreciation
for life that she never had before, leaving us with much moral fodder to
chew on, more than most actioners leave us with, and we come to the
understanding that this incredible story, that is hardly plausible, that
is seemingly cartoonish, is much better than it appears on surface
because somehow or other it satisfies our need to know something about
covert operations and the people who go into it on a non-voluntary
basis, plus the movie is very entertaining and was able to hold our
attention, even through the rough spots in it.; As we
can easily surmise, she proves herself fit for her assignment, and the
big event will climax on how she will fare on her first job.; The actress who portrays Nikita (Anne Parillaud) is
excellent.; An exciting and entertaining actioner that tests the plausibility of its
story with an unreality check, yet is real on its emotional levels,
testing the heroine's reactions to love, guilt, loss of identity, and a
deprived upbringing, which is rare for this genre to be so concerned
with actual human values.","Maybe they even arrange the purported death, and then they train this
""zombie"" to be their agent.; Given the storyline of the film, I was concerned that it might turn
into a ""woman exploited by big, bad guys"" story.; Synopsis:
Nikita, a violent young woman with a drug problem, is sent to prison.; There is no real resolution, and the denouement, such as it is, is
particularly weak.; Perhaps the French government does
have assassins on the payroll, but they wouldn't recruit feral
killers for the job."
9331.0,Clear and Present Danger,2001.0,"Balance between cerebral and physical action is
very well done.; ***  = Excellent show.; I
think teenagers will love this show as did I.  I highly recommend it
and award it *** 1/2.; Moreover, watching Ford down the President like it was his job was
well worth the $6.50.; This is not
one of Ford's best movies, but I would say it is worth the 8 bucks to
go see it since it is fit for the big screen, and it is a nice lengthy
entertaining yet complicated movie.","*    = Poor show.; 0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.; 3 hours would have been a better compromise I think, but then again, I
am not a multimillionaire movie mogul so why should they take my
advice.; I spent half the
movie wondering if this guy was ever going to show anything to mark him
as vaguely human.; Too bad that everything is played way-too-straight."
9333.0,Last Man Standing,1998.0,"I maintain that LAST MAN STANDING is, despite a lackluster plot, an
entertaining and enjoyable movie experience.; It also shows that Kurosawa and
Leone knew better what to do with that material than Hammett himself.; Although the film is not among the best of the year, or even
the best of the movies currently in theatres, it provides suitable
entertainment for its running time.; LAST MAN STANDING contained some excellent stunts as well.; He plays each gang to his best advantage,
swapping from side to side until he develops a handy conscience towards
the end of the movie; that's if helping two dames and killing everyone
else, can be considered developing a conscience?","""Last Man
Standing"" has no drama, no humor, no suspense, no romance, and no action
(unless you consider action to be short bursts of gunfire every 35 minutes).; I
have no idea who writer/director Walter Hill was targeting here.; Both the music and sound are passable efforts helping to save the film
from being below average.; He has maybe ten lines of dialogue and no more
than fifteen minutes of screen time.; Out of all the characters presented in the film, not one is even remotely
interesting or likable."
9344.0,Kids,1996.0,"Great theme music, tho.; It's admirable that the film
avoids moralizing, and that it is frank, brutal, and honest.; Premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah, it
provoked a hailstorm of accolades from critics who latched onto its
uncompromising style and raw vision of (mostly) white urban American
youth.; It's been called ""a masterpiece,"" "" a wake-up call
to the world,"" and even received two thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert.; This is the only feature of 1995 I have seen that offers not only
believable characters and setting, but a believable story with a real
ending.","It's uncomfortable to watch in the worst
way, and unentertaining in the most annoying way.; It's a boring, uncomfortable, one-dimensional
film.; (And poorly filmed at that.); What comes out, however, is a pointless, meandering mess.; Telly is nothing but a one-dimensional idiot."
9350.0,Cliffhanger,1996.0,"Sylvester Stallone is back in a pure action, non-comedy role.; Most of the stunt sequences in this movie are
amazing, and well worth the price of admission.; CLIFFHANGER is the new ""comeback"" film for Sylvester Stallone, a
high-altitude adventure taking place mostly on snowy (Rocky?); As long as the hijacking is in progress, the film seems fresh,
fun, and original.; Stallone is ... well, Stallone.","His fake
English accent is the worst since Keanu Reave's in BRAM STOKER'S
DRACULA.; Bad dialogue abounds, as does lame acting.; It's too bad, some good characters, some good writing, and this
could have been a tremendous film.; On the other hand, STOP OR MY MOM WILL SHOOT is
reputedly just awful.; However, the role is woefully underplayed and
Lithgow's Qualen becomes the least-hated member of his group of thugs
and mercenaries."
9354.0,"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids",1997.0,"One of the fine delights is the
soundtrack, which has that precise timing and calculation of the soundtracks to
the best Warner Brothers cartoons (and which in fact steals its main theme from
those soundtracks).; This is a little, corny, fairy-cake movie, not far removed from a
Disney Sunday Movie, based on an old format, built on a familiar premise; what
makes it work is that almost everything in it is done *right* -- and that fact
is the greatest pleasure in the entire thing.; What
is needed to do the sets correctly is a great deal of craft labor, so
filming in Mexico City's Churubusco Studios were labor is plentiful was a
very intelligent decision.; Of particular note are the flight of the bumblebee -- an exciting addition to
the traditional buttercups-as-beanstalks scenario -- and the exploding droplets
of water from the lawn sprinklers.; And, except for the demise of an endearing
ant, the film keeps everything in perspective and is amusing and light-hearted
throughout.","The image of Moranis and Strassman dangling from a clothes line
with binoculars trained on the grass is a particularly silly one.; Frewer, desperately trying to
shake off his image of television's Max Headroom, is suitably gawky in the role
of Big Russ Thompson.; Absent-minded professor Wayne Stylinski (Rick Moranis) is working in his
attic on a device to shrink things down to microscopic size.; The parents are modern
parents -- I couldn't imagine watching a mom in Walt's lifetime realizing that
her pretty teenage girl is lost along with a flakey teenage boy and muttering
in apprehension:  ""They *better* behave themselves!""; (I
couldn't even have the satisfaction of reviewing these movies, since everyone
is going to see them anyway and all I would accomplish by writing reviews is to
enmesh myself in time-consuming arguments.)"
9359.0,Maverick,1994.0,"This is an enjoyable motion picture, and a good start to the 1994 summer 
season.; Donner has a great deal of fun incorporating parodies of past movies 
into this one.; Granted she was always trying to
outwit and cheat Maverick, but on the surface she had this wonderful
sweet smile.; Western fans would be
additionally satisfied because MAVERICK with its light
spirit is rather refreshing addition to the rejuvenated
genre, represented with dark, depressive and revisionist
films of the early 1990s.; For 
big-budget summer films, from which more and more is demanded, this is 
becoming an increasingly-difficult task - so it's refreshing to find 
something that satisfies expectations.","The man can make a movie, no 
question, but he lacks the precision to punch-up a standard set-piece 
like a runaway stage.; Any word or deed of substance
would be ridiculous after that, and, mercifully, none is forthcoming.; Last year's WILD WILD WEST is something unforgivable and
unjustifiable, but at least in the beginning it might have
looked like a good idea.; MAVERICK features gun fights, fist fights, an attempted hanging, and 
a tete-a-tete with rattlesnakes - but none of these sequences are graphic 
or gory.; Between laughs there were long periods of boredom."
9360.0,Anaconda,1995.0,"Like its great
predecessor, ""Tremors,"" ""Anaconda"" is a tongue-in-cheek bit of fun
scariness that is pretty much guaranteed to entertain as long as you
don't think about it.; Voigt's an Oscar Winner, and one of the best actors of
his generation (see ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Coming Home,"" as well as his
other river flick, ""Deliverence""), and its hilarious to see him go full
ham on us.; Just to see him smile at Jennifer Lopez cunningly is well
worth the price of admission.; On its own level -- thanks to some
hilariously ghoulish special effects -- it's actually something of a
guilty pleasure.; Starring Jennifer Lopez; Ice Cube; Jon Voight; Eric Stoltz & Jonathan Hyde OK, so Anaconda is not going to go down in history as the greatest film ever
made.","Most bad characters are either annoying or stupid.; Absolutely ridiculous.; It becomes even worse when the special
effects stink.; In some scenes the stupid snake looks so bad that you would
think that they had a bunch of 5 year olds with a pack of crayons doing the
animation.; Even the special effects don't pass muster."
9366.0,Donnie Brasco,1996.0,"Depp is excellent as Pistone/Brasco, as he slowly
loses the psychological boundary between the two.; It's an excellent movie, and it really looks good, too.; I highly
recommend the film to you and give it *** 1/2.; A well developed subplot deals with the difficulties of Donnie's
home life and tells this part of the story with a realism I have not
seen before.; Some eyebrows were raised when he was chosen to make this movie, so
different from his familiar, romantic works.","Inexplicably, Lefty's Horatio
Alger inspired gush is supposed to move us.; Where other films have made mob life seem terribly
attractive and glamorous, DONNIE BRASCO shows it as petty and tedious.; It is not even particularly subtly done.; His character is really a pathetic
example of a life wasted.; There just is not enough of
Joe Pistone to be two people."
9374.0,Death Becomes Her,2000.0,"DEATH almost succeeds in its aspirations, never quite
going over the top, but it works as entertainment; it is bold,
inventive, chance-taking, and a lot of fun.; It's better than most of the
other big-budget movies to come out in 1992; there are no real flaws to
spoil the audience's entertainment.; Meryl Streep's
performance is great, as she threatens to go over the top into comic
farce but in fact remains firmly in control; Goldie Hawn easily holds
her own and balances the movie nicely.; Of course, no small amount of the fun arises from the amazing,
seamless special effects.; DEATH BECOMES HER is good summer fare--despite its morbid subject,
it's actually a very light-hearted comedy.","A total waste of talent.; ""A script?; Screw the script!; The same creative team which brought us the Back To The
Future trilogy and Forrest Gump must have really been bored one day and
half-assedly thought of the idea for this garbage.; Let's call the special effects team!"
9377.0,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,2001.0,"It's very funny, original,
well written, and well acted.; This movie captures that essence all the while being a mainstream
comedy and a hysterical one at that.; It's not preachy in terms of symbolism, but its
style is so brilliant it's in a class all its own.; Rooney is somewhat of the cliche anal-retentive administrator, but
the atmosphere of the film is so zany and satirical even the typical elements
seem fresh.; Ferris has a kind of psychological
control over Cameron and when he tells him to pick him up Cameron refuses,
but then guilt trips himself into going along with Ferris.","Hughes eventually weaned himself
off directing and turned to writing-producing instead.; But hes just too infallible.; Other than to infuriate his sister (Jennifer Grey) there
is no real purpose for this hero-worship that I can find.; They take Cameron's father's Ferrari essentially to add to the risk.; Basically, Chicago high schooler Ferris (Matthew Broderick) decides to
skip an exam and takes his two best friends Cameron (Alan Ruck) and
Sloane (Mia Sara, who has nothing to do in her role) along for the
ride."
9383.0,Hollow Man,1949.0,"It really is 
surprisingly a good horror movie, with a great cast and great special effects.; The visuals here are
flawless and delightful.; For those who stay the movie is great fun.; She brings out her character very 
well, and adds yet another good performance to her record.; To round off the 
cast Josh Brolin does a great performance as well, but seems a bit held back 
in his role.","That would be boring.; Laughable,
actually.; The dialogue up till the 
last half hour was at least tolerable if not good, but it falls flat on its 
face and becomes downright painful during that excruciating segment of the 
film.; ""Hollow Man"" runs far too long at 114 minutes.; HOLLOW 
MAN's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist Linda 
(Elizabeth Shue, acting as if she were Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm) and her 
lover, a hunk of beef scientist played by Josh Brolin who's saddled with the 
film's worst lines (""I've lost cohesion again!"")."
9390.0,Jerry Maguire,1996.0,"Overall JERRY
MAGUIRE is an enjoyable film, but far from a memorable one.; He is simply hilarious, and the
affection between him and Cruise makes for some priceless moments.; This is definitely another great film for Cruise, as he turns in a
heart-felt performance.; In smaller roles, Jay Mohr,
Regina King, and Todd Louiso are great.; Crowe and Cruise make an excellent team, yes, but they are not
what make Jerry Maguire such a fantastic movie.","This is a pointless subplot
that only serves to stop what is otherwise a high energy movie.; Easily the worst part of the picture is the divorced women's group
that meets regularly at Laurel's house.; In fact, I
almost said ""skip this movie"" all together.; It tries to be the
emergence of indie fare into big budget fare, but just fails in the
end.; She's
another in a long line of blonde waif-like, pouty-lipped women who are
supposed to be wives and mothers, but who look like they are
high-schoolers."
9397.0,Evolution,2001.0,"This is a simple movie, with sci-fi and comedic 
elements mixed within a little story and great performances.; Even more exciting is the fact that they reproduce at a fantastic rate!; David Duchovny (2000's ""Return to Me"") toplines the film as Ira 
Kane, a science professor who once worked with the government, and he's a 
genuine bore.; David Duchovny (2000's ""Return to Me"") toplines the film as Ira 
Kane, a science professor who once worked with the government, and he's a 
genuine bore.; As for performances, Duchvony and Jones make a delightful pair
and Moore is lots of fun to watch - nice to see her handle comedy for a
change in contrast with her dramatic roles.","Other than that, Scott seems 
unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him.; The problem with ""Evolution"" stems from trying to force the comedy into the 
original sci-fi drama developed by Don Jakoby.; A shame, then, that it all deteriorates into such a 
hopelessly unfunny morass.; Not helping matters is that the entire first half is slow and 
generally monotonous, as tension escalates--to nothing.; Not helping matters is that the entire first half is slow and 
generally monotonous, as tension escalates--to nothing."
9398.0,Zoolander,1997.0,"It's timely, hilarious, good fun.; Much like the Austin Powers films, Zoolander relies heavily on the
strength of the talent involved, and this zany comedy features some of

hysterically, 2001: A Space Odyssey).; Reviewed by Harvey Karten

 Screened at: Kips Bay, NYC 9/29/01 We wear clothes not only to keep warm and preserve our
modesty but to make a statement.; Starring Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Will
Ferrell, Christine Taylor, Milla Jovovich, Jerry Stiller and Jon Voight.","Perhaps its subject matter is
simply too obvious and the jokes simply not funny enough.; The most disappointing thing about Stiller's
film, however, is that all it appears to be saying is that male models
don't seem to have a lot between the ears.; Most of Zoolander's laughs come at the expense of male models, but the
film's biggest gag might be its attempt to push Stiller (who's practically a
chimp) and Wilson (who has the worst nose in Hollywood) as the cream of the
world's modeling crop.; Making a movie that's stupid fun must be really hard since most filmmakers that
try end up with a picture that's merely stupid.; ""Zoolander"" 
just doesn't have enough going for it beyond the 
dumb-as-nails/narcissism angle."
9400.0,Set It Off,1994.0,"Pinkett is backed by a solid cast, and the chemistry between the 
performers helps us believe that there's a real friendship going on.; Jada Pinkett (THE NUTTY PROFESSOR) is one of the crop of fine young 
actresses working today, and she deservedly gets more screen time than 
her co-stars.; The remainder of the film, which 
includes several high-adrenaline action sequences and some slower, more 
dramatic moments, is smoothly-crafted.; Rap artist-turned-actress Queen Latifa brings a toughness to her role 
that recalls blaxploitation star Pam Grier.; And, although the 
marketing for SET IT OFF is geared primarily towards African Americans, 
you don't have to be black to appreciate this effective, in-your-face 
style of film making.","Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier's manipulative script tries to
make you care for the hard working members from the projects, but it
overstates its case so badly that it loses most of its credibility.; SET IT OFF runs a full 2:00 for no good reason.; SET IT OFF is a warmed over THELMA AND LOUISE story full of
cliched racial stereotypes.; These women have real problems, but
director F. Gary Gray goes for exploitation so much that the audience
is left with only the action to enjoy.; One woman in the picture, for
example, they say clearly doesn't wash any dishes."
9401.0,2 Days in the Valley,1999.0,"His relationship with his dog makes for one of the most touching scenes I
have seen this year, as his life is saved quite literally by the love of
his pet, and Mazursky's puffy, defeated demeanor is perfect.; The acting is excellent.; **** Amazing, potent stuff.; Although
I thought the picture was weird when it began, I soon got into its
rhythms and loved it.; By midway you have learned the mystery's answer, but by then you
are wrapped up in the story and must know how all of the mini-dramas
that have burst forth will be resolved.","Not even
Charlize Theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again.; Two days isn't a bad movie but there isn't much else to it than the
screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters.; This is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast
members should rent, and even then prepare for disappointment.; While it tries very hard to be
Pulp Fiction, 2 Days In The Valley falls way short.; When he says: ""For me the entire movie is about
redemption--how someone can save  another person, and thereby save
themselves"" he is merely spouting pretentious hokum by trying to add a
subtext to a film that is all surface."
9407.0,Red Corner,1993.0,"The casting for the main characters is really well done,
especially in Bai Ling's case.; The film made sure that we
saw some of the strengths in their system, while simultaneously
demonstrating the real weaknesses that remain in ours.; As a
whole the movie is worth seeing and it is good thoughtful
entertainment.; These scenes include everything
you would find in a typical made-for-TV court movie, including the surprise
witness, the surprise revelation by the accused, and the real killer
spilling his guts on the stand after a strong questioning session with the
lawyers.; Granted, I recently saw
RETURN TO PARADISE (7.5/10) set in Malaysia, which was much more
original and gripping.","Pull almost any word 
out of a negative pool of adjectives and you'll have an accurate 
description of RED CORNER:  dumb, boring, painful, laughable, idiotic, 
moronic, inane, bad, etc.; He vacillates 
between scenery-chewing and wooden displays that would make Steven 
Seagal proud, and his delivery of Robert King and Ron Koslow's ripe 
dialogue is often so overwrought that it's impossible to stifle a 
snicker.; Richard Gere's outspoken disapproval for Red China is the main motivation
behind RED CORNER, but making a bad movie to portray ""bad"" government is a bad
idea all around.; Another problem with Red Corner is the uninspired script.; Bad sign."
9413.0,Picture Perfect,1999.0,"Picture Perfect  * 1/2 .; PICTURE PERFECT -- a film review by Justin K. Siegel Of course I knew this going in.; Aniston has good
comic timing, and it shows in Picture Perfect.; If you have time, catch
Picture Perfect on video, but it's a definite skip for seeing in the theatres.; This formula for a genre was discovered by Stanley Cavell and is
detailed in his book PURSUITS OF HAPPINESS.","The
dialogue is flat, boring, uninteresting.; I'm not sure who the costume designer was, or if there even was one, but
the outfits that Aniston wears during the film are horrible.; And I'm not
the type to talk about outfits either, but these dresses were completely
awful.; Every plot occurrence can be spotted a mile away, including a
couple that really made no sense.; There are a few scenes which are endearing, but not
enough to carry the entire movie."
9417.0,Wrongfully Accused,2001.0,"And, it is
fun to study the wonderful props that are used.; WRONGFULLY ACCUSED
(Warner Bros.)
Starring:  Leslie Nielsen, Richard Crenna, Melinda McGraw, Kelly LeBrock,
Aaron Pearl, Michael York.; It shows!; They let the inner child go free, let us
have fun, and let us laugh.; Nice touch.",">From there, however, it's a drop-off into a limp and lame graveyard of
meaningless jokes and unfunny plot developments.; It's not worth my time, or anyone else's, to sit through a dumb
90-minute comedy that will have you laughing for twenty-five seconds.; He's also being
chased by a U.S. Marshall; Richard Crenna has this role, and fails
miserably in mocking Tommy Lee Jones to any degree of funniness.; See,
it just isn't funny.; Proft tries to keep the gags
coming fast enough to obscure the tedium -- perhaps believing he can
convince an audience that a hundred lame jokes add up to one decent one --
but the gags are worse than uninspired."
9430.0,Go,1999.0,"These three tales, as well as several enjoyable and well-written 
subplots, one in which involves the unexpected romantic coupling of 
good-girl Claire and the shady Todd, all inevitably careen and cross 
paths with each other by the film's end, but many of the plot 
developments really are genuinely surprising and satisfying.; Hilarious.; Hilarious.; ""Go"" is an entertaining ride, a wild, kinetic experience that is most
satisfying.; It's a crazy film that will keep you on edge -
funny, energetic, joyous, jolting, ironic, and tense.","No doubt the filmmakers
intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him, but
instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying.; The real
problem is that Liman presents the material with such hip sarcasm that I
found it impossible to invest any kind of true feeling for the
characters.; It succeeds somewhat in doing so and the performances in the film are good
but the rest of the film and its attempt to put forward an original idea
just isn't there and the film comes off as aloof and totally forgettable.; I did not Polley's acting.; 100 minutes.R."
9434.0,Grosse Pointe Blank,1999.0,"This makes for a fun movie that is 
enjoyable and well worth the money to see.; Arkin gives a 
wonderfully off-beat performance.; It's a bit of
fluff, but it's a lot of fun.; But with 
a little convincing from his office manager (Joan Cusack) and his fearful 
therapist (Alan Arkin), he agrees to do the hit job and to attend the reunion.; This is by far one of the most original, hilarious, quirky, well written
comedies I've seen this year.","Unfortunately that's Minnie Driver's only good scene.; Whenever any of that plays out onscreen, the movie turns 
mediocre.; The pacing is choppy and 
erratic, possibly as the result of a poor editing job (the four credited 
screenwriters could also have something to do with it).; It's not worth my time.; Editing,
cinematography, and continuity are all just plain bad, and together they
give the impression of an amateurish rush job, despite the fact that the
film is already dated (taking place in 1996)."
9437.0,Kiss the Girls,1997.0,"But overall, it still works
as an effective thriller with some thrills, a couple of chills, and a
good night of fun stuff!; Morgan Freeman is one of today's most powerful and
believable actors.; This is
because of the great performances by the two leads.; Judd adds yet another great performance
to her list of great performances.; The showdown between good and
evil was quite tense, and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer.","While it's bad enough that
   the screenplay by Mr. Klass is so by-the-numbers, what's even worse
   is the lack of interesting or inventive dialogue to buoy the film; in
   every aspect, this is a remarkably bland script.; Also, the plot did contain many holes, the ending was
weak, and Elwes' Southern accent was awful.; Poor guy.; Maybe the novel was a stinker to
start with, but whatever the case, it's the writing that's clearly at
fault here.; Three, while the notion of a psycho's victims being smart, successful
women is an interesting twist, the execution isn't even half as good
as the idea."
9438.0,Mr. Magoo,1996.0,"Mr. Magoo gets it and, of course, does
not realize he has it.; Angus
demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of
the humans in the picture.; The ReelViews web site: http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/ ""No art passes our conscience in the way film does, and goes directly to our
feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls"" The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Tong, a 
Hong Kong film maker trying to break into the Hollywood market, has 
helmed several Jackie Chan movies, including FIRST STRIKE, RUMBLE IN THE 
BRONX, and SUPERCOP.; My son Jeffrey, age 8, said he thought the movie was good and
really funny, but recommends you not choose it if you want an action
movie.","The worst, MR. MAGOO, exposes just how painful a bad 
movie experience can be.; Like HOME ALONE 3 but without any class, MR. MAGOO can only be
described as painfully bad.; MR. MAGOO is not just an insult to the blind 
and near-blind, it's an insult to every human being who has the 
misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny, 90 minute 
atrocity.; The movie's humor is pathetically lame, and the pacing is
way off.; The first problem with MR. MAGOO is the script."
9442.0,Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid,1981.0,"The more familiar moments (e.g.; For the most part, 
the clips have also been well selected.; All in 
all, 18 different films and 18 different Hollywood players (some of them 
interweaving in and out of the same films) are edited effectively into the 
story.; A knowledge of some of the more popular noir classics like The Big
Sleep, Double Indemnity, and Suspicion, might help in soaking up the
films' nostalgia.; It's the visual equivalent of David Thomson's one-of-a-kind novel 
'Suspects' - fortunately all the stars and their films are listed in the 
final credits so you don't have to drive yourself crazy trying to figure 
them out afterwards.","Any scene could have Martin conversing with someone like a Cary
Grant or a Veronica Ladd, or being shot at by Alan Ladd.; Burt Lancaster getting plugged in THE KILLERS, James Cagney performing a 
casual execution in WHITE HEAT) don't work nearly as well - in fact it's 
annoying to see the Cagney scene, which was effectively chilling in the 
original, lifted out of context.; This is basically a one-idea film, and that idea, although cleverly
worked out as far as special effects, begins to run dry after a while,
as the story lags in character development.; If
you've seen ""The Bribe,"" you've got the rest of the film's story, as the
Reiner team ran out of ideas and winged the ending the lazy way, with
old film clips.; The first-person narration, black and white photography, art deco 
titles, and opening score by Miklos Rosza establish within moments that this 
is going to be spoof on Raymond Chandler crime thrillers, but if you were to 
enter this film without knowing its central joke, then you'd no doubt be 
surprised to suddenly see Alan Ladd walking down a corridor while Martin 
rummages through an office."
9445.0,Apt Pupil,2000.0,"Overall, the movie is entertaining, thought provoking, and well worth
seeing.; The Dussander regression is rather good
for a bit, mostly because the performance comes from none other than
Brit actor Ian McKellen, a brilliant thespian who's performance in
1995's ""Richard III"" ranks among one of the best of the decade (and one
of the best villains of all time).; This is director Bryan Singer's first film since the complex and
entertaining The Usual Suspects.; This is a superb
and unsettling psychological thriller, that again shows how good a
writer King is when he moves away from straight horror to explore the
darker potential of human nature.; Sir Ian McKellen brings Dussander to life with eerie
skill, and Brad Renfro is also great as a teenager whose world is turned
topsy-turvy.","Last weekend though, a new
   atrocity was unleashed upon the world - the mediocre, eminently
   forgettable ""Apt Pupil.""; The film is littered with noxious episodes which are allegedly supposed to
portray both character's disintegrations, but which don't add up to much more
than ugly attempts to shock the audience -- probably because they're dealt
with in such an exploitive fashion.; Just because a film has a neat philosophy doesn't mean that
that cancels out all the problems with it, such as this film's main
problem, a weak script.; HOWEVER, the
movie does have a few redeeming qualities.; His
character is not stupid, but morally bankrupt, and the movie tries to get its
mileage out of the idea that his moral vacuum may somehow be worse than
Dussander's."
9458.0,Desperate Measures,1996.0,"Cross brings 
a refreshing level of pragmatism to Matt.; The strange thing
this, the very last scene - where McCabe chats to a hospital guard -
caps off on an almost perfect, wonderfully twisted note.; Though there definitely are flaws in the movie, it is entertaining.; Michael Keaton's performance is alone
worth the price of admission, and he has successfully added himself to
my favorite ""deranged criminals"" list.; Now that it's
out, I see no real reason for that delay, as it's a simple yet highly
entertaining film.","That's right, boring trifling cliched cardboard shit.; Too 
bad the execution's all wrong, though, because the set-up of ""Desperate 
Measures"" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to 
far better use.; Not even close, I'm sorry to
say.; ), as Garcia's character seems to break every law in the book
by the end of the film (Why couldn't you just shoot the guy in the legs
to slow him down?; TriStar / 1:40 / 1998 / R (language, violence, wasted talent)
Cast: Michael Keaton; Andy Garcia; Brian Cox; Marcia Gay Harden; Joseph 
Cross; Erik King; Efrain Figueroa 
Director: Barbet Schroeder 
Screenplay: David Klass ""Desperate Measures"" is a generic title for a film that's beyond 
generic."
9463.0,Vampire Hunter D,1968.0,"You see,
like all heroes in these kinds of stories, he¹s a brooder, who¹s sole
purpose in life is to remain really, really silent.; The talking hand was
clever - and I think the inspiration for a skateboard-related logo.; Vampire Hunter D is a gory, gory film.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.; Really, and this is the truth, no
other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said
in the media about it.","Heroes like this are bad when they¹re live, even worse when
animated.; Is there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old
in the shower?; It
was disgusting and gruesome, which overshadowed the story, what little of it
there was.; Later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire, who
wants to marry the peasant girl because he¹s bored after 10,000 years of
living (the only clever vampire insight made in the movie), Will Vampire
Hunter D rush to save her in time?; If it's good
enough for doctors to draw blood from, then why do vampires stray from that
sight?)"
9465.0,Cookie's Fortune,1999.0,"But I, for one, loved this
entertaining gem.; It is a
sunny, delightful, dreamy comedy, filled with lovely performances, skillful
direction and topped off with an understated, clever, extraordinary script.; Kudos to Charles Dutton, who takes his role as Cookie's closest
friend to excellent heights.; Feedback Appreciated!; When people
fish together, the long quiet times together build a bond of trust.","Poor Willis!; Unlike 
Altman's ""Nashville"" or ""The Player,"" ""Cookie's Fortune"" has nothing at 
all to say about anything, hoping that utter wackiness will be enough to 
salvage the proceedings.; With his latest work, ""Cookie's Fortune,"" the director
appears to be pulling inward, affording us an entertaining but
only mildly amusing comedy of the sort that playwright Beth
Henley made famous with her greater flamboyance.; It's a shame, too, because the performances are the central saving grace 
(which isn't nearly enough to save any graces at all concerning this 
movie).; Willis appears to be breaking 
into a house through a kitchen window."
9466.0,Celebrity,1946.0,"The cast makes this 
film a wonderful comic experience and well worth the while.; Though the theme in his films is always different, there
are certain ""trademarks"" that brand all his work: a clever story that
is mostly driven by a neurotic character with deep emotional problems
and of course a cast that is more spectacular than most.; Woody Allen is still very 
strong, and makes his statement with great effect.; It is very well written, with many multidimensional
characters that inhabit its world.; ""Mighty Aphrodite"" is more full of great moments and lines than a really
great story.","Digression aside, ""Celebrity"" was awful.; Well, it's not as bad as
""Shadows and Fog"", so it doesn't qualify as the Worst Woody Allen Movie
Of All Time, but it's up there.; The other problem is that the
image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view
the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic, interesting
characters; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring
dialogue.; He's just not funny, all he's got down pat
are Woody's voice inflections and neurotic gestures.; Opinion:
CELEBRITY could have been interesting as a vivacious comedy, but
director Woody Allen plays this one serious and instead gives us a black
and white film about a shallow divorcee who doesn't seem to go anywhere
as he fails one relationship after another."
9469.0,He Got Game,1991.0,"The songs work
nicely with the film, especially the song that features the Buffalo
Springfield riff, and all of them work in great contrast with the Copland
score.; In fact, I loved it.; Aaron Copland's musical score is fantastic, but it
doesn't always fit the mood of the film:  when Jake and Jesus have a
climactic one-on-one game, Copland's heavy strings and
classical-sounding themes made me too aware of the music, and the best
scores blend in and add to the overall image without being distracting.; Regardless of that, it works as social commentary, entertainment and is
a film that makes its high moments believable and at times tragic.; The film's cast all turn in top-notch performances.","Lacking in any payoff, and
showcasing an awful performance by Jovovich, this subplot just about begs
to be completely cut out.; Way too many slow-pans over meaningless pastoral settings.; However, my
   consternation was with the superfluousness of this entire generic
   subplot, which is so potentless that it calls upon such familiar
   clichis as the good-hearted prostitute under the thumb of an abusive
   pimp.; This
is neither good nor bad, although it might be an indication of a type
of inferiority complex Lee has alluded to regarding the facility white
director's have in marshalling finacing.; Jake's unlikely
friendship with Dakota (Milla Jovovich), a prostitute who lives in the
apartment next door, is completely superfluous, not to mention
unconvincing; Lee offers no insight as to how or why Jake would develop any
feelings, deep or otherwise, for her."
9489.0,You've Got Mail,1997.0,"Nevertheless, I quite enjoyed it.; Some of the best scenes occur when Joe and Kathleen hate each
other  their first encounter at a caviar party is perfectly timed.; In fact, I'm surprised with how much I
liked this movie  it's a perfect family Christmas release, because it
does its job with class and style.; I love ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" and the romantic 
comedy, ""The Philadelphia Story,"" and ""Local Hero,"" a whimsical tale 
packed with quirky characters, is one of my all-time favorite films.; It's all cute and wonderful, and for all of the idealism, 
it makes me feel good.","This movie is not funny, barely romantic (the last 15 minutes are okay,
but only if you want to sit through the first 105 minutes of people
typing, a lot of scripted narration and a grand sub-plot about the
corporate giant stores getting rid of the mom & pops nowadays) and not
at all inspirational or creative.; Maybe by doing this, I am cheating myself out of
an encounter that would have been infinitely fulfilling.; Ordinarily that would be fine, but Tom Hank's
character is boring, ditto for Meg Ryan's.; The other problem 
is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated.; There is just nothing interesting
about watching somebody read text off a screen, just so they can say it
out loud to save the audience from reading it themselves."
9504.0,Glengarry Glen Ross,2000.0,"Well worth full
ticket price to the right film-goer.; This is brilliant: to see the mark and
practice ABC: Always Be Closing.; First as the dazzled mark and then as the apologetic,
wife-driven backslider, Jonathan Pryce displays an amazing range of
emotions on his rubbery face that suffuse it in the rapid, smooth,
transparent successions of color-switching octopus.; He thinks he can still control the
situation, can still come up with the angle that will make everything
come his way--it's goombah desperation, and Lemmon makes it work.; 8)  That's what makes the Glengarry leads so damn important.","In speaking of the actors, one hardly knows where to begin.; That's why nobody likes the leads they've
been given--they're lousy capital.; The director is afraid to keep his camera
still, and many times gets caught off guard by the charging actor.; Either you can make it in the capitalist market or you're dead weight.; To make a close up, for emotionality's sakes, is
un-necessary, and a bit of film idiom, that is wasted here."
9523.0,Lantana,2001.0,"Barbara Hershey is also terrific as a shrink who is oh-so-confident
while gently questioning a client but who demonstrates Freud's
theory of counter-transference in his dislike for a gay patient,
Patrick (Peter Phelps), whose dilly-dallying with a married man
forces her to confront her own paranoia about her marriage to
John.; Lantana's strengths and weaknesses, like its characters, balance each
other out.; Though
the story takes place in a suburb of Sydney, Australia, many of the
people react in similar ways to Americans who undergo that
psychological phenomenon.; Ray Lawrence wonderfully mines territory
similar to what he dug into with the underappreciated ""Bliss""--
capturing the same, almost clinical dimensions of a therapist
(played by Terence Stamp) who in treating a man with emotional
problems unlocks the door to his wife's forgotten past.; One of the more interesting aspects of this complex, yet easy-to-
follow plot, is that Nik and Paula, the most financially challenged
and perhaps least educated couple in the story, are the happiest
people around.","That's the pretentious premise of this
never-ending, two-hour look at couple dysfunction.; Rated R.  Running time: 121 minutes.; Unfortunately, having been adapted for the screen from a play, by the
playwright himself, much of the emotional impact is lost in
overwhelmingly dramatic dialogue.; It doesn't help that,
when these men are trying to talk to one another, there is repetitive
whining about how men aren't suppose to cry or show emotion.; The annoying chatter present when it's two
movie-character men talking is thankfully left out."
9529.0,Candyman,1992.0,"Thank you, and enjoy the show.]; Tony Todd
(NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, 1990 version) is great as the antagonist of
the film.; The sets are well done and
add a spooky atmosphere to the film.; CANDYMAN is one of the best horror films to be released to the theaters
this year (but I expect that DRACULA will beat it).; The actors (and actresses) all do a great job.","But how on earth does any of this fit with the original story's
driving idea?; Wasn't the idea supposed to be
that Candyman was a horrible monster, perhaps real, perhaps legend, who
killed the poor folks in the ghetto whenever the spirit moved him?; Actually,
let's rephrase that: the word ""thesis"" has never appeared in the
screenplay for a *good* horror film, as it remains to be seen whether or
not CANDYMAN will be successful in this unpleasant season of sub-par
horror.; Why
would a community live with this horror?; But given that all Candyman will do is kill you, why on
earth would anyone do this?"
9532.0,Final Destination,1997.0,"Devon Sawa clocks in one great performance as the psychic Alex who can sense
what is going to happen in the future, his character is so well-thought and
Devon brings him out brilliantly, and gives us a character we can both relate
to, and hope we never have to.; He truly bit into this character and delivers an
effective portrayal of a kid who finds himself fighting the battle of his
life...against death!; Final Destination may not be a classic of the genre, but it
delivers enough thrills and shocks to satisfy its target audience!; Ali Larter (who was previously in ""House on
Haunted Hill"" and ""Varsity Blues"") gives a great down to earth performance, as
a girl who is an outcast, not very well-known, but very special in her own way.; The cast is surprisingly effective and up to par; the best ensemble in this
genre since ""Scream.""","* - One of the worst movies ever made.; * * - Pretty bad, see it only if you have nothing better to do.; Unfortunately, this film also suffers from the worst characteristics 
of this genre.; If things couldn't get any worse, then Tony Todd (of
the original Candyman, apparently thrown in here for kicks) will really excite
you as a mortician named Bludworth who appears in one scene, and is never quite
explained.; Only Clear seems sympathetic to this reluctant soothsayer and even
she bristles a bit when Alex begins insisting the worst is not over for
this handful of survivors."
9535.0,Analyze This,1994.0,"It's also fun
to watch this film, and is one definitely worth heading out to the theatre
to see.; brilliant.; ""Analyze This"" may not be great shakes or worthy of being placed in the annals
of great comedy classics, but it is as satisfying and entertaining as any other
comedy I've seen as of late.; All in all an
entertaining, funny film worth seeing.; However, despite its distance from reality, ""Analyze This"" is great fun.","It just crawls
from one scene to another without any forward momentum.; ""Analyze This"" is slow, unfunny, and badly acted.; -- and a cross between a legitimately funny movie and a dull, lifeless
plodding mess.; It's just a  movie.; The result is terribly
disorienting."
9540.0,Dead Ringers,1999.0,"Aided
by a seamless, perfectly-executed motion control split-screen system -- and by
Cronenberg -- Irons does work worthy of the *two* Academy Awards for which he
should be nominated.; There
are images and feelings which will stay with you for quite a while.; In
other ways it is unlike other Cronenberg.; Steve Upstill observed that this film shows a whole new level of maturity
for Cronenberg.; His direction is deft, sure and polished.","The acting and the
     technical work are good but the storyline is slow, muddled,
     confusing, and self-contradictory.; But the plot of the film is
plodding and ponderous.; Note that
the deformity does not fit into the plot, but seems sort of plastered on
and, unlike in most Cronenberg films, is limited solely to dialogue and some
absurd renderings of medical instruments.; The
latter was, in many circles, maligned or simply ignored just because it was a
""horror"" film.; I did not find them worth watching."
9546.0,Ricochet,2001.0,"I do suggest that you go to see the film in
the theater for, like most films, RICOCHET will lose some of it's impact
on video it is well worth the $6.75 admission price (or whatever it is
where you are).; I
highly recommend this film for anyone who likes action films, but a word
of caution for people with weak stomachs; the violence in the film gets
quite gory at some points.; RICOCHET is a very good action film (but not in the league of
TANGO & CASH, which happens to be my favorite action film).; Rookie cop Washington is there and stops him,
and subsequently becomes famous because of it.; This is rapper Ice-T's second film,
the first being NEW JACK CITY.","After the
very beginning the first half is sort of like a prison drama then it
goes back to an action film.; 95 min, R, Action, 1991
Director: Russell Mulcahy
Cast: Denzel Washington, John Lithgow, Ice-T, Kevin Pollak, Lindsay Wagner Criminal Lithgow is planning to get into big time crime with a
killing at a carnival.; The basic thing that I didn't like about the film is the lack of
time that Ice-T got in the film.; For
instance I think that John Glover (from 52 PICK-UP) would have been a
much better bad guy.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
9587.0,Little Women,1998.0,"The details seem very authentic and believable
and the camerawork never gets in the way of the storytelling.; The crowning touch
is Thomas Newman's beautiful score, which perfectly complements the
beautiful images Armstrong provides.; Comparing these two exceptional performances
strongly illustrates Ryder's impressive range.; It is one of the best films of 1994.; The cinematography inside was equally
stunning with wonderful warm candlelight glow yet bright enough to be
able to see things well.","The acting is all incredibly
shallow, but this is a fault of the script they were given.; As it was, I just
felt like the script was being manipulative.; Unfortunately, this leaves Mathis with very little time to make much of
an impression.; The movie runs way too long at 1:50.; I had no problem with what she was saying, but it was
delivered so preachy that it seemed stilted and unreal."
9588.0,Quigley Down Under,2000.0,"It's astonishing scenery.; It's action, adventure, revenge, justice for the Aborigines, a
crazy woman, a wonderfully despicable heavy.; What I like about the film include the villain, the scenery, the
Aborigines, Tom, and (after we know why she's crazy) the woman.; There is even this banjo piece which made
me think we had slipped through a wormhole and landed in New Orleans.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","I've seen all of Tom's movies (pardon the
familiarity of a fan) and he has certainly made some worse ones than
this.; The movie could have been a lot more Australian and a lot less of a
transplanted American western.; What I don't like is the second-hand big-screen Western movie music
which overplays every scene.; Actually, it appears from the
credits that most of the movie was shot in Northern Territory.; QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER has Tom Selleck doing a Western, except in this
case it's Western Australia, supposedly."
9591.0,That Thing You Do!,1994.0,"an enjoyable evening at the
movies.; At the L.A. hotel, African-Amercian doorman
Lamarr is a humorous, sharp and debonair fellow whose short appearances are
perfect.; **** Amazing, potent stuff.; I'm glad he got the chance, 
because although That Thing You Do isn't exactly high cinema, it's certainly 
better than most things that Hollywood spits out, and it's nice to see nice 
guys finishing where they belong.; is a good-natured, simple-minded movie that has a
few magic moments.","is a disappointment.; It's too
boring.; I really wanted to like it, but I couldn't.; 6) Un-cliched editing.; The
script is so reminiscent of so many other films, one wonders if
screenwriter Hanks might have used some kind of fill-in-the-blanks
screenplay template... sort of a Hollywood ""Mad Libs""."
9593.0,Last Action Hero,1994.0,"CRITIQUE:
Fun, enjoyable, action-packed, humorous ride through the world of
movies, action heroes and the fine line that rests between fantasy and
reality.; Fun stuff !; Those who expect a satire of action flicks will be only partially
satisfied.; If you leave your expectations behind, you'll find LAST ACTION
HERO to be an enjoyable film worth recommending to others.; The satire
is quite funny at times.","The editing is choppy,
the effects are surprisingly fake, the stuntwork isn't particularly
spectacular, the music is horrendous, and the writing is mind-numbingly
poor (""If God were a villain, he'd be me"" smirks Benedict to the
camera).; But I found it to be a mess.; CAPSULE: What must have sounded like a surefire idea on paper somehow falls
flat onscreen.; It's hard to believe that a solid action director like John
McTiernan (who made the exceptional DIE HARD and THE HUNT FOR RED
OCTOBER) could be responsible for this turkey.; There's not even a guarantee that kids will
enjoy it--the two ten-year-olds down front were bored out of their
skulls."
9595.0,Hot Shots!,1999.0,"This is unlike
Abrahams' more recent comedies like WELCOME HOME ROXY CARMICHAEL and BIG
BUSINESS.; You can do the
math yourself and figure that HOT SHOTS is a *very funny* movie.; Even where model work is used it is surprisingly good, no doubt by reaping
effects technology as well as cliches from supposedly more serious flying
films.; I recommend running out to the theater to see it, while
it is still there, if you liked THE NAKED GUN 2-1/2 as it is much in the
same style.; Half of the comedy in the film
is based on Charlie Sheen and Cary Elwes both fighting over Valeria
Golino.","I did have one major problem with this movie in that parodying TOP
GUN is hard because a movie that had such an agonizingly predictable
script as TOP GUN was lethally close to being a parody of itself, and
simply because a movie uses lame pathetic obnoxious dialogue as a source
of humor makes said dialogue no less lame pathetic and obnoxious.; Particularly weak is Lloyd Bridges, who is embarrassingly bad as a
senile old admiral, positioned throughout the film as a constant source
of stupid toilet jokes.; As far as I am concerned, NAKED GUN 2-1/2 just did not click.; And at that point I said that a
film was just not as funny if it did not have all three funny men doing the
writing.; Even telling the names of most of the other characters would be giving away
some of the gags of the film, not that HOT SHOTS could not spare them."
9598.0,Babe,1999.0,"Jeffrey (age 6) got a little
scared in a few parts as he frequently does, but loved the show overall
and gave it a double thumbs up.; It is an
extremely well crafted show, especially for its genre.; This is a good family film.; The story is compelling.; And certainly there was a great deal more to enjoy than
what the clips showed.","Even hearing positive reviews did not convince me.; I need
to point out that the plot of this movie has a striking resemblance to
the recent major critical bomb called GORDY, but this is not that
movie.; The film starts off like your typical children's story, it seems like it may
be a sappy and boring movie for adults, but surprisingly enough it isn't.; *** (out of 4 = good)
1995, PG, 92 minutes [1 hour, 32 minutes]
[comedy]
Starring: Christine Cavanaugh (voice of Babe), James Cromwell (Farmer
Hoggett) Magda Szubanski (Mrs. Hoggett), produced by George Miller, Doug
Mitchell, Bill Miller, written by George Miller, Chris Noonan, directed by
Chris Noonan, based on the novel by Dick King-Smith.; No big name actors voice the animals, though
Roscoe Lee Brown narrates."
9600.0,Big Momma's House,1987.0,"Some of the best action films, funniest
comedies and even a few exceptional dramas are released while the sun
shines.; Nia Long, who showed well in The Best Man, is a lovely actress who will 
certainly live this down.; Since Momma has left town, Malcolm sees an excellent opportunity.; Individual episodes such as these are what viewers will remember most
about _Big_Momma's_House_, and that may very well be enough for the film
to become a hit.; The funniest scene with Anderson involves his 
teaching a karate class to a group of old ladies and being taught a 
thing or two himself by Malcolm, as Big Momma.","That's what moviegoers will buy their
tickets to see, and apparently that's the only reason why the director
and writers made this project, for the thin sliver of a plot is just an
excuse to get Lawrence in costume and let him do his thing.; He just 
needs better material to work with.; The plot can basically be summed up as ""Martin Lawrence
dresses up as a fat woman""... and even that description is too wordy.; Instead, we get Lawrence looking very bored under a ton of makeup, using 
a scratchy, high-pitched voice that somehow sounds worse than 
fingernails on a chalk board.; Its lack of
big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all
relevant."
9603.0,Clueless,2000.0,"Alicia Silverstone gives a flawless performance as a ditzy rich
girl.; The show is fun and good
spirited.; Anyway, I thought the movie was fun, my daughter and I had a good
time and I would recommend it for teens and parents with a sense of
humor.; Definitely
designed to appeal to an elite taste, but it's well written, well performed
and quite charming nonetheless.; Teenagers and those who still identify with them should enjoy
and perhaps even identify with some of the characters.","The worst thing for a comedy to be is
unfunny, which is what CLUELESS is.; Back to the movie, CLUELESS is just awful.; I hate to be blunt, but CLUELESS stinks.; There's simply not much else to be said about CLUELESS.; ""This is terrible,"" you may thinking to yourself."
9604.0,Red Heat,1999.0,"Enjoyable as a
     summer throwaway.; O guess that really captures the Soviet feel.; Ivan
Danko (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), a muscle-bound Moscow policeman, is
dispatched to Chicago to pick up an escaped pusher.; The Soviets are shown as
occasionally having effective, if brutal, means of ridding their society of
criminals.; He is chosen because he
is already on the case and perhaps because his English is better than his
Russian.","Maybe it was the automatic success of even
the very weak BEVERLY HILLS COP and the marginally better LETHAL WEAPON.; Of course,
without this scene the film would have almost no female nudity and
authenticity does not sell tickets.; That one is like a COOGAN'S BLUFF and a ROBOCOP
where someone of questionable value proves his worth.; But, hey, Hill's audiences have nothing against brutal or they
would not still be Hill's audiences.; Then there is the obviously authentic
Austrian accent his Moscow policeman has."
9606.0,Metropolis,1999.0,"Currently, the following versions are available:
The Kino Video version, available from Kino[1] and a number of other
suppliers; Giorgio Moroder's version, out of print but still fairly
easy to come by from used video dealers[2]; and a new DVD release 
by Classic Media Holdings, available from the XOOM Website[3].; We've gotten a
wonderfully crafted satire, all wrapped around with awesome visuals and
great effects.; ""Metropolis"" definitely has 
Expressionist elements, although Lang kept the sets and the characters 
more realistic than in highly stylized Expressionist films like ""The 
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"".; ""Metropolis"" is one of the few films
that is deemed a classic, and is also brilliant besides that.; The Kino score kept me distant from the visuals, 
while Moroder's score drew me in.","The bottom line is, that lacking that authoritive version, 
Moroder's reconstruction is as valid (or, as invalid) as 
anyone else's, and that someone outside the Ivory Tower of 
Academia would be audacious enough to attempt this is really 
guilty of nothing worse than causing a bad case of sour grapes.; The result is the video equivalent
of releasing old, worn, scratched 78RPM phonograph discs on
CDs without bothering to clean up the sound.; I don't know about you, but
this just causes me to cringe up, and even though I could just turn the
volume down, it would still be tinted and all messed up.; Since the original film was intended to be shown at somewhere 
between 18fps and 20fps, the action in the film is 20% to 30% too 
fast.; Some of the stilted acting style in ""Metropolis"" 
is simply a realization of the Expressionist codes."
9611.0,Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,1997.0,"It's a quiet, gentle humour but quite enjoyable all the same.; Very funny.; ROMY AND MICHELE is a film with plenty of enjoyable bits and
pieces, but it may actually hit its '80s nostalgia target a bit too well.; But both are fun and exuberant, and Garofalo is as entertaining 
here as ever.; So, summing up; the film is unashamedly unoriginal and maybe not quite as
funny as it could have been it's an enjoyable, feel-good yarn.","And unfortunately, four bulging
breasts do not a good movie make.; It's just a wonder that Kudrow
agreed to star in a film that basically stereotypes her as the scatty
blonde.; Basically, the film just boils down to two empty-headed, unfunny women who
wear tight, revealing clothing who are doing and saying things which
couldn't interest me in the slightest.; The only reason for her character to be here
is so that she can point out to Romy and Michele that no matter how bad they
thought they had it in high school, others had it worse.; 45 seconds out of 91 minutes is not a good
ratio."
9614.0,Happy Gilmore,2000.0,"Along for the ride is a beautiful publicist (Julie Bowen), who 
becomes (surprise, surprise!); Eggbert: How delightful.; As the honourable Naturalist, Mark Rylance was
superb.; I laughed so hard, it brought tears
ta my eyes.; Director Dennis Dugan (PROBLEM CHILD) does a great job of sustaining
momentum.","Why is any of this supposed to be funny?; Here, it's a lame clothesline
to hang a bunch of extremely uncomfortable scenes masquerading as comedy.; Alas, this picture just isn't on par with the 
passable 1980 farce.; Never have I seen a movie that was so blatant in these plugs as this
one was.; My predicament is, I can't recommend Angels And Insects in good
conscious because the filmmakers endorse an unjustifiable contempt for the
Victorian English aristocracy."
9622.0,Beverly Hills Ninja,1993.0,"He is ""The Great White Hope"",
the fulfilment of an ancient prophecy - a white child will be found
adrift the shores of Japan, and he will become the greatest ninja of his
generation.; It's funny!).; Sabotage and stealth are his tools, and chaos is both a friend and foe.; Chris Farley has appeared in supporting roles in 'Coneheads' and
'Wayne's World 2' (both 1993) and has since had leading roles
co-starring with fellow SNL comedian David Spade in 'Tommy Boy' (1995)
and 'Black Sheep' (1996).; Chan's 
latest effort to hit U.S. shores, FIRST STRIKE, may not be the best 
movie released this month, but it's a significant improvement over this 
lame comedy.","Unfortunately, the end result of this single dimensional joke is
watching Humpty Dumpty fall down, over and over again.; 'Beverly Hills Ninja' will be remembered as
one of the worst films of 1997 and perhaps of all time as Farley
projects a fake wisdom of the ninja culture in his dialogue while
coming off as phony and unfunny.; What do you get when you cross repetitive slapstick and wooden
direction?; Farley's antics, by themselves, are just not funny.; He just doesn't have it as a
slapstick comic and the entire movie runs like a single handedly played
out Three Stooges skit."
9624.0,On Deadly Ground,1994.0,"There's plenty of violence, lots of fights
and explosions, and the miniatures special effects work is impressive.; Once it is revealed that (surprise, surprise) Forrest is a CIA-
trained demolition expert, and Jennings sends a pack of professional
killers out to eliminate him, the action picks up.; But this one
has a special place in my heart.; Early
in the film, Forrest is employed by Aegis Oil chief Michael Jennings
(Michael Caine) to deal with an explosion at one of Aegis' rigs, where
it becomes evident that everything isn't up to specs on the well's
safety equipment.; There are many mysteries in life.","Unfortunately, with
Seagal as director there was nobody else to compensate his
obvious lack of talents.; Seagal's lack of
directorial skills only underlines weakness of the script
with one-dimensional characters and total lack of subtlety.; Self-indulgent and deadly dull for at least half of its running time,
ON DEADLY GROUND demonstrates why an ego like Seagal's needs something
to keep it in check.; Hardly the right reward for having to sit
through Eskimo subtitles, R.  Lee Emery's crewcut, and Steven Seagal
trying to be Kevin Costner.; The Big Shoot Out is the Big Disappointment."
9638.0,Phantasm,2000.0,"It's one of the best bad films I've ever
seen.; Given its underground success, 'Phantasm' was released a couple of
years ago on laser disc with a new stereo surround soundtrack and in
widescreen format.; A retrospective movie review by Walter Frith For those of you who have seen 'Phantasm' and perhaps its two sequels,
you have to ask yourself a question.; Even super critics Siskel and Ebert for whom I have a
lot of respect, have admitted to liking certain films that most people despised.; The answer is
definitely ""yes"".","Is it a bad film?; The film looks more like a test product than a full length
feature film.; But guess what?; It takes place in California where two brothers become involved in a
menacing plot concocted by a funeral home director to abduct the dead from
his nearby cemetery and use them in a slave plot in another dimension apart
from our world.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
9679.0,Gone in Sixty Seconds,1979.0,"But on a baser, more primal level, I enjoyed 
it.; he takes the best stuff from things we've 
seen before, and makes it into a fun, exciting, and pleasing film.; Despite its many flaws, Seconds is still worth the
price of admission just for the unique and diverse casting, which
includes big-name stars, regulars in independent cinema, a British
soccer star and  get this  three Oscar winners (Cage, Jolie and
Duvall).; That brings him back
into the grim world of crime and fear for one last, intense
high-stakes heist.; One is the best car chases this side of 
""Ronin""; the other is a terrific soundtrack which features classic songs 
like ""The Lowrider"" combined with yet another great score from composer 
Trevor Rabin (""Armageddon"").","""Bad.""); It's a shame to waste it in glitzy, superficial tripe like ""Gone in 60 
Seconds.""; Is all this dull?; The weak script is a waste of a 
talented cast.; This was
not only a bad film but a particularly annoying one."
9684.0,Sweet and Lowdown,2001.0,"`Sweet And Lowdown', Allen's
32nd feature film, is highly enjoyable, funny and unpredictable.; This amusing relationship makes up the core of the film, and it works
very well thanks in part to Sean Penn's over-the-top antics.; Samantha Morton has also received plenty of praise for her role as a
mute laundress with whom Emmet has a lengthy relationship, and it's 
certainly an impressive physical performance.; The acting by all is excellent, with top, Oscar-worthy honors going 
to  Sean Penn and Samantha Morton.; It also brings to the greater public's attention a real legend in guitar
music, Django Reinhardt, the gypsy jazz guitarist from the Paris of the
1930s-1950s; he played a great guitar despite having lost his fingers in
a childhood accident.","Sounds exciting, but unfortunately the actual story is so boring
and uneventful that it's hard to care about any of this.; What's worse is that the structure just plain doesn't work.; By
general standards, it is merely slow and dull.; By Woody Allen standards, this is a bad film.; Try Juno for FREE -- then it's just $9.95/month if you act NOW!"
9686.0,New York Stories,1995.0,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""Life Without Zoe"" is essentially a children's
film, a genre Coppola does surprisingly well in.; ""Life Lessons"" by Martin Scorsese has Nick Nolte as a popular artist
who is behind schedule painting for a show of his works coming up in three
weeks.; There is a lot of shouting, a lot of
loud 1960s music, and one nice piece of music from Puccini's TURNADOT.; His Zoetrope company made
the very good THE BLACK STALLION.; I rate it a +1.","Some
supernatural force grants his wish only to make things a lot worse for him.; I
would rate this segment a low +1 on the -4 to +4 scale.; Now Disney's
Touchstone has given three popular directors a chance to work with a
shorter-than-feature-length piece.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
9691.0,Assassins,1994.0,"Stallone is an excellent ageing assassin.; A modern 
morality tale, which we've seen in a thousand different ways before, but 
its well done, and deserves much more credit than it has.; I don't know what you look for in a movie, but if it's a well-told story 
of redemption, an action flick with plenty of shooting to keep everybody 
happy, a bit of romance, and a happy ending - well, it almost as good on 
video as on the big screen.; That
it is, and it's a pretty good one to boot.; Those Stallone die-hards should be pleased with their idol's latest, 
ASSASSINS.","But there are time when the
action tries a bit too hard, only to end up being totally boring and
predictable.; It's like Arnold 
Schwarzenegger essaying an existentialist--laughably absurd.; Come to think of 
it, though, even an accomplished actor couldn't do much with this 
screenplay.; The action scenes are competently constructed, and the 
climactic shootout provides a few moments of tension, but that's 
scarcely reason to sit through the rest of ASSASSINS' drivel.; After all, if you listen to people, it's supposed to be just 
some ponderous would-be action flick with stereotypical cardboard 
characters and unconvincing perfomances overall."
9698.0,Straight to Hell,1999.0,"Well, great plan, and the sense of humor that Cox used in REPO MAN is much
in evidence.; Alex Cox's spoof captures much of what makes a great spaghetti western.; The Pogues,
in particular, produced a wonderful opening theme that combines with some
interesting optical effects to make the best opening credits I've seen this
year (""Cruelty and Abuse Consultant"").; D (with affection), but let
me know if you find a soundtrack!!; The rest of the film takes place in the village, and here is where the
film breaks down; ANYTHING can happen, it appears, and thus insanity builds on
insanity.","It proves that watching even the strangest
antics can be boring if after twenty minutes nothing else happens.; But mostly Cox unintentionally shows that the
spaghetti westerns were a pointless indulgence in a genre that the director
didn't really understand.; What's missing is any semblance of a plot, if only to
self-lampoon as it progresses.; The result is a rambling mish-mash that is
entertaining as often as it is boring, and ultimately ends without ever having
gone anywhere.; The plot of STRAIGHT TO HELL
reminds one more of CASINO ROYALE or THE CANNONBALL RUN; it seems to be an
excuse for guest stars to make minute cameos."
9713.0,Holy Man,1997.0,"But
   behind this simple packaging lies a subtle film that's not perfect,
   but still a better entertainment value than most.; And that
feature is.... Jeff delivers an incredible performance in this movie, heartfelt and very
human.; His soothing voice and simple logic makes people
feel good, and it's this quality that will make G the new GBN television
star and the key to the network's success.; I liked Holy Man in many ways.; Before he flees from the world
of things, he provides us with a portrait of a man who
connects with us because of his uncomplicated, homespun
warmth, beaming smile, and selfless devotion to people he
has grown to love.","It _is_ a
mish-mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog.; @#% that movie was awful!""; Schulman's last script, 8 HEADS IN A DUFFEL BAG,
was awful enough to earn the picture prominent positions on many of last
year's lists of the worst films.; An
attempt to satirize stupid television, we get a self-parody instead.; Murphy lends nothing to his character
and poor Goldblum looks as if he'd rather be someplace else."
9715.0,Hope Floats,1998.0,"Hope Floats might not be the
perfect movie, but it is a beautiful movie and a good date film.; She is
strong, tender, vulnerable, and funny.; Hope Floats, at a little under two hours, moves gracefully, thanks to
Whitaker's wonderful eye for composition and detail.; In one of movie's many funny scenes, Birdee relates how Justin
shocked her with a kiss when she was a girl.; Sure, it's no ""Terms of Endearment,"" but it's light years better than 
fare like ""A Thousand Acres.""","But that's not the film's 
worst failing, because, beyond all the attempts to sell Kleenexes, HOPE 
FLOATS is boring.; The result is: that there is nothing special about
this film to recommend it, nor is there anything particularly horrid
about it to urge you to avoid it.; Is it just me or is this
guy horribly disfigured?; At its worst, it is so afraid to insult
anyone that it ended up insulting me for sitting through it.; The film is so formulatic that the plot becomes little more than
a paint-by-numbers exercise."
9746.0,Kundun,1990.0,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements of the year, 'Kundun' is
a rare cinematic experience, that intoxicates you with its majestic
poetry, beauty and spiritual symbolism.; He was wonderfully eloquent, sharp, witty,
more impressive than even star scholars.; But the film still presents him wonderfully, shown as a man who is perfect,
but gained that throughout the years, not being born that way.; It provides a
deep spirituality, but denies the Dalai Lama humanity; he is permitted
certain little human touches, but is essentially an icon, not a
man.; A cult favorite who's done certain films as the beautiful
""Koyannisquati,"" the man may finally get the Oscar he really deserves.","Martin Scorsese is too talented a director to put together anything
that is a complete waste of time.; The director exhibits far too much reverence for the subject of this 
biography.; The first half is as dull as
dishwater.; While that film was entertaining
but not very insightful, Kundun lacks substantial entertainment value,
and is only marginally more interesting as a biography of the Dalai
Lama.; As bad as it was, at least it had a narrative and
some characters."
9748.0,D.O.A.,1999.0,"Quaid, to me, is a much more believable
""everyman"" than Ford (in this role, at least; I generally like Ford's
performances), and displays a greater acting range (ever notice how Ford seemed
to only have one expression--pained--during FRANTIC?).; It has more sophisticated commentary and humor.; Good pacing.; The story revolves around Dexter Cornell, portrayed by Dennis Quaid.; It has a good story.","To make it worse, his wife is murdered, 
and he's the prime suspect.; The rest of the movie is dedicated to him trying 
to figure out who's trying to ruin his day.; Early in the film, he manages to swallow 
a rare, fatal, slow-acting (24-48 hours to live) poison (""phosphorous 
chloride"") during a drinking binge.; For those of you who sort of liked FRANTIC's idea (style, ""normal guy in
jeopardy"" plot), but didn't feel compelled to write in a story during the
boring execution of the film, the new movie, D.O.A., should be most welcome.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
9768.0,Cry-Baby,1997.0,"But
fortunately, Waters has assembled a stellar cast.; Patty Hearst, of all people, has a lot of fun playing Lords'
chipper, bright-eyed mother.; Willem Dafoe pops up unexpectedly as a
Juvenile Hall security guard.; Johnny Depp plays the John Travolta character, a bad boy rock 'n
roll greaser.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","The recycled
plot pits snobby squares against ultra-hip juvenile delinquents, an idea
which went sour eight years ago with the release of GREASE 2.; CRY-BABY is essentially a noisy and
pointless GREASE rip-off.; The plot is so light-weight
you kind of hope the director will do something tasteless just to spice
things up.; But, sadly, the
tongue-in-cheek comedy is bereft of originality.; One off-beat actor after
another parades across the screen."
9769.0,Lolita,1999.0,"It works well, and adds to the poetry of this film.; Irons, with his long face, is perfect as the obsessed
leacher.; I wouldn't hesitate to say
that he is one of the best actors working today.; Irons fulfills that criteria beautifully, and gives a performance that's
virtually faultless.; So: this is a good movie, pulls you into the unfolding
story and puts you in Humbert's obsessions, is able to evoke a certain
sympathy for his situation as well as horror.","I did not really want to like this film.; About two
hours and fifteen minutes of suffering, from a movie that seems to try to be
as pretentious and kitsch as it can.; But dull it is not.; The movie is bad, and all this expectations, created around it, this senseless
polemic, only make things worse for a viewer seeing the movie after hearing
too much about it.; This means that body-doubles can't be
used, not even by digitally superimposing the head of a child in the body of a
full grown and responsible woman, paid only to expose her body (which is,
undoubtedly, a very amusing idea)."
9772.0,Air Force One,1992.0,"This 
is the busiest, most powerful man in the world and he's seen this film 
_twice_.; This scene is very enjoyable and it will make a lot of people
think.; Petersen gets so many of the small details perfect.; It is the best action film I have seen this year, 
not the best film overall, but easily the best of its genre.; In short, Ford delivers one of his best performances ever.","The idea is to essentially give the audience a
relentless assault on the senses and nothing more; some succeed such as
""Mission: Impossible,"" and others fail like the mediocre ""Broken Arrow"" and the
absurd ""Ransom.""; Liesel Matthews was similarly a horrible First Brat.; Ford may be a good actor, but not even he 
can make us swallow a fantasy character like this.; Another problematic element is the first daughter  there's simply no reason for
her to be held captive other than to have a child in peril and to mimic the
structure of the real First Family.; Oldman's ultra-nationalistic
terrorist philosophy falls flat."
9777.0,Proof,1998.0,"Russell Crowe was excellent as the young adult who is befriended by
Weaving.; Weaving finds Russell Crowe, who he trusts, to describe his
photos to him.; Genevieve Picot was very good as the housekeeper.; I feel it is worth seeing.; The story moves along rather well.","There were some places
in the film when the actors came out with some moronic lines, but not
many.; I don't think that there were any actors in the film that I
felt were miscast.; On a scale of zero to
five, I give PROOF a four.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; However, if it comes to your
area, I suggest trying it."
9781.0,Detroit Rock City,1998.0,"But I'm still
surprised what a solid movie this is.; I loved this movie the whole way through, starting with its wonderful
collage of 70s memorabilia credits, the plentitude of references and
in-jokes to all things from that time period, the dead-on performances from
all of its stars, and of course, its satisfyingly predictable finale.; Despite all of this,
Detroit Rock City is surprisingly fresh and funny.; But I still loved DETROIT ROCK CITY, the new comedy about four stoned
teenagers in 1978 overcoming great opposition to see KISS play live in
Detroit.; It's obviously corny and it
gets a lot of laughs on that level, but it's also something that can
be easily related to.","It's a waste of time and
money.; Too bad, they might have provided some energy to
this mess.; Vulgar mockery of any religion
is not funny.; It's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste, because it'
s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of
this dead turkey of a movie.; There are far worse models for a film of this kind."
9798.0,Enemy of the State,1992.0,"Brilliant.; Smith delivers a strong performance as the innocent citizen on
the run from government agencies and unsure of whom he can trust.; The acting is terrific; Will Smith is a very good performer, and makes
a great everyman in this role.; He
does a great job in this film, and when you throw Gene Hackman and Jon
Voight into the mix, you can almost guarantee that you have a very
entertaining movie.; In the end, Enemy of the State is a 'higher class' of action movie, and
while it could have been shorter, it's an entertaining and sometimes clever
look at the world of espionage, and is worth a look.","(At least they do not kidnap 
the wife or kid:  that would have turned the film into the worst kind of 
""jep"" story.); What a waste.; Enemy was one of the worst films of last year.; _Enemy of the State_ has every reason to be a bad movie.; Why
screenwriter David Marconi wanted to engender sympathy for the villain is
beyond me."
9800.0,Philadelphia,1996.0,"I highly recommend this show to everyone over 12 and
award it *** 1/2.; He really carries this movie, and deserves the
accolades being heaped upon him for this role, independently of the
courage he showed in taking it.; Go see it and enjoy.; (By the way, the music in this film is excellent,
and really enhances the story line.); The performances were top-notch, Hanks was absolutely incredible
in the main role, Washington was excellent, but his character could
have used a bit more investigation.","Her script was so bad on the
other hand, you kind of had to kind of feel sorry for her.; One interesting/annoying aspect of PHILADELPHIA is the film's
omnipotent point-of-view.; The writing is weak here, too; it's as if the writer
wasn't interested in dramatizing what should be one of the two major
points of the film.; Without Denzel, it would
have been impossibly dreary, stacked, banal.; PHILADELPHIA is a good idea, just not a particularly good film."
9807.0,Aladdin,1971.0,"The genie (voice
by Robin Williams) is hilarious, and it is he who really gives this
movie it's life.; ALADDIN is still a treat.; But it stands on it's own,
and should not be discounted.; Well, Disney has certainly gotten the message.; It
is also a little different from those two.","If Hollywood can't
forget, then why is it that G-rated movies are among the top grossing
movies at the box office?; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
9812.0,Thursday,2000.0,"I echo Ebert's sentiments, but from a different angle.; Michael Dequina

Mr. Brown's Movie Site: http://welcome.to/mrbrown
CompuServe Hollywood Hotline: http://www.HollywoodHotline.com The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; In a recent article for the _Chicago_Sun-Times_, Roger Ebert commented,
""It's pretty hard to offend me, but a film named _Thursday_ crossed the
line at the Toronto Film Festival earlier this month.; Woods,
on the other hand, hails from the school of film that believes that shock
value in and of itself equals hipness.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","In actuality, it only equates to
pathetic desperation.; There's absolutely no substance to
Woods's script beyond the setup: a ""reformed"" ex-drug dealer (Thomas Jane)
who has his quiet Houston household violently thrown upside down after his
still-in-the-biz ex-partner (Aaron Eckhart, who should have known better)
arrives for a stay.; There is a lot of
violence, sex, and various other forms of bad behavior on display in first
time writer-director Skip Woods's low-budget thriller.; I saw a movie so reprehensible I couldn't rationalize it using the
standard critical language about style, genre or irony.; Watching it, I felt
outrage."
9823.0,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,1997.0,"Fight scenes are
well-choreographed, highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility.; But `Mortal Kombat' succeeded in 
contradicting the trend to become an unabashedly, unpretentiously 
enjoyable all-out action vehicle.; Beautifully choreographed by Robin
Shou, who also plays Liu Kang, the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and
graceful, acrobatic enough to make Olympic gymnasts weep.; CAPSULE: A step down from the earlier movie: not as enjoyable, not as
well-done, but a pleasant enough timekiller.; And, if you haven't had the opportunity, I would
definitely recommend that you see it on video.","To make 
matters worse, ANNIHILATION's special effects are so bad that they're 
laughable.; Why do none of the writers of this movie
care to tell us any of this?; Unfortunately, they're dull and 
monotonous.; This plot even fails at that.; However, MK2 tries to give these players a certain amount of
depth, an element that was lacking in the first movie, but the attempt
here fails miserably."
9824.0,Mystery Men,2000.0,"Overall, Mystery Men is a very enjoyable experience.; Men is
worth seeing alone, for those 2 troubled heroes.; Well, 
Frankenstein captures Amazing rather easily.; It's a wonderfully
wacky bit.; Based on the Dark Horse
comic, Mystery Men affectionately sends up the conventions of more
familiar super heroes, but it also taps the genre for some rich
satire.","Terrible acting, terrible script, and a terrible waste of time changes opinions
about all of these actors.; The script is probably the worst of 1999.; So-called comedy flies at a rapid rate throughout the film, but the problem 
is none of it is the least bit funny, only groan-inducing and lame.; She ultimately is not very fun to watch 
here, simply because the rest of the movie is so nauseatingly awful, but she 
does have a few good lines and shines just by appearing on the screen.; And the Sphinx spouts awful puns."
9869.0,Patriot Games,1997.0,"Anne Archer largely
reprieves her role as the worried mother from FATAL ATTRACTION, but
still elicits our sympathy and support; if only the Ryans weren't quite
such a perfect family, but still Archer knows what she's about and does
it sensibly and admirably.; Ford is the perfect father and husband,
Archer the perfect wife and mother, and Sally is the perfect
daughter.; The music by James Horner is
notable: he makes extensive use of two pieces of music by other composers.; Ford gets some humorous back up from his CIA colleagues Samuel
Jackson and James Earl Jones (the only RED OCTOBER alumnus to return);
Edward Fox is fine as the endangered royal with the common touch,
probably better than the House of Windsor deserves.; PATRIOT GAMES is directed by Philip Noyce, who also directed an
exceptionally good thriller, DEAD CALM.","It
looks almost laughable.; But I'm sorry, this film just doesn't
succeed.; This character
is boring.; He is dull as dishwater.; He is uninspired."
9871.0,Ginger Snaps,2000.0,"Most of the
movie, however, is quite original and worth recommending to fans of the werewolf
genre.; Actually, Ginger has a lot of
things that her mom has never seen before on a girl, from thick animal hair to a
growing tail.; Ginger is in the bathtub cleaning up, something that
she's been having to do frequently of late.; Rebels who want nothing to do with their classmates or anyone else, they have
personalities both fascinating and repulsive.; After Brigitte, slightly the older of the two sisters, is bitten one night, she
turns into the town slut.","The story moves with precision until the last act, which is bloated and too
traditionally over the top like a standard low-grade slasher film.; According to the television, it seems that there's
some kind of wild animal on the loose.; In its
opening sequence, a toddler starts playing with the bloody remains of his dog.; And she practices very unsafe sex.; We cut to our two protagonists, close sisters Brigitte (Emily Perkins) and
Ginger."
9874.0,Cobra,,"The fact that
Rodrigo returns unattached keeps the fantasy alive -- Rodrigo
is still available.; A silent film can be awe-inspiring (""Thief of Bagdad"",
""Metropolis""); it can be lyrically beautiful (""Sunrise"").; Sent via Deja.com http://www.deja.com/
Share what you know.; My list of 5 all-time favorite films includes two silents.; Count Rodrigo Torriani (Valentino) is young, handsome and broke.","I watched the new Image DVD of ""Cobra"", a disc that suffers
from less than pristine picture quality, and a total lack
of any extra material that might help the viewer put the
film into some sort of historical context.; ""Cobra"" is neither, and its technique with static camera
placment is most un-cinematic.; The fire between them in ""Cobra""
has been damped down to a feeble smolder, and they get only
one unconvincing smooch.; Jack's lifestyle is as dull as Rodrigo's is
exciting.; I finally
concluded that it must have been an attempt to capitalize on
it's star's (Rudolph Valentino) innate magnetism to women --
a romantic fantasy."
9877.0,Urban Legend,1996.0,"""Urban Legend"" is one of the very best of the recent slasher offerings, 
because it mixes its laughs and chills with more smoothness and grace 
than usual, and it proves that just because it's a horror movie where 
people are brutally murdered doesn't mean it still can't be intelligent 
and impressive filmmaking.; It's a very
good setup that promises more chills to come.; ""Urban Legend"" is one of the very best of the 
recent slasher offerings, because it mixes its laughs and chills with 
more smoothness and grace than usual, and it proves that just because 
it's a horror movie that includes people being murdered doesn't mean it 
still can't be intelligent and impressive filmmaking.; Legend isn't fresh in the brains department, but, lo, it is a lot of fun.; First, the DVD transfer and sound is top-notch, like all of Sony's 
releases, and includes clear, precise colors, with an appropriate 
emphasis on shades of blue.","Portraying intelligence is
not enough; she lacks excitement.; Starring:  Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Jared Leto, Joshua
Jackson, Tara Reid, John Neville, Robert Englund, Julian 
Richings, Natasha Wagner The only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that
the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective.; But I wonder if the director, Jamie Blanks,
had any idea that the film is inherently and completely ridiculous.; There's just not enough humor
or creativity to compensate for the raw terror lost in forced attempts to
be cute.; Most of the time, 
however, the filmmakers' scare tactics include silly false jumps and 
absurd red herrings; just about everyone around Pendleton, for example, 
owns and wears our psycho's hooded Nanook of the North-type costume."
9879.0,Striptease,1999.0,"The big, muscular bouncer is very nice--to all 
those who are nice.; Ving Rhames has a great role as the Eager Beaver's put-upon
bouncer Shad, a man looking for the get-rich-quick scheme which will allow
him to get out of the bouncer business; he gets one of STRIPTEASE's best
moments as he impresses a couple of thugs with tales of his
responsibilities ""auditioning"" topless dancers.; Among the colorful characters at the Eager Beaver, the club where she 
dances, is a fan who promises to help get her daughter back.; Based on Carl
Hiaasen's novel, the story demands a darker edge in its political satire,
a sense of irony that the topless dancer is one of the few characters in
the film with any morals.; That's a real shame, because there are plenty of moments in
STRIPTEASE where Bergman's wonderfully weird sense of humor gets to shine
through.","What a waste!; Most of the acting is terrible (Ving
Rhames survives best), the jokes are lame and very lame (I didn't laugh
once).; For Demi Moore it
is her willingness to take large sums of money to play in movies no
matter how terrible the script.; Avoid this picture like the plague.; This one gets my vote as Worst Movie of the Year."
9896.0,Rat Race,1992.0,"White it
isn't as hilarious or as inspired as his previous
work, you'll still find something that will make you
grin.; Cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap;
Lovitz is, at first, a bit whiny, but his character grows on you; Gooding is
having a fine romp; and Dave Thomas almost steals the show as Cleese's deadpan
assistant, a man ""born without a personality.""; ""Rat Race"" is a great goofy delight, a dandy mix of
energetic performances, inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness.; This is a fun little feature.; In another memorable segment, thanks to great comic
timing by Jon Lovitz, you would have never known that
Adolph Hitler could be so funny.","His annoying character, who suffers from narcolepsy,
is a klutz.; With a script written by former Saturday Night
Liver Andy Breckman and direction from Jerry Zucker (Airplane, Police
Squad), no comedic stone is left unturned.; Meanwhile, the ending takes an absurd detour away from
its beloved sense of madcapped buffonery and veers
towards an ill-advised attempt at a schmaltzy,
feel-good ending.; Director Jerry Zucker (""Airplane,"" ""Ghost"") leaps from racer to racer,
periodically returning to Las Vegas where Sinclair and Mr. Grisham (Dave
Thomas), his personality-impaired right hand man, continue cooking up
bizarre bets for the gamblers.; The movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like
they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy, featuring
animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding
around the screen."
9945.0,Vampires,1994.0,"Definitely, it's an entertaining film.; Although not quite as good as the vampire movie HABIT, just released
this week on video, VAMPIRES is a wonderfully entertaining movie that
will pleasantly surprise those who see it.; James Woods has a great time playing a bastard and 
it's entertaining watching him enjoy himself.; ""Vampires"" is a very enjoyable film.; Her change from fear
and loathing to acceptance is remarkably subtle and believable.","_Vampires_
lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot.; Very disappointing.; Even greater a problem is that killing
vampires just doesn't seem enough of an idea to warrant a film, even
though the screenplay was adapted from the novel Vampire$, by John
Steakley.; There is no story development, and there isn't even 
an attempt to flesh out the characters.; The same cannot be said for the turgid, monotonous
shenanigans of ""John Carpenter's Vampires,"" a shallow film where Woods is
reduced to a one-dimensional sideshow attraction."
9946.0,End of Days,,"Subtle, Marlowe,
subtle.; * * * * - Great flick.; I highly recommend seeing it for that purpose.; Comments Appreciated!; Taking the ball is director Peter
Hyams, who knows how to frame a well-choreographed action sequence to
near perfection, and does so in a pair of extravagant scenes that
include all the usual Arnold ingredients: rapid gunfire, colossal
explosions and lots of physical exertion on the part of the star.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; It's a silly, incomprehensible, endlessly stupid mess.; It's just lousy.; This being an action blockbuster, it's no surprise that the
worst thing about it is the script, which starts off totally confusing, and
when some of it is explained (and not much of it is), it's utterly
ridiculous.; The story was so terrible and inaccurate, that it did not have an iota
of value or credibility."
9977.0,Children of the Revolution,1999.0,"As a political satire, the film definitely shows its weakness in
dealing with the reality of the Soviet Union and Stalin.; This is probably the funniest and most genuine part of the
film and gains much chuckles from the audience.; There may be too much packed in the movie, although  a second viewing will
sift through the components and makes the film even more coherent and
enjoyable for those who are aware of history and film history.; Nine months later, when Joan is back in Sydney and married to 
Zachary, she gives birth to a baby boy.; Some of the satire is broader than 
seems necessary.","And
the finale is strange and illogical.; However, as
time passes by, he slowly develops an appetite for power and dominance and
becomes alarming like one certain famous historical figure.; Ideas are not developed and story lines
scatter all over the place without a clear destination.; She is more of a comical and pitiful
figure than a force that persuades anyone.; Production design, Roger Ford."
9995.0,Turn It Up,1997.0,"Gage has a succinct statement of 
human desires.; Gage has a succinct statement of 
human desires.; Since Diamond is aware of his
friend's devotion, he is willing to be dragged into Gage's
world of drug dealing, robbing, even tolerating the man's
murders.; Handsomely lit and shot 
by cinematographer Hubert Taczanowski, the movie is a real treat for the 
eyes.; Handsomely lit and shot 
by cinematographer Hubert Taczanowski, the movie is a real treat for the 
eyes.","The script doesn't offer any
reason why we should really care about any of these characters and what
happens to them, nor do these characters exhibit any qualities that would
consistently engage our interest.; Turn It Up isn't a bad film, content to be merely sluggish and generic.; Beyond the tired, predictable plot--and the equally
dull subplots, such as Diamond's fed-up girlfriend (Tamala Jones) and the
sudden surfacing of Diamond's long-absent father (Vondie Curtis-Hall, way
beneath his league here)--there's some truly abysmal dialogue (Diamond's
raps are invariably described as ""hot"") and acting to match.; Filmed in New York and Toronto, ""Turn It Up"" does not
even enjoy an exotic Caribbean locale as did another turkey,
Chris Browne's ""Third World Cop,"" and it sure as heck has
no-one who possesses the charisma that Sam Jackson gives
to the sizzling remake of ""Shaft.""; What's a poor guy gonna
do?"
10016.0,Ghosts of Mars,1999.0,"This strong actor gives a visceral boost to the tale.; Society has changed
a bit by that time, but it has advanced surprisingly little.; It is, in fact, surprising that Carpenter managed to
fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an
admittedly novel way.; Of course much is implied at the beginning, when Ballard tells 
about returning alone, handcuffed to the train, which arrives via automatic 
pilot.; He can
be reached by e-mail at bloom@journal-courier.com or at bobbloom@iquest.net.","it becomes most
repetitious and boring.; Even what is supposed to pass for witty repartee between Henstridge's Ballard
and Ice Cube's Williams seems forced.; For a writer and director of horror films, supposedly an expert on
horror, it is a very bad mistake to make.; Ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie, Ghosts leaps
from one convenient moment to the next, stopping only to kill the
characters which are most convenient to lose.; As Desolation, Ice Cube's lack of acting talent turns
into an asset, making his stilted dialog come across as campy wit."
10023.0,Dragnet,1998.0,"Dan Aykroyd grew up in the 50s and 60s; later in improvisational comedy
he often drew on television personalities he saw during that time.; The story--c-authored by Aykroyd--is an extended parody of
the DRAGNET TV series.; ""Yeah, Frank?""; Aykroyd plays Joe Friday--not *the* Joe Friday but the nephew of *the*
Joe Friday.; Aykroyd's Friday, for some unexplained reason, has been able to
inherit the famous Badge 714 from his uncle as well as the same clipped
speech pattern and the same self-righteous attitude.","Aykroyd can talk like Webb but is a
total failure at writing like Webb.; One wonders how someone can do so many parodies
as Aykroyd has and still not have the slightest idea of how to do a parody.; While Aykroyd's
impression of Jack Webb is pretty much on the money, overall the imitation
of DRAGNET is miles wide of the mark.; In the old TV shows, sentences of more
than four words spoken by anyone were only slightly more common than scenes
of Friday shooting up heroin.; Take out
Aykroyd's character and the only similarity to the object of the parody is
that both involve police."
10029.0,Very Bad Things,1994.0,"Jeremy Piven is excellent as Michael, imbuing him with a great manic 
energy.; The character is an explosion waiting to happen and Piven, known 
for his intense portrayals, perfectly captures Michael's hair-trigger 
emotions.; The cast is great, with Slater playing one of his best roles in years
(Reminiscent of his psycho role in another great black comedy, HEATHERS
(8/10)), the rest of the boys also come through like gangbusters, and
Diaz plays the role of the ultimate wannabee bride convincingly.; His intense performance captures the demonic,
unscrupulous and completely amoral Boyd, who doesn't hesitate to act
when he recognises his smoothly laid plans beginning to unwind.; Most surprising is Jeremey Piven, who does a great job of going
bonkers as the film progresses.","It starts off pretty bad, then gets VERY bad.; If you have the stomach and want to
kill time, Very Bad Things is a mildly amusing 100 minutes.; But perhaps the worst thing about ""Very Bad Things"" is that after all
the hype, all the trailers that made it look like the hippest black
comedy to come our way since the dawn of Quentin Tarantino, it is
ultimately forgettable, and seems to be a direct miss in what Berg was
hoping would happen.; I guess the film was
trying to make these guys unlikeable, but sadly they come across as
seriously irritating.; But this bachelor party has gone about as bad as it could possibly
get."
10054.0,Spy Kids,1995.0,"Rodriguez, who
previously worked as a comic strip artist UT-Austin's The Daily Texan
(as did our Editor in Chief, Christopher Null), deploys that creativity
throughout the production of Spy Kids, showing off sharp directing,
amazing set designs, inventive spy gadgetry, great acting from his cast,
and a fast-paced script that is action-packed and hilarious from the
first frame to the last.; Altogether, it's a sharp and witty, action-packed film
that will entertain the kid and adult in all of us.; It's also imaginative, well cast and 
quite funny.; And Juni, who conquers fears so intense that they used to 
cause warts, shows how a youngster can summon the courage within him to 
rise to the challenges of a treacherous situation.; ""Spy Kids"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen so far in the year 2001, 
and is the best kids movie so far.","There were still about 15
minutes before that film was to begin, so I decided to
sneak into an adjacent theatre to kill some time.; Surprisingly from the man who directed violent movies such as ""Desperado"" and 
""From Dusk Till Dawn"" there is barely any violence let alone blood or gore in 
this movie.; They watch as
secret agents are transformed into bizarre creatures with Silly Putty
faces and used as background characters on Floop's TV show.; I
didn't expect to stay too long because the idea of
watching a pre-teen brother and sister team lurch
their way through a mission to save the world seemed
like an agonizing idea.; Had Rodriguez added a few more scenes like that, I would have enjoyed
the film more (and I definitely could have lived without the glaring
product placement for a certain Mc-ubiquitous company)."
10126.0,Colors,1989.0,"Haskell Wexler's cinematography (he shot John Sayle's MATEWAN last year)
is excellent as ever.; The name ""Dennis Hopper"" instantly evokes images of the darker side of
human existence, both in his films and his personal history.; Music by Herbie Hancock.; It is true
that Hopper's film teeters just to the edge of exploiting the violence, but it
does step back from the brink of gratuity enough to maintain a hold on reality.; This unification of form and content carries the
viewer inside the scene, and as Wexler points out, ""With any traditional camera
system, we'd have needed space for both the crane and the operator.","Hopper and scriptwriter Michael Schiffer have no idea
how to integrate women into the machismo of the world they are recreating on
screen, and they would have done themselves and the audience a service had they
excluded Alonso entirely rather than mishandling her character so poorly.; It
basically tries to snatch up a microcosm of this area, and (admittedly ignorant
of the area) it seemed successful in that.; The film urgently wants to point out how communities are
being raped by gang violence but then comes dangerously close to telling those
in such communities to either move out or bear it because there's no solution.; The
get-together quickly degenerates into a shouting match, and no progress is
made.; In another scene, the same social worker
who spoke to the residents tries to encourage some gang members to straighten
out their lives."
10128.0,Alien Nation,1996.0,"The show's well-done and worth
watching.; Patinkin's gentle sense of humor, his immigrant's
love of America (to the aliens, America truly is a land of freedom), and his
outrage as the plot unfolds, endears him both to us and to Caan.; A good matinee-price film.; Both create
characters who are complex (and in Caan's case, not particularly likable), yet
who mesh very well towards the end.; And I hope they are happy with what they got.","What was purported to be the year's biggest science fiction film is a
huge disappointment.; Just that somewhere along the line there was
a terrible failure of imagination, and the whole thing turned into a TV cop
show.; Gunfights with the
same old sorts of guns get boring.; The alien makeup is all right if
scientifically unlikely, and all other visual effects of the film have tires
and fenders or bullets.; CAPSULE: Tired and thin attempt at genre-mixing: Aliens Are Among Us meets
Crime Story."
10141.0,Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,1947.0,"Not among the most remarkable films thirteen years ago,
DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS looks surprisingly good from today's
perspective.; The contest for ascendency between
     two gigolos still makes a very funny comedy, perhaps more so
     because it has less competition than the story had in 1964.; DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS is nevertheless very funny and
entertaining film that should be recommended as an example
of something that is rather absent in Hollywood these days -
stylish and well-crafted comedy.; The performances are top-notch, from 
the principals' to those of the supporting cast.; It deals in genuinely funny situations, not just
funny personalities.","The plot is, on the other hand, weak and serves as
nothing more than excuse for the series of scenes in which
two principal characters try to outwit each other.; With only minor changes to most of the script--if memory serves, most
of the film even has the same dialogue--the script has been effectively
recycled to make DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS.; For one thing, they show some of the best clips from the movie in the
previews (this was true for DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, at any rate); secondly,
they don't seem to lose much sleep over whether they've given away the plot to
their viewers (Roger Ebert is particularly bad about that); and finally, the
new crop of reviewers are really awful.; The chic 
Britisher is like an aging Don Juan; the dishevelled American, 
like  an aging child.; Martin is uncouth, looks like an unkempt ""Europe 
on Ten Dollars a Day"" tourist in sneakers and baggy chinos, 
acts like a parody of American not-so-innocents abroad."
10142.0,Casualties of War,1995.0,"I do think
the film is worth seeing.; On the plus side, CASUALTIES OF WAR regains some solid footing from
Brian De Palma's confident direction, which is unusually understated and
for once doesn't call attention to itself.; The film is a somewhat different film compared to many of the plastic
coated comedies, light hearted dramas, and big budget shoot them movies of most
summer far.; We see Fox has a good
Sargent.; But it is a change from the lighter films of the
summer.","In nearly every film he's made, Penn has played an arrogant
tough guy, and frankly, it's getting boring.; Most of the characters,
including Penn's, come across as unbelievable stereotypes.; Fox falls into a
tunnel entrance and gets stuck (I know some one who fell into a North Korean
tunnel and survived).; A clumsy and heavy-handed screenplay, which telegraphs the big
moments, also bogs down the film.; This film tries to be an accounting of one event during the war."
10146.0,Men,1992.0,"Still, ""Men"" is a sweet, innocent, droll film that
merits a little more attention than it got.; However, I
must confess that I enjoyed it.; I also enjoyed
watching short-haired Juliette Lewis (finally a good role since ""The Evening
Star"") and the lovely, sweet presence of Marissa Ribisi - they make their
characters human and heartfelt.; What a surprise to discover a fitfully good
film that no one ever heard of!; I was immediately interested because of the cast, and
of course Juliette Lewis is in it.","If ""Men"" sounds mediocre and a time-waster based on its scantly told story and
largely underdeveloped characters, then I would not recommend it.; ""Men"" does not feel complete, and has too many characters who drift around
without any insight into their nature (Pamela Segall's Jenn is one character I
wanted to know more about).; There are two major films I can think of that are not
talked about much or receive any merit.; ""Some Girls"" (the video title) detracts from the film's emotional
moments - this is not just another twentysomething, Generation X programmer
with bland stars from ""Dawson's Creek.""; If nothing else, this
film should have been called ""Women,"" as the women are really the ones who
dominate."
10153.0,Sphere,1998.0,"There is also an 
excellent score.; This is a fun film that will keep
you at the edge of your seat for the entire running length.; Nevertheless, it
seems always to come as a surprise when a film that boasts such
fine actors as Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, and Samuel L Jackson,
can be so ordinary.; SPHERE, the latest Michael Crichton novel to be brought to the
screen, is a physical and psychological thriller that keeps you on the
edge of your seat.; The actors all play their cards real well, with Schreiber pulling off a
good performance as the egghead astrophysicist, and Sam Jackson coming
through as the hairless mathematician with the uneven glimmer in his
eye.","This $100 million mess by
good director Barry Levison (Disclosure) is dull, long winded, and a huge
disappointment.; What a waste.; There is nothing worse than a poor ending to a movie and this movie does
not have a satisfactory conclusion.; Sphere tries hard to be an intelligent genre piece, but a weak and
convoluted storyline only leads to a disappointing experience.; Unfortunately, it's not bad enough to be an 
enjoyable Bad Movie, just bad enough to be tedious."
10154.0,Mickey Blue Eyes,1996.0,"This is
not award winning movie making by any means but it is a very enjoyable
film, well worth the price of admission.; For
what it is, I give it an A-, an excellent light, romantic comedy.; Well intentioned fun.; James Caan makes for
a worthy adversary, and although he is not the perfect choice for the
role, his veteran craftsmanship (gained from The Godfather) helps a
great deal.; Delightful.","She comes off as a
little irritating, and not very watchable at all.; It started with a skeleton of a cliched plot and then
apparently the writers started hanging jokes on it like ornaments on a
Christmas tree.; Although admittedly attractive,
Tripplehorn lacks the vibrance and charisma needed to fill the shoes of
Gina.; He's nothing more than a plot device, which is a shame.; Also, in ""Mickey Blue Eyes,"" Grant puts his 
comic skills at work like never before and garners several sizable laughs, 
especially in a scene in which he is trying to use a mobster accent in a 
restaurant, and fails miserably at it."
10155.0,U Turn,2001.0,"Other major pluses are
the superb performances by all, brilliant cinematography and a terrific
soundtrack full of Peggy Lee songs.; In fact, all the
performances from Stone's motley cast are a delight - Penn's
encounters with mechanic Billy Bob Thornton and town punk Joaquin
Phoenix are hilarious, and the leading players are obviously enjoying
the seediness Stone wants from them.; U-Turn features brilliant performances by nearly everyone in
the cast and there are several exciting sequences.; Although Stone may not operate on the edge in U-TURN, his Academy
Award winning cinematographer Robert Richardson does.; Nevertheless, Stone has a personal staple he puts on the film, and all his
technical stuff works this time in creating sheer paranoia, and giving the
film a nightmarish edge that it needs.","This seems to be a fly-speck town where everybody either has a
dark secret or is working full time on getting one, and too many of
these plots involve Cooper.; But
by this point we do not care particularly what happens to Cooper who is
not particularly likable, even less smart, and who basically floats
like a cork and generally is acted upon rather than acting himself.; ""U-Turn"" has some of the style of ""Natural Born Killers""
with almost none of its satiric sting or kinetic energy, and the
result is a clunky black comedy with only a few scattered laughs
breaking up a monotonous cruise.; Billy Bob Thornton
plays Darrell with a face caked in grease like a cartoon character who
just walked into an explosion and with teeth that looks like he's been
eating dirt.; Unfortunately, it fails to come together in the conclusion,
which just piles one twist on top of another."
10158.0,White Men Can't Jump,1988.0,"We see in
great detail how the two get along, how they occasionally don't get along,
and how basketball conquers all.; And he has a natural advantage.; The game is his whole life.; The bet is that you are to play against Sidney and one other person of
      your choice.; We see how each relates to ""his woman.""","But if the hustle doesn't work the whole film makes
      no sense.; The story off the
     court is basically pointless and has holes large enough to
     stuff a basketball through.; While some of
the basketball photography is okay, in terms of dramatic tension it
degenerates into the cliche of slow motion photography.; Another security guard favor?; And that one over there can't dribble a
      basketball without tripping."
10174.0,Madonna: Truth or Dare,1995.0,"This film was quite well done and edited together very well.; MADONNA: TRUTH OR DARE is interesting to watch and I highly
recommend it to anyone interested in Madonna, or in what it is like for
a performer on tour.; The film is very well done and is worth checking out from your
local video store.; Parts of
the tour that are included in the film are what the dressing rooms were
like just before performance time, and how her dancers got along with
each other.; The film is a documentary about what life is
like for Madonna, backstage on tour.","The ads for MADONNA: TRUTH OR DARE, when the movie was in the
theaters and just before it came on to video, made the film look like it
was all sexually oriented.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; The
concert footage was done in color, the part that Madonna taped was done
in grainy black & white, and the rest of the film was shot in black &
white."
10209.0,Hideous Kinky,1999.0,"Director Gillies MacKinnon(REGENERATION, A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE) has
crafted a spritual gem, scripted by brother Billy.; The beauty of Marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of Kate
Winslet, as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its
bustling street scenes, expansive views, illustrious mosques, and grand
sunsets.; But HIDEOUS
KINKY is an independent film that takes us to places we've never been.; It is rare for children to dominate a film, especially
when matched up against Kate Winslet, who gives one of her better
performances.; The family's travel, which is on the edge, has Julia waking up screaming
from dreams that are bleakly haunting; but, when she gets up, all there
is, is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is
starting to bother her.","The book possesses ruminations which do not
translate to the screen, particularly since ""Hideous Kinky""
lacks the sort of narrative that we either loved or hated about
""The Thin Red Line.""; After a reasonable amount of time has elapsed, the picture comes to a
completely predictable conclusion.; None of the characters were interesting enough to care about when the
movie was on.; But I got the strange sensation that
the setting and the characters are part of two entirely different
stories, and the movie just isn't very engaging because of this.; Without much information, the viewers are left to piece together for
themselves what the director is trying to say."
10212.0,Ravenous,2000.0,"But jokes aside,
this is a film that is well worth watching.; The outpost is a small one,
staffed by only eight people, but Boyd doesn't mind: it sounds like
the perfect place to recuperate from his recent combat trauma, not
all of which is physical.; It is the power of the human mind and conviction that make
miracles happen.; But for all those of you who are
sick of seeing Hollywood churn out one old TV-show-into-a-movie after
another, enjoy a little bloody fun, and don't have a problem with people
discussing the benefits of eating human beings, you will most certainly
relish this flick.; But, for those individuals with an acquired taste
for an original story with their carnage, this unique little bloodbath
could spell genuine fun.","Almost any of the 
other cast members would have been far more entertaining adversaries.; Sadly, RAVENOUS delves into the predictable and silly faster than
you can say ""fava beans.""; The movie is much too long to justify a
plot this miniscule; a more liberal fat-trimming during the
editing stage (or a better script) would have made it more
watchable.; Antonia
Bird, whose movie features only a single female, goes for the
gore instead.; But
no: the tale repeatedly goes for cheap shots and cliche'."
10216.0,Species II,1998.0,"Many films (especially sci-fi ones) create similar timelines
as our realistic one, but change it to fit the film's needs.; Mykelti Williamson gives an enjoyable performance, and he
gives the film a more down-to-earth feel.; Marg Helgenberger is immensely better this time around, and her
performance is probably the best in this film.; It's well made, well acted, and
quite intelligent.; And the obligatory big-alien battle in the
conclusion is surprisingly well-done.","It's just boring, overdone, ugly, offensive, disgusting, and awful.; What a waste.; The movie is terrible; it's a poorly-acted, exploitative film with
a heavy-handed, ludicrous plot full of continuity holes.; As Marg Helgenberger utters after witnessing a spectacularly gory
corpse:  ""This is awful...just awful.""; So here comes SPECIES II, with a new creative team (director Peter
   Medak and screenwriter Chris Brancato step in for Roger Donaldson and
   Dennis Feldman, respectively) that fails to improve the series one
   iota -- like its predecessor, SPECIES II fails to capitalize on a
   potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from
   ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid."
10218.0,Swingers,1993.0,"I highly recommend it.; With a
hilarious witty plot, and great acting, I fell in love with this little
gem.; It's a great and witty plot, and
watching these guys stumble over themselves is wonderful.; SWINGERS is a touching little film with an endearing performance
by Jon Favreau as unlucky-at-love Mike.; Although it's hilarious at the time, it also seems a bit strange, but
the film eventually finds its niche through character interaction.","This is a good idea, but becomes
annoying when they give him mostly wrong advice.; whatever's ""in"" at the time) is
way too big to be a cult flick.; The problem with that logic, is that this film
doesn't look original, it looks and feels like all those other Tarantino
clones.; SWINGERS (director: Doug Liman; cast: (Mike) Jon Favreau, (Trent) Vince
Vaughn, (Rob) Ron Livingston, (Sue) Patrick Van Horn, (Charles) Alex
Desert, Heather Graham, Deena Martin, Katherine Kendall, Brooke Langton,
1996) An independent film, shot for around $250,000, that lacks a cutting
edge, something indie films should not leave home without.; And yes, Doug, that Aaton-III camera is *way* too loud."
10219.0,Snow Falling on Cedars,1946.0,"The last scene is 
particularly one of subtle, but unavoidably impassioned beauty.; ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" is a rare gem, that doesn't follow the simple path
most courtroom thrillers take.; Kudoh and Hawke have wonderful on screen chemistry together, most of the time
tense and unstable, without a word being spoken, which adds to the realness of
the situations presented to the viewer.; This clever tactic
succeeds triumphantly, telling a complex story with deep meaning without a hint
of wear and tear, delivering some of the most powerful, heart wrenching scenes
in a motion picture this year, many without a word of dialogue.; The court scenes are truly excellent and even solicit memories of 
classics like Inherit the Wind.","Unfortunately, that is not enough to sustain this snail-paced feature.; It just
drifts like a ship lost in a fog.; I merely walked out unsatisfied,
wondering why the story, like bad journalism, had to bury the lead.; Shots of rainy forests, and 
water dripping off of the leaves of plants, and snow-blanketed trees and 
mountains and whole, wide landscapes left me wondering if it was actually 
real (for it surely looked awfully believable), or billions of tons of fake 
snow, or a visual effect.; The second problem is the directorial self-indulgence exemplified by
that ""Dear John"" sequence, which shows up at every possible wrong time."
10220.0,Rounders,1995.0,"It's enjoyable.; Packed with great
acting and great characters, ROUNDERS is a full house.; But his noir-bred gift for creating an atmosphere
of mystery and suspense makes for some tense and exciting poker matches.; There have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the
""noir"" mood, that is, the dark, shady atmosphere where the vices of the world
become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life.; His strong,
emotional, real performance, helps you feel what he lives, his ups, and
downs, his desperations, elations, yet pull towards a predestined force
inside him Rounders hits, more than it misses.","Part of the problem is in the script and its 
reliance on mossy cliches.; The relationships between all three characters are unconvincing, playing 
simply as contrivances of the screenwriters to get all the cast members 
into their proper positions for the card games.; Five cards and
chin-high stacks of colored chips are the only reason anyone does
anything in this movie.; But there is simply not enough original material here to warrant 
devoting much of your time to it.; Worm is a complete screw-up."
10234.0,Funny Games,1968.0,"The film is 
all the more effective for the performances of the two boys, especially 
Arno Frisch who manages quite unnervingly to swing between a perfect 
mannered politeness and casual sadism without the slightest change in 
expression - one moment insisting his tormentees stop screaming and 
start referring to everybody by their first name, the next breaking 
people's legs with golf clubs.; This film succeeds with the
small share of the  audience it can garner, because it is, surprisingly
enough, an entertaining film, and it broaches a subject that is very
difficult to understand, that tweaks our interest in seeing if there is
anything new to say about violence.; Anna's resolute behavior and her human foibles make us
sympathize with her, even more so, even if we are not particularly
enamored by the way she deports herself when she is in control of
things; and the son's confusion touches us deeply, as we see him look
for direction to his now helpless parents, a nightmare for any parent,
to be in a situation where you can't protect your child.; But, by playing with the public's prurient
interest in violence as a way of life, something they have been numbed
into accepting as part of their television and MTV inheritance, this
powerful story has a chilling affect on rationality, questioning the
viewing habits and the responses to violence the public has.; Haneke also manages to be surprisingly playful.","They have no redeeming human features,
and their cruel intent is played up for the camera's benefit, Paul even
winks at the camera, as if the audience is in on this game they are
playing.; By crafting an intelligent screenplay and not going for the
unnecessary showing of gore, much of this is done off-screen, which
might be almost as horrific as seeing the actual mayhem, the director is
able to keep the film arty.; These thugs are complete fakes, even their names
are fictitious, as they keep referring to themselves with different
names, such as Tom and Jerry, Beavis and Butt-head.; I stayed to see if this
sadistic film works its point of view out, and I was disappointed that
with all its novelty and games and pretenses to high art, it offered
nothing much in the way of seeing things differently.; An incident, which is comical 
in its gaucheness, where Frank Giering comes to borrow some eggs but 
keeps dropping them suddenly, unexpectedly turns violent."
10264.0,Hamlet,1990.0,"HAMLET is definitely worth seeing on a big screen.; I particularly
liked Helena Bonham-Carter, who gives a really strong performance as
Ophelia.; My favorite of the cast was Ian Holm as Polonius.; HAMLET is a superbly-produced version of Shakespeare's play, with
strong performances all around.; I've
never been a particularly big Close fan, but this is the best of her
performances that I've seen.","Unfortunately, she was rather bored by it.; The
worst aspect of his performance to my mind was the fact that he almost
always came off as second banana to me whenever he was playing against
someone else.; I'm not sure why--the killings aren't
particularly brutal, there isn't much in the way of bad language, and
the sex is only implied.; I'm not a purist, so a lot of the cuts didn't bother me overmuch,
other than my occasionally reacting, ""Waitaminute ... isn't there
supposed to be a scene with so-and-so here?""; Helena Bonham-Carter
came alive as Ophelia descends into madness, but unfortunately played
the character as so thoroughly dull as dishwater earlier in the film
that I was almost (note: almost) unable to feel much for the character
later."
10276.0,What About Bob?,1997.0,"Murray is both funny and tender in
the role of an obsessive-compulsive agoraphobe coming out of his shell.; serves up Bill Murray's most delectable character,
and performance, in a long, long time.; is a film starring Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss.; Richard Dreyfuss is his new, ambitious, success-obsessed doc.; Leaving the auditorium, I felt I had been entertained, albeit in a
rather predictable, formulaic way, but, yes, I had had a pretty decent
time back there in the dark with Bill and Richard.","Tom (DEAD POETS
SOCIETY) Schulman's disappointing script becomes more and more contrived
until--THUD--the movie ends with a painful belly flop.; Unfortunately, the rest of the cast doesn't measure up: Richard Dreyfuss,
as Bob's put-upon psychiatrist, is untypically uninspired--and Jill Hagerty
(who plays Dreyfuss' cookie cutter wife) gives what will probably end up
being the worst performance of the decade.; Okay, for matinee
prices it's okay.; They're cute, they're sort of funny in
an icky way.; Which means mugging, smirking,
doing this eye-thing with the camera that says hey watch me I'm being
pretty cute over here."
10278.0,Return to Paradise,1998.0,"Anne
Heche gives a good sentimental performance as Lewis' lawyer, who shows
grit and perserverance as a fighter who is always patient with the two
men who face the ultimate decision.; RETURN TO PARADISE is a rare film experience.; He does a great job of keeping the pace of
the film, and doesn't let up near the end, but unleashes several great plot
twist.; This is a very powerful, intelligent, and thought provoking film.; Return to Paradise is a movie that has a great morality play.","That
is, there is nothing particularly special about it, but nothing truly awful
either.; --
Alex Fung (aw220@freenet.carleton.ca) | http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~aw220/
""...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
 sponsor is generally a pathetic fetus of a film, nothing more.""; He
directed this predictable drama with a heavy hand as it lapses into
melodramatics after a very emotionally moving start and after presenting
a most interesting premise; it is just too bad that the script had no
conviction to follow through on its premise.; The only scene that made sense from this point on in the story, was the
one where Tony's fiancée (Vera) asks some intelligent questions of the
lawyer and fails to illicit responses that would make me want to go
back.; It's just one that doesn't live up
to its potential."
10285.0,Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday,1965.0,"I liked that.; The very first scene, is in fact, terrific, as it sends up all the
horror cliches that the FT13 series helped spawn.; Honest.; On the other hand, that was actually a
very decent film, one of the best in the series, and by the time JGTH
had ended, it had gone up another notch or two on my personal
Respect-O-Meter.; Especially as we reach the tail end of the film, when
all is revealed whether we want it to be or not.","It's not even the worst Friday the 13th
film we've ever seen.; The script could have been written better, but as far as
horror movies go, the writing isn't that bad.; Without a doubt, THE FINAL CHAPTER is the worst ""Friday the 13th"" movie
in the whole series.; Despite a legacy of horrible
previous efforts under the FRIDAY THE 13TH umbrella (of which I have
seen only three--parts 1, 2, and 8--all on cable), this film actually
has a few good elements buried amidst all the dead bodies, dumb
dialogue, and mystical nonsense.; For the html version of this review with screen captures, please point
your browser to http://members.aol.com/stomptokyo By this, we mean that Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday is not the
worst horror film we've ever seen."
10312.0,Patch Adams,1987.0,"But, it is a decent film and I would recommend for those looking for an
""enjoyable' film.; I laughed, I cried,
I felt that wonderful tingle up my spine in so many parts.; Through a combination of a strong story, 
brilliant acting, and overall power, Patch Adams is one of the best all 
around films of the decade.; This is definitely a MUST SEE movie.; It s one of the best that I've
seen in years, and it's wholesome.","It's just not
funny.; The nefarious dean gets the worst
of the cliched lines.; The main reason:
a complete lack of subtlety on behalf of its screenplay.; First
of all, he's given several moments for ""improv"" comedy (most of which
are too awkwardly staged to be more than mildly amusing).; Patch Adams is meant to be an inspiring and uplifting film,
but it is also a horribly saccharine, clichéd and cynically
manipulative movie that wears its heart on its sleeve."
10314.0,She's All That,1987.0,"Laney's father, played
with warmth by Kevin Pollack, is fascinating in his
own right; I liked his clever ""warm-fuzzy"" speech about
living one's life to the fullest.; Prinze, who gave a wonderfully 
subtle, complex performance in the delicious black comedy ""The House of 
Yes,"" does solid work here, infusing his character with a nice blend of 
uncertainty and earnestness.; With that in mind, I was pleasantly surprised to
find myself enjoying much of ""She's All That.""; I'm not in that range, but I
still found the film quite enjoyable since some of the situations will hit
home for many of us.; Kevin Pollack (The Usual Suspects, etc)
also delivers a nicely underplayed performance as Laney's father, who
initially seems to live in a different world from his two children,
but who ultimately turns out to be sympathetic and understanding.","The acting is nothing to write home about.; The number one reason is that the message of this movie is
terrible, terrible, terrible!; It's a bad, bad, bad movie.; Of course, had the filmmakers attempted to try
something new with this material, the well-worn storyline would have been
a device to propell the movie forward.; There's not one original or interesting character in the film, either, and
if that wasn't bad enough, there's not one good performance featured."
10324.0,If Lucy Fell,1997.0,"Best friends since college, these two have developed a more 
intimate (albeit platonic) relationship than most lovers.; IF LUCY FELL brings Schaeffer into the world of big budget Hollywood,
where he has adapted quite well, bringing another fresh and extremely
funny comedy to the screen.; (Actually, one of the
better of films of 1994, as I recall.); Schaeffer's writing provides nonstop laughs for a solid 50 minutes
before the film settles onto the steadier track of how IF LUCY FELL
inevitably ends, but those are a fun 50 minutes, enhanced by some great
supporting characters and subplots.; IF LUCY FELL was
written, directed, and stars one of our most promising up-and-comers, Eric
Schaeffer, whose docu-comedic first (independent) film, MY LIFE'S IN
TURNAROUND, was a sleeper hit in 1994.","Star-writer-director Schaeffer should not have been allowed to even come
close to a movie set, let alone be allowed to make this totally predictable,
unfunny, waste of an hour and a half of anyone's life.; And 
the far-too-predictable ending is both contrived and manipulative.; There's no chemistry between any of the characters.; The conclusion is far too tidy and convenient.; The result is that this film, which wants to be 
smart, funny, and hip, succeeds instead in being mostly irritating."
10326.0,Forever Young,1999.0,"It is, despite playing fast and loose with laws of
thermodynamics inter alia, an excellent entertainment: a romantic
fantasy, just torrid enough to melt even this reviewer.; He is simply perfect in the part of the
resuscitated test pilot searching for his past ""across oceans of time,""
to borrow a phrase from another movie that might stand as the dark side
of this one.; Brief, but memorable.; This is probably
the romantic story that a lot of his fans have been waiting for.; Elijah Wood is the
fatherless boy who finds Gibson and wants to keep him with a desperation
that is nearly palpable.","In a Dracula movie, this is not a problem.; I can recommend FOREVER YOUNG to you, even at full prices, but go
to a cheap matinee if you can.; LATE FOR
DINNER was better on all these counts; unfortunately, LATE FOR DINNER
did not have the star power of Gibson or his butt and so never attracted
the audience it deserved.; Unfortunately, the director and writer made a couple of egregious
mistakes in visualizing how a sleeper adapts to a changed world and how
a person ages.; Isabel Glasser is Gibson's love in
the 1939 sequence in an promising debut."
10329.0,Congo,1998.0,"A tightly
scripted ride with John Patrick Shanley's screenplay bristling with
enough hair-raising stunts, gags and frights to keep you hooked.; CONGO's greatest asset is that it's the only pure monster movie/
adventure of the season, and, even obviously flawed as it is, it still 
fills a niche left vacant by the CRIMSON TIDEs, BRAVEHEARTs, and 
BATMANs.; The end result, for the undiscerning, is good fun.; Although the studio-based finale looked like, well, a studio based
finale, and the sight of the heroine slicing up loads of simians would
leave Dian Fossey turning in her grave, it's an old-fashioned, cut and
pasted blast.; Not
having read the novel, I had no expectations so was pleasantly
surprised by the quest for diamonds by a big wig corporation; a super
smart gorilla's return to its home and, based on arachnophobia, the
chance for Marshall to show us whether he can recreate the sense of
white-knuckle panic only really attainable by throwing hundred of
deadly spiders at a wary audience.","The movie doesn't even get bad *enough*, which is the worst bit of
all.; However, the plot synopsis only shows one thing--the utter
silliness of the plot, and a silly plot is not enough to make a movie
bad.; The screenplay was terrible.; The worst disappointment of
them all was probably CONGO, 1995 adventure thriller
directed by Frank Marshall.; She (the ape) looked bored too, not even trying to do sign language,
just hitting her chest in the same way every time, perhaps thinking
""Duh!"
10342.0,Teaching Mrs. Tingle,1993.0,"I was kept on the edge of
my seat by the end, and was glad I got to see this movie.; But the film moves along at a good pace and is a breath of
fresh air from the thankfully forgotten teen horror genre.; Everyone in this film is great.; Holmes is an instantly likable screen presence, and her calm and poise
grounds the film in some level of reality and plays well off of newcomer
Coughlan, who has the showier role as the kooky aspiring actress Jo Lynn.; Some surprising revelations are found towards the end, which
makes Mrs. Tingle a whole new person.","As a director, Williamson fails to make the grade with this
inauspicious debut.; For finer Williamson,
rent that 1998 sci-fi lark and skip this messy melodrama.; No hip lines, no cheap thrills, just a
dull time at the movie theater.; Material that could have been enjoyable
is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the
director.; Either choice might have salvaged
TEACHING MRS. TINGLE, which instead opts for absurd sincerity."
10351.0,Wishmaster,1973.0,"Well-worth the watch, Wishmaster has become to me, a
camp classic, and one of my favorites.; As does Tammy Lauren,
she does a great job as her character, and gets realistically into it.; Wes Craven produced this stylish, well-made, and extremely gory, and great
movie.; Her final thought
of defeating him is brilliant.; But what got me the
most, was how fun the movie was.","The result is 
dull, lifeless, and devoid of even minimal chills.; The bad news is that the whole business is pointless, a foolish stab at
internal logic in a genre where internal logic matters far less than what
kind of mayhem a Djinn can inflict when someone wishes for a ""wild party.""; Makeup artist-turned-director Robert Kurtzman's idea of a good scare
is a phone that rings ridiculously loudly or a masked actor who pops in out
of nowhere to startle someone.; Tammy Lauren is a very weak and uninspired lead.; If ""Wishmaster"" wasn't so unintentionally hilarious, it'd probably be a 
long, wooden bore."
10354.0,True Crime,1977.0,"Eastwood himself delivers a solid performance as the cynical,
determined reporter, a role that perfectly suits his laconic screen
persona.; But TRUE CRIME is a film definitely worth
seeing, especially for a great perfromance by Isaiah Washington, as an
accused man approaching death.; Woods is very funny, and his
chemistry with Eastwood is terrific.; Eastwood elicits typically solid performances from his ensemble cast,
   particularly from Washington, who turns in a reserved performance
   vastly different from his work as a violent would-be rapist in OUT OF
   SIGHT; he lends Beachum a nobility and dignity that renders his
   momentary emotional lapses especially stirring.; Washington is superb and lends dignity
to his portrayal of Beachum, while Lisa Gay Hamilton (recently seen in
Beloved) is touching as his wife.","Nothing interesting, much.; Instead, it's just another mediocre product of only
relative worth.; But hanging on the bones of this predictable plot is the
unrealized potential for a much better film.; Wonder if this is
just a potboiler for Clint to make other, better movies.; In all fairness you can't blame Clint for the dull plot."
10357.0,Volcano,1999.0,"The wonderful MD to the
teenager:"" Kelly, I know you're scared.; And very believable.; His character
becomes at once both funny and strong.; I liked this movie...but it was not as great as I hoped.; Kelly, with a second degree burn, is taken by the wonderful lady MD to
the now apocalyptic Cedars Sinai Hospital.","If you want to waste 
your time watching a boring, stupid disaster flick (literally, it almost 
grossed half of its budget), see this.; Jacqui Kim (DISCLOSURE) takes the poorly written role of the noble
Dr. Jaye Calder and transform it into a mildly interesting character.; ""Earthquake"" has got to be one of the worst movies of all time, but at 
least they had the joke of having Charlton Heston sleeping with 
Genevieve Bujold.; They and the millions of dollars that went into this virtual
re-make of dozens of movies could have been better utilized.; Volcano looks cheap and not very sure of itself."

""Universal Soldier: The Return"" is a action-packed, homicidal 3 -
aimed at diehard kickboxing fans.; She follows Deveraux around so that she can get an exclusive,
inside story.; Michael Jai White plays the human incarnation of S.E.T.H.","The appalling script might be forgivable if the movie had any
creative action sequences or anything original to offer.; The script fails to take any real risks as well.; The result is a predictably lackluster flick.; The scene in which
his character complains that he doesn't want to be stereotyped
resonates with an unintentional irony.; At least, that is, until it becomes
painfully (if unsurprisingly) evident that Goldberg can't act a lick, and
his one showcase scene, where he rips off his shirt for no apparent
reason and dispatches some foes using some wrestling maneuvers, just
makes his presence in the film even more ludicrous."
10371.0,For Richer or Poorer,,"Distributor: Universal Pictures The winter holiday season box office sweepstakes is on, with 
Paramount opening TITANIC, Fox weighing in with GREAT EXPECTATIONS and 
HOME ALONE 3, Warner Brothers sending out THE POSTMAN, Dreamworks 
releasing AMISTAD and MOUSEHUNT, Miramax debuting JACKIE BROWN and GOOD 
WILL HUNTING, Disney blinding us with MR. MAGOO, and Columbia/TriStar 
showing AS GOOD AS IT GETS.; ""For Richer
or Poorer"" is in no way as sharp or witty as the year's best
comedy, ""As Good As It Gets,"" but offers enough laughs and
sentimentality to include in your repertory of holiday
moviegoing.; The rest of the film follows 
them as they grow to appreciate the simple way of life, and, in the 
process, fall in love again with each other.; She was part of TV's ""Cheers"" ensemble cast from 1987 to 1993.; Possibly inspired by the marriage of Donald and Ivana
Trump, ""For Richer or Poorer"" is a sentimental comedy that
preaches the benefits of moderation on all sides.","Sounds too boring?; The script is, to put it mildly, uninspired.; CRITIQUE:
Uninspired, predictable, and mostly unfunny comedy that joins TRIAL AND
ERROR (4/10) in proving that for some reason, Hollywood executives like
to correlate bad comedies with longer run times (This one clocks in at
a little under two hours.); The worst part about this movie is that even the lame attempts at
humour are marred by adult content, which disavows any kids from seeing
this dud on video.; What ensues is a badly scripted and
horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell."

nonetheless is very good, and the two scenes that work, flashbacks to 
Christmas 1988, when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother, and to 
Halloween 1993, when Lou crashed her son's birthday party in a drunken 
stupor, are effective because of the realism Ryan brings to the situations.; Kudrow, Keaton and
Ryan all give strong performances.; Since the three
women are what we would today call smart, they are highly
verbal, spending a good deal of their energy both at work and
at leisure vocalizing in person or especially on the
phone.","Boring, trite 
filler at that.; ""Hanging Up"" is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is the only one 
I can think of that made me want to pull out a gun and start shooting at the 
images onscreen.; Maddy is so forgettable that one might have done better to fill
in her role by using stock footage from ""Friends.""; Throw in a
pointless and mildly offensive subplot about an Iranian doctor (Duke
Moosekian) and his mother and you've got a real yawner of a first act.; This movie can be summed 
up in a single phrase: the Ephron sisters (Nora and Delia, co-writers of 
this dud) need to keep their boring Issues to themselves."
10390.0,For Love of the Game,1996.0,"I thoroughly
enjoyed it's loving tribute to a great game, and anyone with similar
feelings is sure to agree.; This is definitely an adult drama featuring many moments of
heartfelt emotion, and despite not being for everyone, it may just be the
best romantic drama since 1997's AS GOOD AS IT GETS (8/10), and certainly
worthy of a comparison to the strength of JERRY MAGUIRE (7.5/10).; For seven innings, the film shows his life in flashback as he broods on
the owner's request, his brilliant career, his relationship, and his
love of the game.; Young Jena 
Malone is beautifully cast as she matches perfectly Preston's looks.; Young Jena 
Malone is beautifully cast as she matches perfectly Preston's looks.","It just could have been better.; 'For Love of the Game' is written by Dana Stevens based on the novel by
Michael Shaara and is directed with ordinary tendencies by Sam Raimi who
made 1998's 'A Simple Plan' which was very depressing but was better film
making than this movie which has absolutely no memorable qualities
whatsoever and is just another exercise in telling another love story which
neither convinces us that the people involved really care about each other
nor does it do anything for the game of baseball.; If Kevin Costner really does have a love for the game of baseball, why would 
he agree to make something so shamelessly weepy and manipulative, in which 
not more than one or two scenes are even credible, and the rest is pure 
fantasy-land?; Scene after scene we 
watch these two attractive stars, but without a trace of any sharp writing to 
support them, aside from conversations that are linked exclusively to the 
plot, what we really have are two attractive stars who have zero chemistry 
and are so dull and uninteresting as individuals that pairing them up means 
only one thing: a motion picture disaster.; Kevin Costner is adequate as Billy Chapel, who has ""mid-life crisis"" written 
over his forehead like a neon sign, but why should we care about someone with 
no distinguishable qualities or interests, outside of baseball?"
10398.0,Double Jeopardy,1998.0,"The always wonderful Ashley Judd plays Libby Parsons, a woman with a seemingly
normal life: a great loving husband, a beautiful son and a great friend.; It moved at a fast pace, has suspense, humor, heart and great
acting.; Simple stuff.; Fun, exciting, and suspenseful,
Double Jeopardy gets *** stars.; Even though a lot of critics didn't like the film, I loved it.","*1/2 out of four
This is your definitive ""Hollywood"" movie, extremely predictable, following the
basic formula (a horrible ending), overzealous writing (meaning the writing was
bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting, therefore
making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space) and
if Tommy Lee Jones and his lovable wise-ass character (of which we've seen
before in The Fugitive and quite frankly, wasn't used enough here), I'm afraid
the film would have been completely unbearable.; Have you ever seen a film that could possibly have been successful, but was 
basically ruined due to an ad campaign that gave away literally every secret 
the picture has to offer?; Tommy Lee Jones doesn't do much for the film, and actually doesn't have that
big of a role.; Unless you're a fan of that genre, 
I suggest you simply watch the commercial and save 105 minutes of your 
life.; Director Bruce Beresford spends way too much time
trying to convince the audience that Libby misses her
son."
10409.0,Strictly Ballroom,1978.0,"If you lean towards THE PLAYER, go
see this film for the touching parable of growing up, and overcoming
repressive unquestioned ""traditional values.""; Strictly Ballroom is a
fun film that can be seen by people of all ages.; Even though you
probably know the way the film will end you will have fun getting there
and will be surprised by plot twists in between.; The movie is funny, energetic, and enjoyable--the perfect film
for a night or an afternoon out, no matter what your mood is.; Though it remains to be seen how American audiences will warm to
this quirky film, it's been picked up for distribution in 86 countries,
and was voted audience favorite at both the Toronto and Cannes film
festivals.","Also, at least in Morice's case,
it's nice to have someone in a starring role who doesn't look like she
belongs on a magazine cover.; Instead, I'd like to point out some similarities to
the 1992 ice skating flick THE CUTTING EDGE, of which I was strongly 
reminded while watching STRICTLY BALLROOM.; The character of Shirley Hastings (Pat 
Thompson) becomes less amusing and more annoying with the passage of 
time, and the wonderful chemistry between Scott and Fran sputters a
little.; Why would anyone want to go to a film about the cut-throat,
competitive world of ballroom dancing, that some critics might be
tempted to label as a cross between DIRTY DANCING and FLASHDANCE?; Who c Scott Hastings started to go
wrong."
10412.0,Romper Stomper,1999.0,"All in all, ROMPER STOMPER,
through its naturalistic and unrelenting portrayal of modern
society's darker side, represents one of the most
interesting and most impressive films made in previous
decade.; Pay close attention to
the scenes of fast paced violence and you will notice teens who have
passed the degree of hatte that most humans never achieve.; What you end up withis one of the
most interesting and compelling foreign films of recent years.; ROMPER STOMPER is at times very powerful and
thought-provoking film, but this impression might be diluted
with some of less fortunate creative decisions.; These days the film is less known for
its controversies and more because of its principal actor,
Russell Crowe, whose role in it was probably the most
impressive before his future Hollywood triumphs in L.A.","Whole
character of Gabe and the subplot involving her father looks
like an unnecessary diversion from the main story.; However, the real test of
filmmaker's courage comes when unpleasant issues are
approached from even less pleasant perspectives.; Those three words describe not only that scene but infact the entire
film which contains material that will affend most.; The only
assistance comes in the form of Gabe (played by Jacqueline
Mackenzie), epileptic young woman from well-to-do family,
but her presence would turn out to be the reason of Hando's
final downfall.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
10413.0,Nowhere to Run,1998.0,"This is an unusual move for a picture of this type, so, to minimize its
impact, the script makes sure that the viewer realizes what a nice guy
Sam is.; That's not to say that it's a
tremendously original finale, but at least something about it is a
little different.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; When magnanimous offers to buy the land fail, the pair resort
to terror, but Sam's presence creates some unexpected complications.; It's apparent that NOWHERE TO RUN's best asset is Rosanna Arquette,
who puts spirit and energy into a fetching portrayal of Clydie.","NOWHERE TO RUN isn't a complete waste of time, nor is it terminally
boring, but, as action/adventure pictures go, this one is closer to the
bottom end of the scale than the top.; There
are a lot of cliches floating around in NOWHERE TO RUN, and every facet
of the storyline is predictable.; Drama lovers (few of
whom are likely to venture into a theater showing this film due to the
reputation of its star) will have a hard time swallowing all the
banalities.; Unfortunately, few of these scenes work, mainly because of a too-obvious
reliance upon formulas, not only for setup, but dialogue as well.; Surprisingly, there isn't much action in NOWHERE TO RUN, at least
in comparison to Van Damme's previous films, and this is one of the
reasons why the movie misses its mark."
10416.0,What Planet Are You From?,1993.0,"This fine DVD is
certainly a great way to see it.; For a
very funny script, a surprisingly good turn by Garry Shandling, and a great
supporting cast, I give ""What Planet are you From?""; John Goodman (""The Big Lebowski""), who I believe is
one of the best comic actors in Hollywood, is hilarious in his role as the
one man who thinks he knows the truth.; What 
really worked about it for me is the sense of fun the characters and 
actors seemed to have with each other, from Susan kickin' it with her 
girlfriends Liz (Anne Cusack), Alison (Camryn Manheim), and Madeline 
(Nora Dunn) to the comic interplay between Shanning and the surprisingly 
funny Benning - and especially Goodman, one of the funniest Big Men in 
Hollywood - the laughs were easily drawn out of me, even I as sat there 
determined not to laugh at this movie.; Greg Kinnear (""Mystery Men"", ""As Good as it Gets"") is perfect as the king of
sleaze balls everywhere.","* - One of the worst movies ever made.; * * - Pretty bad, see it only if you've got nothing better to do.; But in a year (so far) where damn near every 
movie seems to be striving for inclusion on ""Worst Of"", you could do 
much worse than to spend 100 minutes of your time with a few good 
bellylaughs and a chuckle or three.; is listless, lame and limpid.; The segment contains way too
many pointless side stories that would have made the movie better if they did
not exist at all."
10419.0,Swing Kids,1992.0,"It is
an irresistible package of great music, good dancing, and an important
story.; The choreography and energy of these scenes is excellent.; However, the American film is good,
effective, and interesting in its own way.; Peter is in no way as conflicted as the Salomon
(in EUROPA, EUROPA), and SWING KIDS is in no way as gut-wrenching or
mind-twisting as the German film.; Not only does it provide
several fine performances, including Frank Whaley as the intellectual
and musical center of the Swing Kids and Barbara Hershey as Peter's
frightened mother, as well as Kenneth Branagh as a slick, oleaginous
Gestapo officer (and when you write tell me why Branagh chose to
receive no credit for this part), but it also gives us several well
integrated dance scenes and lots of wonderful swing music.","Barbara Hershey is completely wasted.; While the two leads, Bale and Leonard, have
been competent in previous roles, they are merely adequate here, and
sometimes not even that.; Aside from the aforementioned problems, the plot is lacking when
it comes to originality.; The need to sanitize this film to make it palatable
to mass audiences has robbed SWING KIDS of much of its power.; Trivializing Nazism is never a smart move."
10423.0,Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story,1997.0,"So go see it and enjoy the movie.; The physical
resemblance may not be perfect, but Jason matches Bruce for energy and
screen presence.; Though the fight scenes are well-filmed and
believable, this movie is equally as good for its focus on other
aspects of Lee's life, such as his relationship with his wife and
children, his conflicts with the Chinese martial arts community, and
his desire to prove himself despite racism in America.; And the fighting
scenes were all excellent.; DRAGON is a fun experience, but far from a great film, and those
expecting a probing examination of Bruce Lee's life are likely to be
disappointed.","Dramatically, there isn't a whole lot of substance to DRAGON.; It seemed as if he was no better than
anybody else.; Scenes like Bruce delivering Chinese food as a delivery
boy ridding a bike through the American college looking at the
(all-white) students, cheerleaders, and athletes.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

10428.0,Hackers,1978.0,"As with Sneakers 
it manages to present an atmosphere that is very unique and one that
continues to grow on you long after the film is over.; Although at times it too may seem a little far fetched, it
should be much more believable than HACKERS to regular computer users.; Hackers is very much a 'youth' film, a piece that's very obviously 
pitched at the cyber-generation (as is evident by the very cool 
soundtrack), but it has a lot to recommend it to a more mainstream 
audience - not least of which being a script containing some of the 
funniest and most natural dialogue I've heard for a long time.; Everyone gives a very 
energetic performance, no one really jumping too much into the fore and 
allowing for people to play off each other with both style and wit.; What
wonderful teenagers these kids are.","With an uninteresting script and no plot to
speak of, the movie is one long MTV video set in a computer-
generated landscape.; Hopefully, this film didn't influence too many young computer users out to
think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time.; Why bother
recabling phones locally when you can bounce calls through half a
dozen relays?); HACKERS is certainly the worst movie I have seen in years and will
rank in infamy for me as one of the worst I have ever seen.; To sum it up, HACKERS is a terrible computer film."
10435.0,Chaplin,2000.0,"CHAPLIN is an excellent film, which I highly recommend that you
see.; It is a good film and one of the best I have
seen lately.; She does an
excellent job with both roles.; She does
a great job.; This film is very well written.","Unfortunately, this is another instance where the script fails.; As intellectually intriguing and satisfying as it
is, the movie fails to touch enough emotional chords to make it of more
than passing interest.; He doesn't
add much to the film though.; Attempting to condense seventy-eight years into one-hundred
adn forty-four minutes is a Herculean task that not even a director of
Richard Attenborough's accomplishments is up to.; And, my feeling is, some of the
material was not epic to begin with -- that might well be my serious
gripe with this film."
10440.0,Manhattan Murder Mystery,1996.0,"This is a solid Woody Allen film, not unlike some of his earlier
comedies (ANNIE HALL and PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM come to mind, though this
is more realistic).; Combined with numerous one-liners, almost all of which work,
are several instances of well-timed and well-executed physical humor.; As always, the
compound insanity that he delivers, the one liners that insult himself and
New York, and other things that convince you that you may not be the
craziest person in the world make the film entertaining.; It is, 
however, a hilarious comedy that works 90% of the time, and has enough 
to get the viewer through the other 10%.; Allen has great fun putting his habitual 
persona in the thick of a murder mystery: his paranoia and anxiety are 
played up to good effect, as he offers a running commentary of fear 
and doubt throughout each escapade.","Over the years
Farrow had become more and more like some parody of a female Woody
Allen, and her manner of perpetually whining would have been completely
inappropriate for the confident and focused Carol.; A word has to be said about the annoying cinematography of Carlo
Di Palma, who returns after causing audiences motion-sickness with his
wobbly, hand-held camerawork in HUSBANDS AND WIVES.; Oooh, 
he must have just killed someone.; That's all it takes for Diane to contemplate conspiracy.; Allen could have stopped at the painfully funny scenes of the 
couple yelling at each other over their flirtations."
10443.0,Fearless,1991.0,"Jeff Bridges, who tends to play his roles with more stoicism than 
emotion, finds the right balance.; This
performance shores up my judgment of Bridges as the best American
leading actor around, and it almost holds FEARLESS together on its
own.; Perhaps not 
unexpectedly, the two embark upon a deeply-emotional and highly-unusual 
friendship.; This is one of those rare films that gets the audience to think while 
still telling a gripping story.; One of the most emotionally-wrenching scenes in FEARLESS is a group 
therapy session where survivors relate their memories of the crash.","This tangent of the story doesn't work for two basic reasons.; Not only in Hulce totally unconvincing, but this 
particular element of the story is pointless and distracting.; There is so much untapped potential here that it seems a crime for 
director Peter Weir to give it such cursory treatment.; Screenwriter Rafael
Yglesias, adapting his novel, doesn't have the guts to really attack
Max's arrogance, and Weir lets his Christ imagery (Max probing a wound
in his side; Max making mud from his saliva) just sit there without any
irony.; Then,
rather abruptly and much to the worse, it shifts gears into fairly
run-of-the-mill family drama."
10445.0,Shadowlands,2000.0,"She brings a gritty
worldliness to Joy Gresham that compliments perfectly Lewis'
intellectual spirituality.; Winger played a harsh, honest, strong, complex and yet vulnerable
character.; Edward Hardwicke, best known to American
viewers as one of two Watsons in Grenada TV's SHERLOCK HOLMES
mysteries, gives a solid portrayal as Lewis' elder brother, Warnie.; It has an excellent ending.; And when she travels to England with her son, Joy
discovers a common bond with her favorite author--a bond that is
tested by friendship, love, and illness.... SHADOWLANDS is a delightfully unobtrusive film.","Oh
well, she tried.; Early on, with an on again/off again
urban New York accent, Winger's a bit of Streisand doing a lettered OWL
AND THE PUSSYCAT, and Nicholson's screenplay provides her with some snap
and crackle with Hopkins and another don but nothing quite pops.; I still can't figure out EVERYBODY WINS: is the script as
badly written as it exposes itself to be on screen?; I could say more, but I would only be repeating commendations
already made in this newsgroup by Berardinelli (SHADOWLANDS.2331) and
Renshaw (SHADOWLANDS.2332).; Or worse,
it could have been a Malcolm Muggeridge bliss-out."
10447.0,No Escape,1996.0,"However, unlike FORTRESS who had the similar
flaw, this film offers quite a different feel.; Ray Liotta is a good actor and I enjoy him in just about anything.; The story introduces Robbins (Ray Liotta), a Marine captain con-
victed of murder and sent up the river and across the ocean to an island 
penal colony with no guards and one rule: stay alive.; It is the future.; Everyone dreams of freedom but excepts their new life.","However, Stuart Wilson as chief villain is
almost laughable, proving again (same as in LETHAL WEAPON 3)
that he lacks adequate charisma for such task.; This film mostly is
watchable, but then, as many other similarly forgettable
action films, everything culminates in predictable yet
unbelievable and lame finale.; Cross MAD MAX with LORD OF THE FLIES and you've got the idea behind 
NO ESCAPE, a lousy prison-in-a-jungle pic.; It tries to form characters, tries to form plot
twists, and fails.; For some time, it looks like the
film might leave the audience with something to think about
- nature of evil and violence, but then it all boils down to
predictable and cliched prison break subplot."
10448.0,Rapa Nui,1998.0,"A little further East and into Thailand, CHANG from
the directors of King (Cooper and Shoedsack), still ranks as one of the
finest ethnographic films ever made.; Despite many flaws, RAPA NUI is a
film that can leave a strong impression on any viewers, and
after WTC bombings, when the future of our world seems so
uncertain, this impression is definitely going to be even
stronger.; What is even
more remarkable about this film is the fact that the whole
story can be seen as powerful allegory about the current
state of human civilisation as a whole,.; Unlike other films that try to shove the Message down our
throats by, RAPA NUI successfully shows how greed, ignorance
and unbalanced approach towards environment can bring down
entire civilisation.; The writer and director Kevin Reynolds nevertheless manages
to keep things under control, helped by ethnically diverse
and very capable cast.","Not much is known of true Rapa Nuian practices, but instead of an
informative film based on similar cultures, writer director Reynolds
(with the assistance of co-writer Tim Rose Price) make the worst paint
by numbers coloring book level fable.; Instead, the scene plays like bad out
takes from the pyramid scene in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.; Cut to a futile but increasingly elaborate attempt to fid
a way out through religion (the giant moai figures) and then, abruptly
but predictably, to population crash and no more civilization at all:
just a barbarized, starving semi- cannibal remnant hiding out from each
other in caves, stone age survivalists in an apocalypse of their own
making.; Esai Morales, a fine Hispanic
actor (BAD BOYS) is totally miscast as the Marxist-atheist rabble
rouser who spouts on about religion being the distractor of the masses
as if a premature copy of ""The Communist Manifesto"" had washed up on
the beach.; The
painful and painfully slow machinations around the egg hunt swim fill
up much of the multi-pronged plot."
10481.0,102 Dalmatians,1998.0,"It's brilliant.; Alonzo makes a great nervous butler.; Mrs. JoBlo loved it!; Evans is a bit too squeaky clean as Chloe, but Gruffudd is 
charming as the boyish Kevin.; Starring Glenn Close, Gerard
DePardieu, Ioan Gruffudd, Alice Evans, Tim McInnerny and Ben Crompton.","Instead of being actively
irritating, this one registers as merely tedious.; Itís just fails to offer anything
extraordinary.; 102 DALMATIANS would have had to work hard to be as actively
irritating as its John Hughes-penned precursor.; Indeed, Walt Disney is rolling over
in his grave again, cursing John Hughes' name for making the original
live-action 101 Dalmatians, one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time,
and now its sequel.; But that's only half the problem with Kevin Lima's laborious film."
10490.0,Drop Dead Gorgeous,2000.0,"Like 1997's marvelous mockumentary, ""Waiting 
for Guffman,"" ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" captures small-town life dead-on, but with 
an obvious satiric edge, and is entertaining from the first frame to the last.; Drop Dead Gorgeous is a hilarious mockumentary, which will go down as one of
the funniest movies of the year, and also the best film about making a
documentary.; Now for me to say that it becomes good, (from great) is a marvelous compliment
for this underrated, overlooked film.; Barkin is absolutely perfect as the trailer trash mother to Amber.; Kirstie Alley is
equally perfect as her mother, not for a second showing a bit of kindness
towards the other contestants.","But this year
seems to bring out the worst in its competitors.; A bad attitude.; It's unfortunate because the premise of the film seemed ripe for
parody with some funny characters brewing within, but for me, only a few
chuckles trickled out here and there, but mostly I was shaking my head and
thinking ""this is just stupid"".; Besides its lack of consistent humor, I also found that the film ran a
little too long, had one really exaggerated and unfunny retarded character
who was just embarrassing, and many, many missed opportunities, including a
flat ending.; Jann's direction lacks focus, although some of the film's barbs
manage to strike home."
10494.0,Perfect Blue,1994.0,"But criticisms aside, Perfect Blue is, nevertheless, well worth the
accolades and awards it's received.; ""Perfect Blue"" isn't quite as perfect as the title 
suggests, but it is still a film that I could easily recommend to those 
searching for something a bit more original than the norm.; But Perfect Blue may
be, in my opinion, the best Japanese animation in this years Singapore
International Film Festival.; ""Perfect Blue"" is wholly animated, a genre usually known in
the U.S.  for children's features by studios like Disney, Dreamworks,
and Warner Bros., but in Japan a type of filming taken with deadly
seriousness to display violent, shocking, psychologically compelling
themes.; Also, Perfect Blue is also a murder mystery.","The film fails to work up enough scenes inside Mima's head to suggest
that as her acting career takes a turn for the worse, Mima's begins to
yearn for her past.; The main problem is that too much of the dialogue seems canned and
sappy.; Unfortunately, instead of being subtitled, the film has been dubbed in
English and although it's not that bad for an English dubbing effort, at
every turn the dubbing undermines the effectiveness of the film.; Or
is her entire showbiz career a figment of fantasy?; Unfortunately, PERFECT BLUE is nothing more than
visually exhilarating, and the reason is that too much is lost in the
dubbing from its original format."
10531.0,Death and the Maiden,1999.0,"She is excellent here as
one of the angriest and bitterest women you will ever meet.; But DEATH AND THE MAIDEN is
powerful, intelligent, and suspenseful for those willing to try it.; The cast is superb.; It is a sense of reality that works
well.; Sometimes the surprises come as unexpected twists in the
plot (as in CHINATOWN or FRANTIC) and at other time in how harsh and
intense the way the characters are drawn (as in BITTER MOON).","Sigourney Weaver is the worst of the small cast.; Instead, the
mystery is why they couldn't make the material work.; Stuart Wilson, playing her husband, isn't much better.; In fact, a fair impression is that too much effort went into
this aspect of the production, leaving little remaining for such minor
details as plotting and acting.; Unfortunately, as it plays out,
the performances and direction make our choice far too easy for us."
10548.0,When We Were Kings,1993.0,"He *was* The Greatest: he embodied his ambitions
perfectly.; This one is a
must-see!; He was not only a great champion, but highly
entertaining as well.; Beyond 
creating an exceptional documentary, Gast reminds us of the majesty of 
Muhammad Ali, a man who was, and is, a hero for the ages.; The film is full of surprises from the training to the fight
itself, but getting to know the legendary Ali is worth the price of the
movie ticket.","We must whop Mr. Tooth Decay.""; That kind of incompleteness is common in WHEN
WE WERE KINGS, as Gast introduces a situation then fails to follow up on
it.; MPAA Rating:  Not Rated (brief nudity, profanity, boxing violence)
Running Time:  90 minutes.; Foreman, meanwhile,
could not understand why he was treated like the villain, or worse,
ignored entirely.; Yet Gast appears to deal with the actual fight as a
necessary evil, or as padding to fill out a documentary about something
else which was struggling to make feature length."
10549.0,Hamlet,1996.0,"But, not surprisingly Paul Scofield, and Ian Holm struck me as the
most effective actors in the movie.; Glenn Close was a
wonderfully sympathetic Gertrude, and Alan Bates had a lot of fun being
a slightly gluttonous and lustful Claudius.; ""Mel Gibson gives a fine performance as Hamlet.""; I have to admit I underestimated him, and he does
a great job with speaking the lines with understanding, clarity, and
above all, acting through them.; Scofield, with the tiny role of the
Ghost nevertheless makes a lasting impression, and Ian Holm steals the
film in his scenes.","""That's *two* of his weapons..."" because he
wanted the final scene to look like a bash-em-up fight/duel with big
blades, and then climax with them swinging two big swords apiece, rather
than have anything so finicky as a four-bladed-fencing-match-with-wimpy-
foils-and-daggers.; I think most of the cuts were
probably necessitated by the commercial need to bring in a film under
three hours.; which was from the scene
before which didn't have the soliloquy ... you start to wonder if maybe
there wasn't a little *too* much violence done to the text.; We've got too many Hamlet's leaping around in doublet and
hose as it is.; Yeah, right,
like Hamlet hasn't figured that it's not a blunt blade.)"
10551.0,Family Business,2000.0,"Broderick is surprisingly good as the grandson.; Sidney Lumet is an excellent director of the urban scene, and especially
strong at portraying the jungle of New York City (""Network,"" ""Serpico"").; Although Sean Connery gives the most picturesque performance, it is sketchy
and overdone, while Hoffman makes the most of his torn-loyalties part and
Broderick nicely underplays his underwritten role.; Sidney Lumet is one of the best of American directors.; FAMILY BUSINESS ** (1989) Directed by Sidney Lumet.","Why do so many talky asides diffuse and dilute the movie?; (Near the end a dumb, simplistic explanation
is given).Why does Vito yield  to entreaties?; FAMILY BUSINESS is bad business.; The idea has some merit but is
unexploited.; The nasty people in this film are people
who deal in real estate and lawyers, and big corporations, each of whom is
made to look worse than the others."
10557.0,East Is East,2000.0,"Both lead performances are excellent.; All the Khan children are excellent as well.; All the Khan children are excellent as well.; As a result, _East_Is_East_ is one of the
rare films that gets to have the best of both worlds: hit serious and
true emotional buttons while delivering a genuinely fun time.; At about 96 minutes, it is
charming in its own rugged way, a film you can appreciate as well as
enjoy.","I thought it was cheap, offensive, unimaginative and peopled entirely
by racial and class stereotypes of the most crass kind.; I am not saying that a
writer or a director has any kind of duty to present ""PC"" depictions of a
particular race or group, but merely to pick up on a dominant racist
carricature and reinforce it uncritically like this seems to me inexcusable,
and frankly lazy.; Presumably
it is supposed to be excused by the fact that it was written by an Asian.; The direction by Damien O'Donnell is capable
but not particularly noteworthy.; Rated R.  Running Time: 96 minutes."
10559.0,Frequency,1987.0,"This film delivers on all fronts: solid acting, a
well-told and surprisingly believable story despite its fantastic premise,
some cool special effects, an emotional tug and plenty of thrills.; Maybe it's a little too Hollywood
at times but nevertheless it's enjoyable.; Those missteps aside, ""Frequency"" is mostly fun and often
touching.; Director Gregory Hoblit (FALLEN
and PRIMAL FEAR), aided again by David Rosenbloom's perfectly timed
editing, delivers a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and
a heart-warming father-son story that comes along as a wonderful bonus.; It's quite amazing the 
film is able to string together a
story about tracking down the same killer both in the past and the future.","* - One of the worst movies ever made.; It looked awful.; * * - Pretty bad, see it only if you have nothing better to do.; Worse
than messing with Mother Nature is fooling around with the time-space
continuum, even if it is for such a laudable purpose as trying to save
your father's life.; The film also features some of the
worst make-up since Mr. Saturday Night."
10560.0,Center Stage,1997.0,"In fact, Susan May Pratt (Maureen) taps down a strong
performance as the prissy perfect ballerina soon to learn a lesson on self.; Refreshing, really.; It also 
marks a splendid showcase of both classic and modern ballet, and is the 
best of several such performances littered throughout the movie.; Fortunately, the answer is yes: ""Center Stage"" is by no means a milestone 
in movie history, but it is very enjoyable and even exceptional in 
certain respects.; Some of the more unconventional setpieces are the 
highlights, including one played to the hard-edged, rocking beat of the Red 
Hot Chili Peppers' ""Higher Ground,"" and a climactic scene between Schull, 
Stiefel, and Radetsky that is brilliantly choreographed and veritably 
effective, as it closely mirrors their relationships in real life.","It may not sound so bad as described, but that's because I'm recounting
the film without any taste of screenwriter Carol Heikennen's dreary
dialogue, Nicholas Hytner's overly earnest direction, or the truly putrid
performances by these unpromising acting ""talents.""; And since the writer doesn't want to
make a choice, she tries to shoehorn in way too many stories, all at the
expense of the dance sequences, which is the only reason to see the
movie in the first place.; And since the writer doesn't want to
make a choice, she tries to shoehorn in way too many stories, all at the
expense of the dance sequences, which is the only reason to see the
movie in the first place.; The male
choreographer's assistant notes that the girl has poor form.; Whenever she's not onscreen
or no one is dancing (with the exception of the climactic ballet, which
is supposed to be ""hip"" and ""revolutionary"" but is actually quite
ridiculous), _Center_Stage_ is one trying watch."
10563.0,Three to Tango,1999.0,"Perry give an entertaining performance.; Three To Tango's climax is a
hilarious, clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most
romantic-mistaken identity comedies.; Three To Tango's script, written by Rodney Patrick Vaccaro
and Aline Brosh McKenna is fun, fast, and funny, delivering not only original,
hilarious gay jokes (not your run of the mill material), but a certain
snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling.; The Bottom Line: Three To Tango is a light, sharp, snappy romantic comedy with
a superb ending, and great stars.; Three To Tango is a gem.","The most disappointing aspect of the film is the utter lack of
originality in the plot.; The attempts at humor are cheap, as 
typified by a spectacle of twin vomiting, by scenes of irrelevant, 
vague ""comparses"" such as Oscar's and Peter's pals who are no more 
than wooden furniture sitting on furniture.; McDermott plays a
generically icy corporate shark, and he has even less to work with.; Uh oh!; Were
Cranky able to set his own price to Three to Tango, he would have
paid... Three to Tango is probably an OK dateflick if there's absolutely nothing
else of interest to you."
10564.0,Where the Heart Is,2000.0,"Along the
way, she even helps others triumph over their own adversities.; For all the surface eccentricities of the story, which derives from
Billie Letts' novel of the same name, Matt Williams' film follows a
simple course where a good-hearted woman is placed in adverse
circumstances and then slowly but surely triumphs over them.; Portman, on the other hand, remains natural and genuine throughout.; Juno now offers FREE Internet Access!; It should--this is the rubric for the genre that I've come to
call the ""Oprah movie"": slick, well-meaning, female-empowering, and just
about as exciting and suspenseful as the middle label implies.","She's too young and vibrant a performer to pigeonhole herself in films
like _Where_the_Heart_Is_, which are precious and nice but hardly the
most interesting and effective uses of her talent--not to mention not the
most interesting and rewarding films to sit through.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

10571.0,Boys and Girls,1998.0,"I had to 
ask myself how long this relationship could possibly last, but for now it 
makes for an entertaining romance that is sure to please teenagers and adults 
alike.; Nonetheless, ""Boys and 
Girls"" is sweet, innocent fun that makes you wish it were so much more.; Primarily spanning 
the first three years of Ryan's college experience, he and Jennifer gradually 
become best friends, their varying personalities a perfect fit to help each 
other out in their relationships when they most need it.; The soundtrack for the film is very good, and there is a great scene 
where Jennifer takes Ryan out to a club where they dance to âCar Washâ?; My favorite part of the 
movie is when Megan first approaches Ryan and directly asks him out.","The dialogue is
probably the worst I have ever seen in any movie,
mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring
script and the ridiculous words these characters use
is what Hollywood thinks kids can relate to.; ""Down to You"" was the 
second film, inferior to ""She's All That,"" and ruined by a mess of a 
screenplay and Prinze, Jr.'s amateurish performance.; The appealing actors can't make up for a large amount of very stupid and 
rather pointless lines.; An example of an insightful
conversation: (Well it's not as bad as Wing Commander I guess) The supporting cast is also painfully useless.; I could hardly sit through the 93 minute
running time for several reasons."
10577.0,Dracula 2000,1996.0,"In fact, the revelation at the end of this movie about
the origins of Dracula is both unique and believable.; Send to: johnbeachem@dependentfilms.net Past reviews can be found at:
http://us.imdb.com/ReviewsBy?John+Beachem * * * * * - One of the best movies of the year.; Now, that is a fascinating vampire 
film with some real imagination.; Afterall, Dimension 
brought us Scream and From Dusk Til Dawn; two films which 
perfectly combine horror and comedy for a rousing good time.; Seriously
though, this flick is sure to be a nice treat for anyone who enjoys vampire
flicks and heavy soundtracks, and those who don't mind a new twist on a
renowned character.","Oh and what a waste of time this movie is.; Dracula 2000 runs far too long 
at 127 minutes.; Lussier also wrote and edited the film, which only one he did successfully, 
the writing is not that good at all, and this film I can safely say has a 
terrible script, with some bad dialogue and bad jokes, however the editing is 
fantastic and Lussier seems to be able to do at least one thing good.; I
was expecting bad acting, plot holes galore and some pretty bad effects.; The trailer was pretty lame and it basically looked like
another generic teen horror flick with Dracula in there just for kicks."
10598.0,Dirty,1999.0,"It was both a sad and funny picture, one that I
would highly recommend for those who are not afraid of seeing some very
graphic, 'dirty' sexual scenes, that fit the story to a tee.; He makes good use of
Leigh's improvisational way of shooting a film and has created a nifty
contemporary film, with frighteningly real sex scenes and recognizable
characters who have modern urban problems.; It explores their
problems over loneliness, sexuality, and coping with life.; The acting is subtle (Babz
Chula's performance is mesmorizing), while, the story, though not
reliant on plot, is emotionally strong, showing how all the individuals
are tangled up in knots.; David is so
consumed by Angie, that he is prepared to destroy his life over her.","He is awkward around females, managing to say or do the wrong
thing, which repels them.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; His
schoolwork also suffers because of his deep sexual problem."
10603.0,George of the Jungle,1994.0,"Expecting another Disney film suitable solely for younger children,
I was most pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing from
beginning to end at this live and lively version of George, suitable
for adults as well as kids.; The 
film delights in its own daffiness, and the relatively short running 
length avoids overkill.; My son Jeffrey, age 8, thought it was ""great!""; We know
this because there is a narrator's voice (Keith Scott)  with a great
sense of humor, who fills us in on anything we ourselves may not be
aware of.; The story is very simple.","Their script is a mess,
heavy on slapstick pratfalls (""when in doubt, have George slam into
something"" seems to be their philosophy) and groaner one-liners, light on
anything resembling a plot--and without any dramatic structure, the film
seems to drag on and on and on (and then some) without any rhyme or reason.; Depending on your point of view, this film is either truly awful or so
bad it is good.; Definitely a
candidate for worst film of 1997 (that honor still belongs to John
Leguizamo's 'The Pest' until I digest this one further) and one of the worst
films of the 90's.; GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE suffers from a fundamental, insurmountable split
personality:  it wants both to be a big, dumb comedy for 8-year-olds and
to make fun of the fact that it is a big, dumb comedy for 8-year-olds.; Alas, even that
is botched--instead of using the original version from the TV show during
the main titles, Weisman serves up an alterna-rock-inflected version by the
Presidents of the United States of America."
10607.0,Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,1999.0,"Singleton's work is the most 
frequently targeted:  the storyline is loosely based on BOYZ 'N THE 
HOOD, there's a scene featuring a girl reading a poem while music from 
POETIC JUSTICE plays in the background, and Omar Epps has a cameo on his 
way to HIGHER LEARNING.; The two Wayans, best known from IN LIVING COLOR, play friends 
Ashtray and Loc Dog, a couple of high school kids roaming the hood, 
getting shot at, impregnating girls, and being put in their place by a 
tough-talking, trigger-happy granny.; One lampoons STAND BY ME.; A few scenes stand out.; - James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","There are laughs 
to be had, but not enough to lift this film out of its morass of 
mediocrity.; DON'T BE A MENACE comes across as 
a poor sister to Keenan Ivory Wayans' I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA.; Unfortunately, this is recycled -- not cutting-edge -- 
humor.; United States, 1996

10608.0,Bob Roberts,1998.0,"Rickman is excellent in his
single-minded and frightening grimness.; ), who turns in an excellent and heartfelt performance as
Roberts' rival in the campaign.; His opponent is a patrician veteran, played
wisely and humorously by Gore Vidal (he improvised some of his own
dialog), an old-fashioned liberal who is cynical about the political
process even while remaining passionate about his vision of government
and the American spirit.; It is
original, fully realized, entertaining, smart, and chilling.; Robbins has acknowledged THIS IS SPINAL TAP (1984)
as his primary inspiration.","The actor that I think does the worst job was Gore Vidal.; The biggest problem that I noticed in this film is that Bob
Robert's music videos were not funny.; The problem that hurts this film is that the film isn't that
funny.; BOB ROBERTS starts off with a good idea, a folk singer who pops
into a government race and then doesn't do much (remind anyone of Ross
Perot).; Tim Robbins can't sing very well
either, which is not good when his character is a singer."
10615.0,Pootie Tang,1996.0,"I cannot remember any other movie without subtitles that creates a
language for its characters, but never teaches it to the audience.; I become relaxed, comfortable, with
a notepad in one hand and a pencil in the other.; Typical of the level of the comedy is the way that Pootie's father, known as
Daddy Tang (Chris Rock), dies.; Starring: Lance Crouther, Jennifer Coolidge, Chris Rock, Wanda Sykes,

Movie Fiends: Check out Amazon.com's Top 100 Hot DVDs!; Its humor tires not too long after the beginning
credits have finished rolling.","Even bad movies usually contain a few redeeming factors, but not this
one.; Pootie Tang stinks as badly as
possible.; We witness all kinds of incidences in a corny,
maundering, sarcastic style that is just not funny.; Here's the painful setup: We first learn that the entire movie we are
about to watch is actually a movie clip playing on a talk show featuring
an immensely popular celebrity named, you guessed it, Pootie Tang (Lance
Crouther).; Adapted from a comedy sketch on HBO's The Chris Rock Show, a major
motion picture should have been the perfect platform for the nest of
talent at the acclaimed Rock, but these filmmakers prove, like the folks
at SNL do every other week, that a five-minute, one-character TV sketch
just doesn't transfer to the big screen."
10641.0,Autumn in New York,1996.0,"And, of course, there's ""Casablanca,"" the greatest
love story of all.; One of my favorites is a
forgotten little gem called ""The Barretts of Wimpole Street,"" which
tells of the love affair of Victorian-era poets Robert Browning and
Elizabeth Barrett.; It brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it.; It's not necessarily a generation gap problem, although 
today we're much more sensitive to that than in the days when Audrey 
Hepburn was wooed and won by Bogart (30 years her senior) in Sabrina, 
Cooper (28 years) in Love in the Afternoon, and Grant (25 years) in 
Charade.; Surprising, Ryder is very good as Charlotte.","Heavy-handed screenwriter Allison Burnett is no Erich Segal.; After a while, it is all very tiresome.; This predictable, would-be tearjerker will leave you remarkably dry 
eyed.; Then there's the soggy dialogue: ""We have no
future.; It's just too bad the particulars of the 
film itself don't even come close to matching that one-of-a-kind 1979 
masterpiece."
10647.0,Pay It Forward,1997.0,"This is
best illustrated in a terrific scene with Angie Dickinson (playing a bag
lady), one of ""Pay It Forward""'s few genuinely touching moments.; This is a far different single-mom-
of-troubled-son-with-unusual-male-suitor than she played in ""As Good As It
Gets,"" although I'm willing to bet she gets criticized for replaying that role.; She
gives a gritty and strong performance as the alcoholic
mom.; Angie
Dickinson does good work as a bag lady and Jim Caviezel touches the
heartstrings as the desperate Jerry, although his doe eyes are played up
more than is necessary.; Techs are solid throughout.","Another completely
artificial and one-dimensional character showing up for only one
purpose...because the script needed someone to show up and mess things up at
that point.; It's stylistically bland and the
screenplay is weak.; And yet another character conveniently becoming a relation to
someone else in the film because it served the script, and nothing else (is
this a soap opera?).; A few good performances do not come close enough to saving this
poorly-conceived film.; Unfortunately, the Mimi Leder picture just does not have enough faith in
its central idea."
10655.0,Gettysburg,1997.0,"Both do solid jobs, and 
are especially effective at bringing out the more human sides of the 
officers.; This engaging film is almost a textbook about the battle and
because at the same time it is so enthralling, this is one of best and
perhaps in some respects is the best historical feature film ever made.; In what it manages to do, GETTYSBURG is an exceptional motion picture, 
but this is true even moreso for the manner in which it manages to do it.; Both played men of great foresight and courage,
though Longstreet was just passed his prime as a leader and Chamberlain
hadn't quite reached his peak (or may have just reached his peak at
Gettysburg).; More impressive than Berenger and Sheen are Jeff Daniels and the late 
Richard Jordan.","Further cutting would 
have reduced either the spectacle of the battles or the insight into 
certain characters, neither of which would have been desirable.; But actors seem to be chosen more for proven acting ability than
for marquee value.; GETTYSBURG, a far 
more ambitious project, had two major handicaps:  limiting the brutality 
of its depiction for the PG-rating, and getting far more extras into 
position (the logistics of this picture must have been a nightmare).; There are probably a few sequences 
that might have been trimmed without doing much damage, but the finished 
product would still have been around four hours.; (The presence of women,
incidentally, is limited to a count of two and a screentime of about six
seconds.)"
10660.0,It Could Happen to You,1995.0,"I rate it *** 1/2 and
highly recommend it.; IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU is not a great film, but it is an enjoyable
love story and a pleasant change from much gun-blazing summer
entertainment available in the theaters right now.; The movie starts wonderfully, ends great, and has perfect pacing
throughout.; It's easy to predict what's
going to happen, especially for those who have seen IT'S A WONDERFUL
LIFE, from which IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU borrows heavily (with Rosie
Perez taking on the Lionel Barrymore role!).; Although it is true, it is told as a fairy tale and,
moreover, a wonderful romance.","Here, instead of developing the minor characters
the screenwriter actually seemed to be working with a checklist to make
sure a wide variety of ethnic minorities were represented in the film.; How about
a show set in a poor ethnic neighborhood where the kids are nice, play
stickball and no one mentions the word drugs?; At its worst, Rosie Perez is on screen.; That's a real disappointment, because I expect better from Andrew
Bergman.; Also disappointing is the limiting of Stanley Tucci to three
scenes as Yvonne's wandering husband."
10683.0,Happiness,1942.0,"Highly Recommended.; That film bordered on sadistic at times, but
still retained a quiet, observant, yet very funny atmosphere.; Solondz draws wonderful and perceptive
performances from his ensemble cast that bring this collection of
colourful losers to life.; It's a harsh, shocking film, but it's also
touching and often funny.; The
cast is uniformly excellent, although Dylan Baker deserves special
mention for his portrayal of the paedophile father.","But even worse than that, it
pretends to be something terribly insightful and revealing, when really it's
just boring and obviously shocking.; CRITIQUE:
This is a bad movie.; Basically, this all amounts to a movie in which not a
person has a clue about anything, and they are all eager to
demonstrate that point in protracted, never-ending conversation.""; It's uninteresting and unentertaining.; I'm trying to think of one redeemable quality in this film, but I
just can't figure one out."
10687.0,Tigerland,2000.0,"In his stance as a rebellious leader, he helps many of the recruits in ways the
hypocritical Army trainers can't.; It's the tale of a soldier who won't conform to the Army and by the film's end
proves he's not a bad guy and can also be an excellent soldier if he wants to.; Shot by Matthew Libatique, whose resume includes such
surreal films as Darren Aronofsky's current ""Requiem for a
Dream"" and the even more experimental ""Pi,"" ""Tigerland""
affords by contrast a realistic look at an actual training
program.; _Tigerland_ is pretty much the story of Privates Bozz (Colin Farrell)
and Paxton (Matthew Davis), who bond and become best friends during
training at Fort Polk, Louisiana sometime in 1971.; Bozz knows all the angles in the Army base' bureaucratic procedures and uses his
knowledge to help his fellow soldiers beat the system, as he advises some on how
to get out of the service.","Rated R.  Running time: 109 minutes.; The clichéd hero and the formulaic story never caught my
fancy, no matter how much the director tried to make things happen.; The rest of the cast
is played as two-dimensional figures, simply filling in the background.; There's also
some liberal claptrap thrown into the storyline, which is unconvincingly done
about a racist sociopath.; And... that's about it."
10688.0,Hamlet,1999.0,"Known mainly to
American audiences as the man behind 1968's ROMEO AND JULIET (required
viewing for many high schoolers, and as much as most ever learn of
Shakespeare), he is also a favorite at the Metropolitan Opera, where his
achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a Puccini
aria.; But if you've ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the Bard,
this HAMLET is an excellent place to start.; Normally, I love Franco Zeffirelli and in fact one of my favorite
movies is his ROMEO AND JULIET which has great intensity and interest
in every scene.; And it makes this movie, like his
others, visual feasts.; The question is not
whether HAMLET is a good story, but rather whether this is a good HAMLET.","At worst,
moderately well.; She plays Gertrude poorly, you never get the feeling that Gertrude is
evil, just so stupid she falls from one man to another.; Rent HENRY V instead.; Scenes are shuffled, lines are changed.; Close's performance is not much better."
10696.0,Glitter,1998.0,"Almost
overnight, Billie rocks to the top of the charts, thanks to Dice's promotion.; In fact, one of the
most hilarious scenes is one of gratuitous body baring: Billie films her first
music video wearing a translucent wrap over a silver string bikini, but the wind
machine is too strong, and--whoops!--there goes the wrap!; ""Your voice - it's
incredible,"" says another singer.; The film opens nationwide in the United States today, Friday, September 21,
2001.; Filmed by Geoffrey Simpson in Toronto and New York, with 
some stunning footage from (sigh) the World Trade Center, the 
chic Soho neighborhood and Madison Square Garden, ""Glitter"" is 
awash with Terence Blanchard's score, featuring so many songs 
(performed by talent including Mariah Carey's own ""All my Life,"" 
""I Didn't Mean to Turn You On,"" and ""Loverboy"" plus an 
assortment of pop favorites by Stevie Wonder, The Strikers, 
Zapp, Whodini and others) that we in the audience are virtually 
MTV'd rather than able to enjoy whole pieces sung  passionately 
by Ms. Carey.","Watch especially for the poorly directed scene 
featuring Billie's walking out on Dice after the former has gone 
through a jealous tantrum and particularly for an unintentionally 
laughable juxtaposition of their getting together, as Dice and 
Billie, now living apart, seem to be communicating by ESP, the 
estranged couple separately composing a song as though they 
were in the same room.; Not surprisingly, it is the
only even mildly successful scene in the entire movie.; Because of the ridiculous clothing choices and silly hairdos -- the film is set
in the 1980s, but still -- Billie is a laughable character.; Problem is: her signature song, ""I Didn't Mean to
Turn You On"" is wretched.; Or, put it this way, if you
thought Madonna was awful in ""Shanghai Surprise,"" Mariah Carey's worse in this
reworking of ""A Star is Born."""
10705.0,Henry V,1995.0,"Even so, the Bard's sublime language is beautifully served throughout, the
players are humanized as much as possible, the first-time direction is
impressive.Notwithstanding some objections, this HENRY V is a top-notch
film. ""; He is arguably the preeminent
Shakespearean interpreter in the world today, and the best of all of
his works is this production of HENRY V. I've thought about what it is that makes his Henry V come alive
so, and it may come down to the basics.; For those of you not familiar with them,
Rattle and his orchestra are arguably the best Mahlerian interpreters
in the music world today.; First of all, his version is more faithful to
Shakespeare's text and it is more realistic.; Actually, Branagh's physical appearance makes gives him a unique
force of presence.","Instead, HENRY V
looks like full-blooded historical spectacle.; Emma Thompson (Branagh's wife at the time) speaks
atrocious French .; It is entirely feasible to create a shower of falling arrows
that your enemy must enter before he can even come near you, provided you
have brought enough arrows along.; Editing, Michael
Bradsell.; There is no sex, nudity, or bad language."
10710.0,Envy,1989.0,"),
they make for an exciting use of set design and wardrobe, providing an
excellent set of rules to toy with.; It whets the appetite, draws a little confusion, and sets up the
possibility for unconventional storytelling.; that gives Envy its step
above normalcy, its extra set of layers that make it worth watching.; Director Julie Money's Australian
feature veers slightly around the same old stuff and creates an
interesting and new mix of character study, role reversal, and sexual
politics.; It's obviously much bigger,
and in a framework that Kurosawa or Leigh would appreciate, it has to do
with class structure.","Cropper's got the load of
carrying Envy, and she performs well, save for some overly earnest
delivery here and there.; But is all this just about a missing dress?; We can sympathize when she explains to her oaf of a husband
why rape doesn't have to include actual penetration, but we wonder how
long she'll foolishly stalk her enemies.; Although Envy could easily have worked as a play, Money makes her study
solely cinematic.; The bulk of the setup is simple too - Kate (Linda Cropper), a married
professional with a young son, spies a gorgeous young girl at the local
pool, wearing what she believes is her stolen black dress."
10729.0,Quick Change,2000.0,"The odd thing about QUICK CHANGE is that despite its inadequacies,
it's surprisingly entertaining, thanks to the plot's imaginative twists and
turns.; ""Quick Change"" is a very funny film, right up there with ""Ghostbusters"" as
one of Murray's best.; That makes it one of the best comedies of
all time that no one ever saw.; There are plenty of laughs, and the level of comedy stays consistant
throughout.; That's a shame, it's fantastic entertainment.","QUICK CHANGE has the opposite problem: its clever plot is riddled
with lousy characters.; The gimmick is: all they have to do is get to the
airport and they're home free, but the entire city seems to be conspiring
against them.; An officious bus
driver (played by Philip Bosco) is as well developed as Randy Quaid's
character with far less screen time.; There are several
     well-defined characters created, but unfortunately the three
     main characters are not them.; Capsule review:  The clever heist story fades into a
     Murphy's Law sort of getaway."
10763.0,Dr. T & the Women,1986.0,"He is clearly a very good OB-GYN.. His interest in his patients is 
extraordinary,  personal, sincere as well as intelligent.; This ambiguous last scene also contains one of
the memorable shots ever shown in a commercial movie.; Although 
never losing his loose stylishness and quirkily realistic characters, 
Altman's last great film was 1993's ""Short Cuts,"" which, in fact, beared a 
close resemblance to his most masterful achievement, 1975's ""Nashville,"" a 
multi-layered expose of a week in the lives of twenty-four characters in the 
title city of country music.; Although 
never losing his loose stylishness and quirkily realistic characters, 
Altman's last great film was 1993's ""Short Cuts,"" which, in fact, beared a 
close resemblance to his most masterful achievement, 1975's ""Nashville,"" a 
multi-layered expose of a week in the lives of twenty-four characters in the 
title city of country music.; In standout 
turns, Laura Dern (1996's ""Citizen Ruth"") is exceptionally funny and 
entertaining as joyful alcoholic Peggy; Helen Hunt (1997's ""As Good As It 
Gets) thoughtfully underplays her complicated role as the idealistic woman 
Dr. T falls for; and Tara Reid (1999's ""American Pie"") is extremely likable 
and brightly cast as Dr. T's faithful daughter Connie.","Instead, it's a cheap opportunity to make him almost absurdly
sensitive and understanding, when understanding is so clearly what he
lacks.; Ultimately, Dr. T and the Women is a messy tangle of
estrogen and errant plotlines.; The women are constantly presented as babbling hens (none of Altman's 
overlapping dialog here - instead we get a maelstrom of cackle!); But with a really mediocre script he can waste talent on a
film worth only a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4
scale.; Fawcet is mostly left on 
the cutting-room floor, barely alive in any scene she is in - I know she is 
supposed to be disoriented but that is not enough for a robotic performance."
10774.0,Network,1989.0,"Yet the themes Network satires seem universal, some of the
problems of the seventies have taken shape in our modern time.; Duvall is even more ambitious and cynical than
Dunaway, and it is one of his most energetic
performances.; The direction is also very taunt and well
handled by Sidney Lumet, the great director who has never won a Best
Director Oscar.; While some of the many speeches by
the actors have more passion than spontaneity, they
are well written, and the various plot lines fit together
like a glove.; Holden gives the better
performance, and has a magnificent gravelly voice.","You can't fault personal taste
either: if a movie doesn't appeal to her, it just doesn't appeal.; Nothing written by Pauline Kael during her reign as America's
bitch supreme is more embarrassingly lacking of her usual perception and
foresight than her review of 1976's NETWORK entitled ""Hot Air,"" which can
be found in her collections ""When the Lights Go Down"" and ""For Keeps.""; The contemptible
phoniness and hate of God squads?; The
'Unknown Comic', 'Gene, Gene, the dancing machine' and that curly haired
host were all bad enough but 20 years ago who would have thought that
during a television talk show, fights would break out.; In addition to tabloid talk shows,
people have to contend with sitcoms that all look the same, recycled
from ideas of the past without a clue in proper execution or hint of
original thought."
10802.0,Showgirls,1999.0,"Available with an R rating or an NC-17 on VHS, this film comes 
highly recommended to those who are seeking an entertaining and 
provocative movie with an intense plot and great acting.; We have attractive, sympathetic, but still
highly repellent characters; we have shows for the eyes and the ears,
plotlines that play on several levels, we have beautifully delineated
characters who are drawn from life and very believable, and we have a
story of an innocent (who may not be so innocent) who's trying to play
straight, trying to improve her station in life, who slips into
behaving the way those around her do... but recovers with a flourish,
and quits a winner.; The relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the
movie, and provides part of the impetus Nomi needs to follow a
different path.; Kyle MacLachlan, whose single best previous work was as an
inhumanly emotionless cop in THE HIDDEN, gives us a nicely reptilian
bit of pond scum on two legs, camouflaged as a nice guy.; Showgirls explores the erotic world of stripping and show dancing 
through this beautifully done picture.","It is a total waste of time and money.; As bad as the first ninety minutes of this film are, the last
thirty are worse.; There is no story, script, point or acting.; far too annoying far too often.; Too bad it's one of the worst films of the year."
10803.0,Logan's Run,1999.0,"LOGAN'S RUN is often referred as the best example of a
science fiction movie that didn't age very well.; But it still remains very interesting and entertaining piece
of classic science fiction cinema.; Late Richard
Jordan, on the other hand, is excellent as Logan's
friend-turned-nemesis, bringing raw, masculine humanity to
his character, including some homoerotic overtones.; His
total opposite is equally superb Peter Ustinov who gives
dignified portrayal of half-senile, almost childlike Old
Man.; A
decade later, young rebels of 1960s grew older, world
economy was hit by fuel crisis, but hedonism was still
reigning supreme and the vision of the future in LOGAN'S RUN
was still very believable.","But, only a year later, STAR WARS would set much higher
standards and make LOGAN'S RUN look cheap and laughable.; The acting is, to put it mildly, bellow standards
you might expect in science fiction classics.; And Anderson as director uses that music on the wrong
scenes.; But the problems for LOGAN'S RUN aren't limited to the
obsolete visual effects.; Whether LOGAN'S RUN happens to be conservative reaction on
the excesses of 1960s and 1970s or not, might be debatable."
10808.0,Dr. Dolittle 2,2000.0,"This is a solidly entertaining comedy for everyone.; Each vocal performance is unique, and everyone is 
quite good.; Also noteworthy is the refreshing family 
subplot to the story.; This makes it a 
summer rarity, in that both adults and kids will like it.; He adds fun and flavor to each one of his projects, 
which certainly wouldn't be the same without him.","It is also painfully routine, more often boring than not, and 
instantly forgettable.; There's no follow-through on the animal mafia premise, for 
instance, and a subplot involving the emerging sexuality and 
independence of Dolittle's sixteen-year-old daughter (Raven-Symone) goes 
nowhere: a promised trip to Europe and a promising boyfriend (Lil' Zane) 
are dropped unceremoniously from the screen.; If 
anything, it could have saved millions of wasted dollars.; The various interactions between the doctor and the animals are predictable 
and too often tiresome.; ""Dr. Dolittle 2"" features a new director (Steve Carr) and the film's original
screenwriter (Larry Levin)."
10830.0,Matilda,1998.0,"In probably the funniest summer film this season, Mr
Wormwood and wife, (Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman)  aided by  Matilda
(Mara Wilson) make a most hilariously enjoyable movie for both
children and adults alike.; See the best film I have seen in 1996.; There's a
nicely bitter and twisted tone in her portrayal of the brutish
headmistress.; I loved the show from beginning to end.; This is a movie for both young and old, where the magic of imagination
is the central theme.","In MATILDA, Matilda Wormwood (Mara Wilson) is born to the worst
parents imaginable.; Someone must have told her once that acting means blinking a lot
and I, for one, felt sorry that they didn't cast the marsupial instead.; ""Matilda"" 
is fairy tale-ish enough to be unfrightening to youngsters and 
un-subverting to adults--unless the latter are as caricaturally stupid, 
uncultured, vulgar and insensitive as the crummy parents of charming 
Matilda.; The result is a movie
that quickly grows tiresome and, like too many other summer entries,
ends up a one-dimensional ride.; Mara Wilson, who lit up the screen as Robin Williams' daughter in
MRS. DOUBTFIRE, and captured the Natalie Wood role in the remake of A
MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET, is enchanting without being either sickeningly
adorable or unbearably irritating."
10833.0,Heartbreakers,1999.0,"CRITIQUE:
Despite its faults and ""video movie"" feel, I'd still slightly recommend this
movie because of its enjoyable premise, the two fun performances from Ray
Liotta and Gene Hackman, and the two other fun performances from Jennifer
Love Hewitt's breasts!; Very funny!; As it stands, though, it is very enjoyable watching Weaver.; As it stands, though, it is very enjoyable watching Weaver.; Isn't life wonderful?","Heartbreakers is a weak movie, one of wasted potential.; Heartbreakers is a weak movie, one of wasted potential.; The low point in the film has Weaver employing a Russian accent bad
enough to make Boris and Natasha wince, while doing half-assed slapstick
with a broken off penis from a statue.; Plus, Jack (Jason Lee), the guy she
falls in love with, is bland and rather dull.; Plus, Jack (Jason Lee), the guy she
falls in love with, is bland and rather dull."
10858.0,Nixon,1959.0,"At times it's a  touching drama of a man who had the world in
his hand and still wasn't happy.; This is not a film that reaches for easy and pat
answers, even if it does at times seem overly harsh on the man.; Still, the steps taken are entertaining and of high
quality.; Hopkins is not heavily made up -- and therefore doesn't really look like 
his character -- but his mannerisms are perfect and he is allowed a full 
range of facial expressions (unlike Robert Duvall in STALIN).; The great hope of the liberals destroyed before he could fulfill
his destiny.","Unwilling to abandon conspiracy theories, the director comes up 
with a rather ridiculous connection between Nixon and JFK's assassins.; He neither looks nor sounds much like Nixon, but worse
yet he exaggerates Nixon's slight slouch giving him a round-shouldered
hunched look.; Stone's script, annotated to support the
wormiest of claims made, won't pass muster with them, but watching their
father through Hopkins is likely to cause flashes of hurtful memories when
they hear this Nixon warn about ""the lie"" and ""the cover up.""; Through fuzzy-of-meaning flashbacks, which include scenes of Nixon's
parents Frank and Hannah, Stone tries to establish the origins of Nixon's
behavior, but as one watches, and notices what's missing -- like when at
seven he slammed a hatchet into the head of a six-year-old boy after he
refused to give Dick a jar of pollywogs; or Dick's disappointment in not
being able to attend Yale (that, had he attended, might have abated
instead of exacerbated his vengeful hate of the rich) -- it's apparent
that the director can't get to any root causes and linking manifestations
because he can't see where they are.; Unfortunately, this has become one of Stone's trademarks; he 
seems unable to make a film without making some kind of statement to the 
effect of:  ""Look at me!"
10862.0,Bounce,1999.0,"The
characters were believable and well played out.; The touching moments were
touching and the lighter moments light.; ""Bounce"" is a well-written, solidly acted love story with a great marketting
hook built in due to the curiosity factor about the casting of former(?); Let's face it, under 
these circumstances can this story really be told in a believable, realistic 
manner?; There is also a sense of things inserted as plot devices, and of parts 
of characters and situations that may have been jettisoned to keep the 
bounces a little more buoyant.20 Still, for most of its modest length ""Bounce"" lopes along with the 
smooth, easy ride of a polished genre picture.","In lesser hands, ""Bounce"" would be a romantic drama that is predictable and 
obvious every step of the way, offering nothing new in the way of plot 
developments or character motivation.; The actors would have served the audience better if they 
had heeded that advice.; I hate to say it, but up to now, save for some sequences, the film 
has been dull.; And though Gay Friend Seth (Johnny Galecki) was 
animated enough, the whole feel of the movie was flat, as if the 
actors were all only doing what they were doing because some lame 
director was yelling out lame
instructions at them.; In
fact, it's downright terrible."
10865.0,Atlantis: The Lost Empire,1997.0,"""Atlantis: The Lost Empire,"" the latest feature-length cartoon from
Disney, is an adventure story offering a smooth blend of traditional
drawing and computer animation, top-notch voice work from an impressive
cast and lots of action.; Any scenario where an alien culture is so well
thought-out with history and customs and language -- Atlantis present
the unique opportunity to create a similar vein as seen in previous
fantasy pieces.; The gradual romance between Milo 
and Kida is understated and charming, with both Michael J.; While far from
ideal, Atlantis is a good adventure film with at least some of the
nostalgic feel of classic exploration films.; than anything 
else, ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" is a worthwhile venture that may not go 
down as a modern animated classic, but it does expose Disney as a studio more 
than willing to break free of tradition and try something a little different, 
for once.","Atlantis is way too
complicated for kids and just too dull for adults.; The author of Hellboy has to be the person
responsible for filling a Disney cartoon with uncharacteristic violence,
superhero dialogue, sci-fi fantasy scenarios and scantily clad women with,
uh, positive attributes.; No singing teacups, wacky wort
hogs or talking apes, here.; Apparently, the animators were looking to place an
emphasis on story this time around, and they failed.; But this is one effort that lacks that fabled Disney magical touch."
10873.0,Shadow of the Vampire,1999.0,"It is witty, intelligent
and unusual ó a most gratifying experience.; Shadow is more delicious fun than classic horror.; Murnau was a fascinating man.; It also boasts what should be a lock for a Best
Supporting Actor nomination at next year's Academy Awards in Willem
Dafoe, who plays the spindly Schreck to eerie perfection.; His script is ready and he's
assembled a top-notch cast and crew willing to follow him on an eerie
location shoot in Eastern Europe.","You're supposed to 
wonder who's the bigger nut - the vampire pretending to be an actor playing 
the role of a vampire or the director for exploiting him.; But how successful can a film be with no A-list stars, a mediocre
actor-turned-producer (Nicolas Cage), a no-name director, a first-time
screenwriter, a miniscule running time (most of which seem to be burned
during the opening credits) and the presence of Udo Kier?; And then, if this weren't bizarre enough, he grabs a bat out of 
the air and feasts upon it.; The opening credits sequence is so long and
puzzling--it's not obvious what we're supposed to be looking at--that it
sets a bad tone for the rest of the picture.; The story, which was written by debut screenwriter Steven Katz (he
penned part one of HBO's From the Earth to the Moon), is unnecessarily
messy for a film this length."
10876.0,Quills,1994.0,"Winslet and Phoenix are effective as the essentially good
people aware of their darker impulses, but Wright is mostly interested in
them as representations of the dark impulses in all of us.; He has the most solid role in the film and makes the best of
it.; It's a shocking opening to a film that
proceeds to tell us about the man, Sade, who is compelled to tell his tales
in a way that both shocks and titillates the reader.; But, this is a minor complaint on a uniformly solid work.; As the Marquis tells the
tale of a noblewoman with a taste for pain, we see that woman responding to
the hands and kiss of her lover.","Simply stated, the film is a 
cheap novel itself with an insulting attempt at a moral stapled on at 
its end.; Rush has some power in the role, but even he falls short.; Rated R.  Running time: 120 minutes.; The film failed because it was too dull to be entertaining and it didn't
have anything startling to say about a startling subject to be
intellectual.; What I canít abide, though, are films that do it in such a
heavy-handed, obvious manner that it seems condescending to the
audience."
10877.0,Exit Wounds,1992.0,"Surprisingly competent despite its many
contrivances, this film is officially my first guilty pleasure of the year!; Still, you can't argue with a good car chase or helicopter 
bursting into flames, strong pacing, tight direction, and good 
old-fashioned action ... a lot of fun.; And to fully enjoy the audacity of Seagal, one must ignore all of the
consequences associated with the following: Starting fistfights with
large men in flashy nightclubs, destroying everything in sight along the
way.; Naaaah, this is 
definitely a ""shut the mind off and enjoy the action"" type of film.; But for me, I decided to take it as it came and I
honestly can't say that the film wasn't an enjoyable one, despite its many
faults.","What ""Exit Wounds"" ultimately never escapes is 
its low-rent, unpolished feel--a position that fails to give the film any 
credibility.; Exit Wounds is bad -- really, really bad.; And its just ""plain stupid"" scenes, like when DMX walks into a car
dealership, tosses the guy a bag full of cash and drives out with a car in
less than three minutes (no paperwork...nothing!).; Rated R. 
*  Starring Steven Seagal, DMX, Isaiah Washington, Michael Jai White, 
Anthony Anderson, Jill Hennessy, David Vadim, Tom Arnold.; The biggest shame of the film is the misuse of Seagal."
10878.0,Saving Silverman,1994.0,"It is
not a classic comedy, but it is an entertaining vehicle that will leave
you smiling.; The performances are topnotch and surprisingly, they are what keep the movie 
afloat.; Saving Silverman can be appreciated as
one sweet, long love song to the singer.; The trio, especially Darren, always have been unlucky in love.; Zahn (That Thing You Do and Happy Texas) and Black (High Fidelity) are
wonderfully funny, physical and bumbling as the inept pair endlessly
scheming to rescue sweet Darren.","Speaking of script, Hank Nelkan's choppy script is not only badly written, 
but not funny enough even for an episode of Sesame Street.; It has a great cast, a good 
director and a sweet story...it's just too bad it has a bad script and is all 
together a bad movie.; After all, any movie in which Neil Diamond is characterized as a
cultural icon who can save the day canít be bad.; Too bad that the rest of the film lacks their 
level of humor.; To be fair, there are two mildly diverting parts to the picture."
10881.0,Avalon,1999.0,"Levinson's
Baltimore films all have excellent dialogue which is at the same time
believable and surprisingly entertaining.; This is certainly one of the most moving and best
films this year.; The portrait of the family is at once realistic and
endearing.; This is not so much a story with a single conflict that is
resolved in the end, but more a chronicle told in episodes.; This is
     a film to be enjoyed more than once.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

10909.0,Kalifornia,1967.0,"As a result, the people are all human beings
and every situation is 100% believable.; It's a good film
with considerably more substance than most thrillers, yet it's not quite as
successful as it could have been.; Kalifornia is well acted, smartly written, expertly
directed, and definitely a film you need to see.; Brian's own fascination with violence, and his
forgiving attitudes towards those who engage in it, are both challenged by
the living example of Early Grace.; Those who don't
mind their movies sprinkled with moments of discomfort will find that
this picture packs a little more punch than a traditional Hollywood
slasher flick.","Still, the filmmakers might have gotten away with this kind of incomplete
resolution if they had played their cards right.; Unfortunately, they seem to be trying to fake it in the final reels.; At the
heart of KALIFORNIA is the question of whether some people are truly evil
or if everyone is more or less a product of circumstance, but the material
presented can't really answer that question.; The film takes the time to develop (with varying
degrees of success) all four characters, so that when the truth comes
out, events gain a resonance they wouldn't have with the lifeless stock
personalities inhabiting the average thriller.; Why not simply have
him drive up, park, and then confront Early?"
10912.0,All Quiet on the Western Front,1999.0,"It remains the greatest anti-war film
ever made, and it is one of best war films ever, much better
than more acclaimed films such as ""Apocalypse Now"" or
""Bridge on the River Kwai"".; ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was the first great film
of the sound era.; The film won Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director
(Lewis Milestone), and was nominated for Best Cinematography
and Best Writing.; The best scenes are the front line battles.; Lew Ayres stars as a common German soldier during World War I.","The horror and waste of trench warfare could not be better
demonstrated.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; Influences of the silent era can be seen in some scenes,
such as soldiers eating with exaggerated hand motions and
facial expressions."
10935.0,Heaven's Gate,1991.0,"It was great to 
see so many people turning out to see this wonderful film.; It is a great 
film and I thoroughly recommend that people check it out for themselves.; It sure makes for a hugely enjoyable scene.; It is both 
exhilarating and terrifying to watch.; His appearance is truly hilarious.","He really looks about 20 and I half suspected 
that these scenes *must* have been filmed years before the rest of 
the film where he looks considerably older.; I hope that other people will take any 
opportunity they get to see the full length version of this much maligned 
film which is no way deserving of its initial poor response.; This film has 
become synonymous with the idea of an overblown disaster.; For me, whenever I hear 
mention of this film I immediately think of the following:  massive flop,  
financial disaster, huge budget, Michael Cimino, a ruined career.; I feel that his character was poorly developed  by Michael Cimino."
10938.0,Beautiful Thing,1950.0,"Finally both Tony (""That's
cool!""); BEAUTIFUL THING uses numerous conventions of urban dramas and 
forbidden love stories in its framework, but, because Macdonald keeps 
the focus intimately on Jamie and Ste, the result is still satisfying.; For both it was their first film work.; It also came to
mind because of what is, in ""Beautiful Thing"", a major and perhaps
unintended bonus: the way this and many other U.K. movies seem totally
integrated in matters of race.; There is much in common between the older pictures and the newer, but also
differences, including the fact that working classes are often subjects of
comedies.","Editing, Don Fairservice.; Distributor: Sony Pictures Classics For better or for worse, most gay-themed motion pictures have a 
political ax to grind.; Despite having the potential to be BEAUTIFUL THING's most 
interesting character, she remains severely underdeveloped and 
underused.; Unfortunately, BEAUTIFUL THING has a plethora of subplots, none of 
which comes close to the main story in terms of richness or sensitivity.; Cast: GLen Berry (Jamie),
Linda Henry (Sandra,Jamie's mother),Scott Neal (Ste), Tameka Emson (Leah),
Ben Daniels (Tony), et al."
10946.0,Earth,1999.0,"Its powerful themes of religious
intolerance and senseless violence are still quite relevant today,
especially given recent events in central Europe.; ""Earth"" is not a
perfect film, but it is a great one, and it deserves to be seen, recognized,
and mulled over for years to come.; Rahman, India's foremost music composer, who writes a gorgeous
and searing score, all combining for a flawed but ultimately stunning film
that sears at the soul long after the film is over.; Its themes of true love,
chaos, and racial strife resonate as strongly today in 1999 as they do in
the movie setting of 50 years ago.; The other critical component for success is the superb
score by A.R.","On the minus side,
the deliberate plate-breaking scene seems a little precocious for an
8-year-old kid (to be metaphorically pondering separatist movements), and
maybe 10 minutes of extra scenery can be edited.; Another
character converts to Islam to save himself, and in one of the most
excruciating scenes in the film, is forced to show ""proof"" of his
religious identity by a mob baying for blood.; The
character's lives were reduced in scope and they seemed to be milked for
the benefit of making the story fit into the historical text.; It is impossible to review Earth without giving some background into
the events that precipitated one of the worst holocausts that mankind
has seen.; It just stops."
10972.0,Session 9,1999.0,"It's a fascinating comment and I agree.; Makes for an excellent haunted house story.; The year 1999 brought us the superb ghost story, M. Night
Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense,"" which meets its match this year with
Alejandro Amenabar's  terminally spooky ""The Others,"" starring
Nicole Kidman as a mother of two who becomes increasingly off
kilter as she witnesses invisible people opening and closing
doors in her large home while an equally unseen person
performs on the piano.; Everyone's always so perfectly paired, so I thought this was a chance to
break down some of the more obvious romantic comedy conventions.; Do you think shooting in
different cities lends a unique character to the movies you work on?","You do this thing in the movie which is kinda cool -- I guess you would
call it ""memory photos"" or something, done with stills -- Am I being pretentious to ask if that was inspired by Chris Marker's La
Jetee, or what?; Then it was trying to think what could be the most
absurd monkey-wrench that could screw it all up.; Filmmaker Brad Anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome
chainsaw-massacre-type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isn't
particularly scary.; Anderson opted, instead, to use
mature, experienced actors like Peter Mullan and David Caruso to fill his
characters' shoes and the difference in casting quality is notable.; The conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing."
10987.0,Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers,2000.0,"The preface is capped
   off with an atmospheric opening credits sequence encapsulating the
   backstory (and winningly homaging the late Donald Pleasance's
   character, Dr. Loomis -- whom, in my book, was the series' most
   intriguing) which conveys two unmistakable points: a) Laurie Strode
   has faked her death and gone into hiding, and b) homicidal boogeyman
   (and brother, natch) Michael Myers is coming to get her.; While The Shape makes his
   cross-country trek, the film establishes its new characters and
   revisits Laurie, who's changed her identity and moved to California,
   leading a low-key life as the headmistress of a posh boarding school.; Michael
made his debut in John Carpenter's 1978 horror classic, HALLOWEEN,
possibly the best scare movie to come along in the last twenty-five
years.; The John Carpenter original remains a
classic, scary, imaginative, low-budget independent film with a great, heroic
role by a very young Jamie Lee Curtis.; The stretch drive of the film, featuring Michael Myers making the
   rounds and finally facing off against sis Laurie in a fight to the
   finish, is what we've been waiting for the entire film, and well
   worth the wait, almost redeeming the preceding monotony.","The picture's interminable middle stretch is
   tedious, dreary material, punctuated by Mr.; --
Alex Fung (aw220@freenet.carleton.ca) | http://www.ncf.carleton.ca/~aw220/
""...a first screenplay unaccompanied by a powerful agent or industry
 sponsor is generally a pathetic fetus of a film, nothing more.""; The problem is that there's just not enough story to sustain this
   film; although its running time is already a thin 85 minutes, if one
   cuts the fat off this flick we could conceivably be looking at a
   short film.; That was an idea that promptly went nowhere.; That was an idea that promptly went nowhere."
10988.0,Diabolique,1998.0,"Pieces of DIABOLOQUE are
stylish and cool, even bordering on edge-of-your-seat suspense at times.; Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1955 murder 
mystery, DIABOLIQUE, was a taut, atmosphere-saturated thriller filled 
with unexpected twists and turns.; It starts to get a little hairy
when, after a seemingly perfect murder is pulled off, things start to seem
not-so-perfect and questions over potential witnesses and the actual
life-or-death-ness of Guy begin to surface.; The story is timeless.; There was one
part of the movie I totally loved and that was the overboard, but fun,
old fashioned dramatic movie music by Randy Edelman.","The kicker is the pasted-in
additions to the script, as writer Don Roos just couldn't leave the
original alone, adding in some long and uninteresting expository scenes,
some silly high-tech bits, and, the worst of all, a new, schlocky
horror-style ending.; Hey, if we have
to sit through this mess, lets at least have something exhilarating to
which to listen.; Jeremiah Chechik's ill-advised rip-
off is a lame Hollywood attempt to re-create a similarly suspenseful 
experience.; The script is a travesty and features dialog that is so trite as
to be silly.; I usually like Chazz Palminteri, although he has been bad in some
movies like MULHOLLAND FALLS, but here he is simply miscast."
10991.0,Pokémon 3: The Movie,1998.0,"The Unown 
bring together their psychic abilities and create Entei a powerful legendary 
Pokemon who barriers young Molly's house and creates every wish she wants.; Of course, there are numerous Pokémon battles, and you'll get to see your
favorite little critters, like Duckémon, Catémon, Squirrelémon, Batémon,
Rockémon and Bonémon.; My little 
brother just thought the movie was amazing, and I kept leaning over and 
asking him happened, or what Pokemon that was.; The best part of Pokémon 3 is
Ash's friend Brock, who doesn't open his eyes for the entire film.; They are small 
Pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities.","First of all it's a 
plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents, badly written script and 
fantastic animation.; It's
George-W.-Bush-is-our-President bad.; How bad is Pokémon 3?; This move has left critics wringing their
hands, as they have already used every possible creative way to say the
first two films sucked.; Warner has released their third movie based on the 
immensely popular video game and TV series and its a waste of time and 
celluloid."
10999.0,Commando,1999.0,"But his
final showdown with Schwarzenegger is quite impressive, anyway.; That also
includes the small army of brilliant character actors in the roles of
Arius and his henchmen.; But, he also finished the creation of his
on-screen Schwarzenegger personality, including his famous one-liners
and very specific, sometimes very cruel sense of humour.; The good
guys are under-represented (small roles of Bill Paxton and Chelsea
Fields are almost un-noticeable), but Rae Dawn Chong as Cindy,
displaying entertaining combination of ""damsel in distress"" and tough
chick that gives this movie brilliant comic relief.; And, sometimes, that fact
is enough to consider the movie good.","Thousands, perhaps even tens of
thousands of people in body bags or wheelchairs could be counted as a
indirect victims of movies inspired by RAMBO 2.; Schwarzenegger, who had already created an image of
invincible hero/killing machine in CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1981) and THE
TERMINATOR (1984) actually tried to give some new elements to his own
character (East German background as an attempt to give plausible
explanation for his accent).; Editing is sub-par in the final
showdown scenes, but only the most fanatical nitpickers would find such
fatal flaws.; That story
about lone U.S. Special Forces man that manages to single-handedly
destroy entire Vietnamese army was the product of Reagan years and
actually served as a substitute for U.S. victory in Vietnam War.; ""Ramboids"" weren't
just monstrosities in artistic sense - in case of former Yugoslavia they
actually proved the theory of movies as a bad influence on real life
people."
11001.0,Blue Streak,1967.0,"Whether it's
essential or not it certainly adds to the entertainment values involved in the
film and while some of the camerawork was flawed and a tad over-dramatic, in
some cases it worked.; ""Blue
Streak"" may not break any new ground, but I was
pleasantly surprised at how well the movie held
together.; He
especially liked the show's twists and the ending.; * * * * - Great flick.; Well-made, exciting action.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; Clearly aiming to be a funny 
comedy, the laughs are few and far between, and even then they cause nothing 
more than a brief giggle, only for the joke to be forgotten about five 
seconds later.; * * - Pretty bad.; All the other actors are unnecessarily wasted, and given very little to do.; Unfortunately, there are some rather large problems with this movie in addition
to the predictable script."
11005.0,Awakenings,1999.0,"It gives
the movie meaning and resonance for all of us with message of
appreciating life and having the courage to fight for it, a message not
that different from the carpe diem theme of DEAD POETS SOCIETY, Robin
Williams' second best movie to date.; This is a movie that I think will stay with one for a long time
because the story is so intriguing and the performances so strong.; It is a strange and haunting story,
excellently presented.; There are many wonderful performances in this movie.; The performances of Williams and DeNiro are extraordinary, Williams
for the subtleness, and DeNiro for the range.","The most unbelievable part of the movie was the mass drug-testing
of the entire catatonic ward.; They were hopelessly overworked once fifteen
neurologically-damaged yet awake people populated their ward.; These
scenes have the feel of Cocoon, and were out-of-place with the rest of
the movie.; Malcolm Sayer, a researcher in
neurology, has spent the last five years working with earthworms in a
project that failed.; Maybe that's the way it ""really""
happened, but the ward staff was incredibly stretched caring ""just"" for
catatonics."

performances from Gorney and Pescow.; It's not the most
brilliant film, but it's certainly one of the more intelligent dance
films.; One night, he sees a woman there (Donna Gorney), who is a great dancer

11033.0,Dressed to Kill,1997.0,"Personally, I think
that De Palma was also influenced by several realistic directors and by
Louis Bunuel.; In spite of the similarities in both films, ""Dressed to 
Kill"" easily stands on it's own as an exciting, suspenseful film and 
deserves a place in movie history as a classic just as much as ""Psycho"".; The simple
interpretation of feelings and thoughts is due to the crucial importance
of the sense of sight in our lives.; In my
opinion, a perfect harmony between the theme, aesthetics and
metaphysics along with excellent cinematography and acting turned into
a true masterpiece.; Although DRESSED TO KILL combines several styles, the film is
essentially realistic.","Going 
back to retrieve it, as the elevator door to the top floor opens, a tall 
blond woman with a shiny razor proceeds to slash Kate into mincemeat.; TO reveal any more would ruin the film.; On the second scene, the hooker explains the boy how to perform a
sex conversion.; A sexually active woman is brutally murdered.; ), don't sell ""Dressed to 
Kill"" short."
11044.0,Arizona Dream,1999.0,"I must admit to having
been particularly struck by Lilli Taylor who reminded me a lot of
Lauren Bacall.; The
drama proceeds along the theme of competition between Elaine and Grace
for Axel's affections (a la MRS ROBINSON).; COMMENTS:  The delight in the film arose for me, out of its spectacular
surreal and absurdist imagery, e.g., a fish flying down the main street
and the clever use of a balloon in transition from a dream sequence
into ""reality.""; Soon afterward he becomes amorously entangled
with a beautiful Elaine (Faye Dunaway), flying enthusiast, and her
daughter Grace (Lilli Taylor), accordion player and mining tycoon.; There are entertaining
quotations/excerpts from NORTH BY NORTHWEST, RAGING BULL, and THE
GODFATHER in the film.","There is a reference to the script of THE
WIZARD OF OZ in the credits which I must have missed during the film.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
11054.0,Hairspray,1984.0,"For those of you who have somehow missed the last ten years, or simply
never saw Hairspray,  its the simple story of the Turnblads versus the von
Tussles.; It's all a lot of fun, though, if not a little
unreal.; Longtime Waters fans will be treated to a double appearance
of Divine; in the normal housewife role; and most surprisingly, dressed as a
man, realistically depicting a 300-pound redneck TV station manager.; And look
out for Waters' own cameo appearance as a manic psychiatrist, wielding such
essential aids to modern medical diagnosis as the spinning disk, and the
cattle-prod!; Film director John Waters has always pioneered his own distinctive brand
of American ""cinema verite,"" but his latest work HAIRSPRAY marks a radical
departure from his earlier style.","It just
doesn't have the inventiveness of POLYESTER.; Directors often become boring or mawkish when they film
autobiographically.; With this latest
film, he is declaring his future direction to be unashamedly Hollywood-bound.; Shawn Thompson as Corny
Collins; Mink Stole as his sidekick Tammy.; It's because they wrongly assume that the audience will love the
subject as much as they do."
11062.0,City Hall,1997.0,"Al Pacino is excellent as always, 
but is relegated to the background of the movie to deliver key speeches 
from time to time.; The
ensemble cast is nearly flawless, especially Cusack as the go-for-it
right-hand man who has no life outside the Mayor's Office.; CITY HALL brings to mind hard-edged 1950s urban expose's like ON
THE WATERFRONT and THE EDGE OF THE CITY.; But fine performances from a charismatic Al Pacino as the
city Mayor, John Cussack as his inquisitive deputy, and a small side
role for Bridget Fonda the attorney.; This is real.","The biggest problem with this film is the screenplay.; It is not a good sign when there are four names on the screenplay,
but it may not be so bad if they are four good writers.; There's no
suspense at all, and you'll see the one measly plot twist coming a mile
away (not that it makes any sense, just that it's obvious).; As a result, the storyline is completely limp.; *  Four writers worked on the film, and that was obviously three
too many."
11065.0,O,1995.0,"Still, this is a bumpy ride.; The charismatic Phifer is a perfect match for the charming and
(over)confident Odin; his natural likability makes his simmering jealousy and
rage that much more upsetting.; It may not retain the Bard's
words, but _O_ works better than those films due to a fidelity of a different
kind: that to the spirit of original piece.; Of all of Shakespeare's tragedies, Othello is the most harrowing, not because
of any body count, but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by Iago, whose
motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery.; Mekhi Phifer struggles a bit during the more grandiose
parts of his meltdown, but is credible overall.","Having one lone black allows the screenwriter to throw in a bunch of
clichéd racial lines.; Josh Hartnett, sporting that godawful bed-head
hairdo he favored before ""Pearl Harbor,"" gives a performance consisting
almost solely of wincing and whining, while Julia Stiles seems overly
confined playing a character forced by the script to act illogically at
the worst times.; Rated R. Running time: 91
minutes.; They usually go
something like this: a screenwriter takes the
storyline from one of the Bard's plays, sticks it in a
modern setting, fills it with teenybobber stars, and
finds some way for it to be set in a high school.; Roderigo), a
bullied, insecure young man, to make it look like
Odin's girlfriend Desi (Desdemona; Julia Stiles) is
fooling around with Michael on the side."
11076.0,Fly Away Home,1995.0,"I loved the show and think you will too so I recommend it and
give it ***.; Jeff Daniels adds another off-beat role to his collection,  this
one more charming than some of his other recent ones.; Still, this is
one the adults will enjoy perhaps more than the children.; Still, Deschanel's ability to capture the birds in flight
together with the small ultra-light airplanes is extraordinary.; When we enter prime National 
Geographic territory, the flight of the humans and the 
birds is a gorgeous, fascinating succession of patterns, 
colors, landscapes and skyscapes.","Because of this, Anna's moping and whining for the first
half of the film seems to have little motivation and Anna's character
comes off as basically obnoxious.; So far the show is nothing more than your formulaic
despondent adolescent flick.; First, why do we have the
scene where the Uncle gives Amy a nose ring which she then wears for
the rest of the picture.; The first half of the film does include a nominal villain, a fish and
game warden (Jeremy Ratchford) who is made into a nastier character than
he needed to be when he threatens the geese with pinioning; the second
half tries to make up for the lack of conflict by including a handful of
potential heavies, including sport hunters, real estate developers, and
even the U. S. military.; For its first thirty minutes the movie is one of mood, 
eccentricities and lovely nature, but lacks focus and is not 
particularly involving."
11107.0,Eddie,1997.0,"(Hollywood)  
Starring:  Whoopi Goldberg, Frank Langella, Dennis Farina, Richard
Jenkins, John Salley, Malik Sealy, Rick Fox, Dwayne Schintzius.; The winner (surprise, surprise) is Eddie, who
becomes a fan favorite, and eventually the actual coach.; Bill is so impressed by her that, 
when he sees her at a game one night, he rigs an ""honorary coach"" 
contest so that she wins.; Cast: Whoopi Goldberg, Frank Langella, Dennis Farina, Richard Jenkins,

Music: Stanley Clarke
U.S.; It's about professional basketball,
so I'll release it right around the NBA finals to guarantee added
publicity.","It's a dull, stale affair with 
suspenseless game sequences, humorless jokes, and pathetic drama.; TWISTER, as inane as the script might have been, at
least required some creative technicians; MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, overwrought
plot and all, at least involved genuine effort.; Steve
Rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender
and screaming, ""Don't blame me, I just work here.""; It's difficult to decide whether EDDIE is so bad because it was so
shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can't even get the
cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right.; There's a bit of contrived 
melodrama at the end that tries to fake the audience into thinking that 
the result of the game might be in doubt, but we know better."
11139.0,Léolo,1992.0,"An amalgamation of oddball
and melodic pieces, it perfectly captures the feel of the movie.; Moments of bleak, and often shocking, reality occasionally intrude
on LEOLO's mainly-lighthearted tone.; LEOLO is essentially a comedy--albeit of a dark and unusual
sort--and the story is filled with humorous moments.; As a result, his reliance on dreams grows
from day to day.; To escape the
ugliness of his day-to-day existence, Leolo has fashioned a dream world
in which he can find temporary refuge.","Those who are
offended by such ""bathroom humor"" (literally), would do best to stay
away from this movie.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; Frequently, comedies with messages result in an awkward
end-product."
11157.0,She-Devil,1997.0,"On the performance side, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by
both Streep and Barr.; Streep is known as the
greatest dramatic actresses of our time; SHE-DEVIL gives her the chance to
show-off her knack for comedy.; SHE-DEVIL is a thoroughly enjoyable affair.; Seidelman's tour de force
direction is almost as memorable as the performances.; Barr shows a surprisingly natural screen
presence in her film debut.","It tries, performs
fairly well, but has fundamentally unsound material to work with.; The film is a very
pale, very weak, and almost entirely forgettable rendition of the same
story.; She is large, ugly,
heavy, sullen, and not outgoing at all.; Point number one is that the laughs were too few
and far between.; Her weight does not stand in the way of her
being basically attractive and charismatic."
11212.0,Baby's Day Out,1997.0,"Later, he makes
his way through a construction site in Rube Goldberg fashion, sitting
blissfully as tractors roll over him and sliding down girders onto
moving elevators.; Starring:  Joe Mantegna, Lara Flynn Boyle, Joe Pantoliano, Brian
Haley, Adam & Jacob Worton.; These are fun moments, made all the more appealing
by the adorable Wortons as Bink.; Brian Haley has a great
scene with a gorilla, while Joe Pantolianto plays Curly to Mantegna's
Moe.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","A subplot involving how a status-obsessed mother comes to grips with
her missing child is horribly misplaced, and these strains of melodrama
are cloying.; (John Wayne Bobbitt should probably
steer clear of this one.); Now, he has become redundant and tiresome.; Like someone unwilling to venture down an untrodden road, Hughes
has yet again come back to the worn-out HOME ALONE concept, this time
substituting a nine-month old toddler for wisecracking Macaulay
Culkin.; What is most annoying about films like BABY'S DAY OUT is that they
pretend to have an emotional message."
11215.0,Baby Boom,1990.0,"The pluses--some very funny moments, especially those centering on yuppie
cliches  (e.g.; J.C. learning about how important it is to get baby Elizabeth 
into the ""right"" pre-school), a nice conciousness of feminist values (which
includes some indication of men as nurturing parents as well) and some nice
scenery in Vermont.; The plot turns on J.C. finding a clever way to deal with her situation.; Then she inherits a baby from a
distant relative.; Ignoring the suspension of disbelief inherent in the way the
movie shows the adoption process, J.C. ends up trying to be super-Mom--and
still work 70 hours a week.","The minuses--the baby is just a little too sweet, the plot is a little too
pat, Diane Keaton is far too unbelievable in her ""successful businesswoman""
persona (unless you think that marketing executives stammer and giggle ""gee,
that's really great"" when a potential promotion is discussed) and nobody in the
cast had ever bothered to find out what a Vermont accent really sounds like.; There is also a romantic interest, J.C.'s live-in lover having walked out once
the baby came.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; 3 stars."
11229.0,Freeway,1999.0,"This movie is both grimly 
funny and thought-provoking.; FREEWAY contains several great moments, many of which work equally 
well as social commentary and comedy.; Grandma represents an ideal for the troubled girl, who has a
long juvenile arrest record and faces a bleak present, never mind her
bleak future.; This cynical view of human 
nature is what fuels the films of David Lynch and the Coen brothers, and 
it's very much in evidence here in Bright's directorial debut.; The result, 
or something very much like it, can be found in Matthew Bright's 
brilliant, incisive satire, FREEWAY, which updates the children's story 
""Little Red Riding Hood"" in new, surprising, and very adult ways.","Don't waste your time on this
turkey.; I wasted enough of my
time just sitting through it.; To top that pathetic
premise off -- Reese goes to visit Granny and you'll never guess who's
waiting under the cover's in Granny's bed.; So, she enters a
juvenile detention facility, accepting what happened to her without any
noticeable signs of depression, even laughing at the victim during her
absurd trial.; The film opens as Vanessa is in her special education class and
pathetically can't read the sentence on the board ""The cat drinks
milk."
11235.0,Local Hero,1998.0,"But more than being realistic in its 
characters and movements, it is extremely warm and entertaining as well,
providing the viewer with 110 minutes of pure cinematic pleasure.; The film's bittersweet ending, while 
certainly somewhat manipulative, nevertheless ""feels"" right in the film 
and, although it is certainly not a completely happy one, is definitely 
satisfying.; It
steadfastly refuses to conform to the conventions of the ""clashing
cultures"" genre (THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY, BEVERLY HILLS COP) and creates
a warmth all its own.; What he does is put together a mystical
menagerie of well-written characters who interact in logical, realistic 
ways.; The comic sense of the film is constant throughout the Scottish 
scenes.","I am referring to the introduction of Knox, 
the cantankerous aged beach resident who refuses to sell his land.; He 
simply seems too stereotypical of a role for this film which is 
otherwise filled with such eccentric types.; In a repeated gag, Mac is seen talking on the phone to 
an unknown character.; He insists on paying for his stay at the hotel, he shaves, he
dresses properly, and his businesslike manner almost conceals the
disappointment in his face.; The film seems to lag 
whenever he is onscreen."
11240.0,My Beautiful Laundrette,2000.0,"This is actually a fairly serious film with a wide variety of comic
touches salted in.; The film at once entertains and gives some insight into the
structure and politics of Pakistani families and into the problems they face.; One of the most controversial films of 1986 is an apparently minor film
that in this country is playing almost exclusively in art houses.; MY BEAUTIFUL
LAUNDERETTE was made for England's Channel 4.; Beyond those two the cast is unfamiliar but
good.","Also, the director,
Stephen Frears, has just released another film, PRICK UP YOUR EARS.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; So why the controversy over this film?"
11248.0,Fatherland,2000.0,"Rutger Hauer, who specializes of late in over-the-top
performances, is remarkably subtle this time as Major Xavier March.; With the war with Russia dragging on
forever, who could check the story's accuracy anyway.); In delicious bit of casting against type, Jean Marsh shows up
briefly as a creepy old German actress who blames her lack of success
in America on those Jews who run the studios.; The simple murder gets more complicated when General Globus (John
Shrapnel), the head of the Gestapo, is found to have been at the scene.; I read this engrossing tale on vacation a few
years back and thought at the time that a wonderful motion picture
could be made from it.","The book spent more time on the detective work whereas the movie
devotes too much time to establishing Hauer's ""good"" Nazi credentials.; A gripping and lucid book is thus transformed into a confusing and
slow movie that is populated with a remarkably tame group of Nazis with
little visible anger.; It is rated PG-13 for brief nudity, some
violence and a few pictures of concentration camp victims.; Even the Gestapo, with the exception of their
sinister hats, don't seem to be a particularly bad lot.; According to his
dossier, the dead man turns out to have been an architect of ""the
Jewish resettlement program"" and even designed certain new efficiencies
in the program."
11252.0,Psycho,1998.0,"With some terrific performances, great directing, and some 
suspenseful scenes, ""Psycho"" is a remake that even though not as good as the 
original, still an enjoyable tribute to the man himself.; The staging -- Hitch's ominous angles,
Bernard Herrmann's chilling score -- masterfully builds the tension, but
it also allows us watch Heche's mind work, and she's as fiercely
intelligent an actress as we have today.; Most critical is the
unique event that takes place when film and film-maker, actors and
audiences encounter each other in the viewing of the film.; The supporting cast is fleshed out with solid performances from
William H Macy in the Martin Balsam role as the private investigator,
Julianne Moore as Marion's sister, and Robert Forster (from Jackie
Brown, etc) as the psychiatrist.; At a deeper level, this movie is about the
traps we all find ourselves in, and the difficulty of escaping them.","A waste of celluloid.; As for me, I wanted a better reason to sit through a replica of the
original.; Van Sant has made a BORING film.; Director Gus Van Sant -- for reasons he has given anywhere from ""why not
remake a good film instead of a bad film?""; No, that would have been
silly."
11258.0,Hard Rain,,"A very well done scene.; If I had to pick the scene that puts sets the adrenalin pumping
fastest - I'd have to say it's  when Slater is locked in the jail cell
(heh, talk about ironic) and the flood waters start to rise... All in all this was an enjoyable movie that I see as an
oppurtunity lost to make a really break-thru movie much like Speed was
(man I wish they'd used the jet skis more often), but it is still a
very watchable movie.; All in all, a wonderful representation of a Popcorn Movie done
right, with an extra nod to the editors who managed to keep this puppy timed
to the perfect length of any ideal Popcorn Movie...90 minutes.; Minnie Driver, excellent in 
""Good Will Hunting,"" has a minor, but pleasing turn as a restoration 
expert who reluctantly gets drawn into the action, and Betty White makes 
an amusing cameo appearance as a feisty local who refuses to vacate her 
home.; (Dysart and White
provide excellent comic relief.)","Skip
this film, it's awful.; However, after this setup, the characterization goes nowhere.; It's
just that I cannot help but think that maybe the film would have been
better off being either a disaster film _or_ an action film instead of the
uneven blend that plays out onscreen.; Basically, HARD RAIN is one extended, dull chase sequence 
punctuated by occasional shoot-outs.; There is a problem, though--the disaster
looks good, but everything else in the film is bad."
11293.0,Paper Moon,1971.0,"Tatum O'Neal gives an excellent performance.; Set in the midwest during the Great Depression,
the era comes to life with black and white
cinematography, automobiles, radio shows and
popular music.; His
understated happiness and despair during good and bad
times is also appropriate to his character.; The acting of Ryan O'Neal has been criticized throughout
his career, but he is perfect in ""Paper Moon"".; Addie turns out to be an even
better con artist than Moses, and the two become
partners.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
11309.0,Hardware,1999.0,"The characters, usually a failing of
slasher-flicks, are well drawn and sympathetic.; But despite the world disaster, the
American society still exists, including the President and congress.; this character is evil, so they will die),
the robot is also never anthromorphised, staying expressionless,
precise, mechanical and all the more terrifying for it.; It is redeemed only because it makes
nearly every other horror film look good in comparison, and because it
reminds everyone who sees it of the dozens of excellent horror films
from which it labors so hard to steal.; HARDWARE is a recipe film, which is a little different than a
high-concept film.","Basically, there was no plot and I kept wondering where this was
going.; The first half of the movie is quite boring as
the movie does not go anywhere.; This week, the Phantom plans to do both, as the film to which he
was just subjected was so indescribably bad, so laughably awful, so
unrelentingly stupid, that neither immunization nor antidote alone will
suffice.; Uh oh.; If you want a violent movie,
there are better ones as this one did not contain that much."
11310.0,City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold,1998.0,"Jack Palance is
again a delightful presence, amd makes Duke a bit nastier yet also more
accessible than the crusty Curly.; For all that, it's still got more laughs
than any other comedy out right now, and a dose of high-spirited action
besides.; Overall, I'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous
adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than
the original.; The actors remain true to their
characters and play them well, without overplaying the jokes.; Once again, a serious theme is weighing on the conscience of
the characters.","Too many sequels are simply 
uninspired reworkings of the original material.; It was 1:56 long, but there was not enough
material here for even an hour and a half.; Dramatically, this film is an amalgamation of bad cliches.; Oh, 
there are laughs to be had here and there, but nothing memorable.; He indulges Billy
Crystal's worst tendencies toward hamming it up with Borscht belt
shtick, and Daniel Stern goes bug-eyed at the slightest provocation."
11332.0,8½ Women,1999.0,"The movie's nonchalant dismissal of
convention is refreshing.; In his brilliant feature debut ""The Falls,"" 92 biographies of the
survivors of a violent, unknown event are outlined with meticulous and
loving detail.; Leaving much of narrative to the printed page,
Greenaway believes that cinema is first, last and always for
the eye, with story lines taking a back seat.; There's no question that Greenaway is a superb
film stylist; he crafts powerful compositions like the interchanging
medium- and close-range shot of the father and son conversing by the
indoor pool, ripples reflecting off the walls.; Soon the balance of power in the harem has shifted.","A mediocre Greenaway film still stands head and shoulders above
your standard Hollywood fare, but as films of this talented filmmaker go,
""8 1/2 Women"" proves a huge disappointment.; Much of the film in fact seems digressive and
unnecessary, like a scene in which two servants discuss sexual deviance, or
a mildly amusing sequence in which Philip is refused entrance to his wife's
funeral because he has worn white, and has to switch clothes--in broad
daylight--with his black-clad retinue so that he can attend.; Greenaway's tactics are always
self-conscious, but here it serves no purpose.; Rated R.  Running Time: 120 minutes.; Don't mistake this, however,
for a film designed to arouse anything but curiosity."
11353.0,Bowfinger,1995.0,"Overall, Bowfinger is a must-see.; This movie is based on a very funny
premise, features plenty of laughs, great acting and a fun soundtrack.; Either way, Bowfinger
is a very funny and enjoyable experience.; and delightful as the 
innocent Jiff.; He plays both
roles superbly, with a sharp contrast.","Now, maybe
if Jiff was there from the start, Bowfinger could have worked better, but once
Jiff enters the picture, the screenplay, and film, becomes a total mess.; Since Sellers died in
1980, it looked as if they were trying to make a movie without having to
give any compensation to Sellers himself.; Heather Graham was a waste.; So, Bowfinger tries to get Ramsey by
trying to act ""ghetto"" and fails miserably.; However, he fails miserably."
11357.0,Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers,1998.0,"Perhaps I was just happy to see Michael Myers, one of
my favorite horror film characters, return after all those years.; -- Undoubtedly, the most important thing about Halloween 4 is its ending,
which is probably the most creative and suprising ending ever filmed for
the fourth film in a series.; I actually enjoyed Halloween 4.; Nice little details like these
make Halloween 4 more than the average underbudgeted slasher flick.; Halloween 4 has seen its share of criticism at the
hands of horror fans, but we feel that it deserves some credit for both
maintaining the feel of the original film and for covering new territory
with both new and old characters.","-- Unfortunately, the movie fizzles soon thereafter.; With the exception of Pleasence, most of the actors seem to have been cast
for their good looks as opposed to their acting skills.; If it weren't for the enormous body count, this would be a PG movie.; There's a pointless romance
subplot in which Rachel argues with the sherriff's daughter over a
pointless male character (who, as we all can predict, is destined to die
before the film ends anyway), and the sherriff leaves the house to reign in
a posse that has started taking pot shots at the local populace in the name
of hunting down Myers.; (Awww man, you mean Laurie
lived through all of that crap with Michael Myers only to die in a car
accident or something?)"
11365.0,Wilde,1999.0,"The film story of Oscar Wilde is beautifully brought to life  because
of its excellent cast.; Fry, also a writer and a wit, temperamental,
unpredictable, rather sweet, openly gay, is a rare case of perfect casting.; In that
respect, playwright/philosopher/world's most famous bisexual Oscar Wilde is
definitely one of history's most commendable presences, right up there with
Thomas More as people who stayed completely true to who they were, no
matter what the consequences...and of course, there were consequences.; And we see a wonderful, loving portrait of Oscar Wilde, who's
own time was not kind to him, but who's seen that history has seen him as
almost a martyr for true self identity.; This great play-write of
the late nineteenth century was undeniably one of the most charming men
to have graced the British Empire with his witty discourse and
intelligent writing.","After the first half hour, I found that the film up to that
point lacked focus and drive.; It becomes all the more
painful to watch since Wilde is a most likable fellow, generous to a fault,
and never really inflicting harm or hurt on others.; Director: Brian Gilbert
Writer: Julian Mitchell (based on the book by Richard Ellmann)
Starring: Stephen Fry, Jude Law, Michael Sheen, Jennifer Ehle, Tom
Wilkinson, Vanessa Redgrave, Gemma Jones, Judy Parfitt, Zoë Wanamaker, Ioan
Gruffudd, Matthew Mills I think that the greatness of a person can be judged in how much of a
bullshit artist they are, the least being more commendable.; Ironically, despite the languid pace of much 
of the film, the last 20 to 30 minutes have a rushed feel, almost as if 
the director realized he was running out of time and wanted to compress 
as much into the proceedings as he could.; Stephen Fry did a fine job of portraying the tormented writer, but his
talent seemed wasted on a character who never lived up to what the
real man really was."
11368.0,Blood Simple,1992.0,"Nevertheless, on the Granger
Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Blood Simple: Director's Cut"" still scores an
8, remaining an amazing, ironic debut thriller.; ), but the story is an ever-twisting bit of complex film noir.; Now
16 years later, the Coen brothers have decided to clean up their debut
film and re-release it to the masses, making it even better.; But when viewed as a real film, it's really an amazing
piece of storytelling, and one hell of a fun one at that.; But Dan
Hedaya's also very good, even though it doesn't seem like he's good at
first (he's usually hysterically tense), but upon closer examination, he's
great as a man who has held all his rage up inside, and can't control
himself when he boils over in fits of rage.","This isn't anything moody or intense, it's just plain dumb and
boring.; But no
matter; this film would be ruined with any of that kind of style.; Getz's forte is
playing pompous asswholes (in such anti-classics as ""Men at Work"" and
""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"" - yes, I've seen them); here he
seems just a bit weak.; There is some dialogue
pushing the story along, but it isn't very interesting because they're not
talking about anything relevant.; The Coens might have done well to title the film ""Fear and
Loathing in Texas."""
11374.0,Edtv,1992.0,"Still, it is an enjoyable two hours filled with solid performances and
some genuine laughs.; Landau is also wonderful as the stepfather Al, and Kirkland
does a good job by his side.; EDtv is very satisfying and
hilarious.; Either way, it is a
surprisingly touching, always funny film.; Matthew McConaughey gives a flawless performance as the American everyman.","But the
constant image of millions silently staring at flickering screens,
enraptured by the life of a tremendously boring insurance salesman, did
nothing but accent the annoying smugness of The Truman Show.; That is how bad EDtv is.; Matthew McConaughey is the worst actor in Hollywood, but he seems to have
finally found his niche in this movie.; True TV, a two-year old Bay Area cable channel owned by a Mr.Whitaker (Ron
Howard), is going downhill, badly.; If anything, it made the film even worse."
11377.0,House on Haunted Hill,1994.0,"Famke Jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times.; * * * * - Great flick.; * * * * - Great flick.; Geoffrey Rush gives a one in a million
performance as the rich Steven Price, and does a great job doing a Vincent
Price role.; Kattan's comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays 
the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; * - One of the worst movies ever.; To top off that
huge disappointment, every actor was wasted and the script was completely
ludicrous.; But the only thing frightening
about it is the waste of talent.; * * - Pretty bad."
11381.0,Tommy Boy,1993.0,"But for some reason, Farley and Spade
complement each other very well:  Farley does something really
stupid, and Spade makes an acerbic comment.; I did enjoy Farley and I especially like the scene
where he and Spade end up singing along to the Carpenters shmaltz classic
""Superstar.""; The two make an excellent team and if they can
find themselves a more substantial vehicle than this, a great comedy
might be born.; After graduating from seven years of college with a D+ average,
Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley) finds himself back in his hometown of
Sandusky, Ohio where a top job in his father's factory awaits him.; Whether singing along to ABBA, or beaming at the altar, she
radiates more charm than Andie MacDowell has ever known.","It's not that ""Tommy Boy"" is or isn't funny, it's just not a good film to
begin with.; After a while the slapstick and total stupidity become predictable
and repetitive.; Basically, any time the makers of TOMMY BOY try too hard to be
anything but funny, it doesn't work.; These films have primarily been wrong-headed attempts to
turn a five minute sketch into a ninety-minute movie (IT'S PAT,
CONEHEADS) or self-indulgent star vehicles for annoying stars
(OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS, BILLY MADISON).; This poor film doesn't
know what it wants to be, and so the narrative veers wildly in every
direction."
11382.0,Bullets Over Broadway,1996.0,"Jennifer Tilly, however, is
dead solid perfect as the simple-minded Olive, and Rob Reiner has a
wonderful bit part as a pretentious playwright who takes great pride in
the fact that ""both intellectuals and common people find (his plays)
completely impenetrable.""; It's a wonderful,
subtle performance worthy of Oscar consideration.; It's all cardboard, and it's very funny because
Allen telegraphs his obvious punches with great subtlety.; This turns into
some of the funniest scenes in the movie.; A great cast.","The girl can't
act, but she's no worse than the material--dialogue that a needs
doctor and needs one badly.; The acting is good, but other than Palminteri, nothing special.; It has some profanity, a little violence, and no sex or nudity.; The agent simply finds a gangster who, playing the devil
character, allows Shayne to sell his intellectual soul away.; Watching other people mess up can be excruciatingly funny."
11411.0,Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,1999.0,"I just got back from seeing the new SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE.; The movie did, however, have the usual moments of good humor, much like the
other movies.; Clark reveals his true powers briefly and by accident at some
good points.; He even had the classic superhero speeches such as his
""the subway is still a safe place for people.""; There were even parts of the plot I could say were pleasingly surprising
such as Superman's turning old and the coincidental retrieval (and even
existence) of Krypton's last power--the power module of Kent's spaceship (sure
was lucky he got it when he did, eh?).","Well, it takes guts to write a terrible script and
then to act it out.; The only feature that has any appeal in this thing is Margot Kidder
as Lois Lane; many of her scenes with Clark have some real charm.; Really, not a shred of interest, even to comics completists.; Most disappointing, though, is that Supes is played as something of an
assh*le.; What a joke!"
11443.0,Dead Presidents,1999.0,"Although DEAD PRESIDENTS isn't as intense or wrenching as the
Hughes Brothers' debut feature, MENACE II SOCIETY, the scope is
different.; The film is not perfect--certain sequences are awkward
or drawn from stock, and many of the supporting characters are
stereotypes--but solid storytelling and tight pacing push DEAD
PRESIDENTS through its weak spots.; ""Dead Presidents"" tells the story of Anthony (Lorenz Tate), a young man
growing up in Brooklyn in the late 60s, and is presented in three parts: a
coming of age section, a Vietnam and its impact section, and a big heist
section.; In detailing one man's actions and their
consequences, DEAD PRESIDENTS isn't just an African American tragedy --
its impact is universal.; The Vietnam section is very good, very authentic, but maybe a tad
nihilistic (what about that scene where that man steps on a land mine?)","It's just not going to be ""The Deer
Hunter.""; But the film seems too blatant
about making this point in its final scenes where a distraught Anthony
screams about how the government screwed him over.; Maybe an exclusion of
this shouting would have been more effective.; What motivation does she have for picking up two
revolvers and capping a cop?; And the film starts off well, but goes slightly down hill as it goes on."
11446.0,Welcome to the Dollhouse,1999.0,"But nevertheless, this is a fantastically executed film,
and a wonderful black comedy.; However, unlike most films that cause me
physical pain, WTTD is a good film.; The use of music, particularly Dawn's angry theme, is
excellent, and Solondz's little touches (like Dawn picking on Missy exactly
as the kids at school pick on her, continuing the cycle) make every scene
fresh and enthralling.; Story is only one facet of what makes this film great.; ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" is an amazing little film that was snubbed
for any Oscar nominations.","As written, this scene was pulled off in the worst way
possible because it suffered severely from clichi-itis.; Most scripts would have
coped out by compensated Dawn's mediocre looks with strong academic
strengths, but not this one.; He acts more like he was an adult than a teenager, even the
rock band he starts, is not a rebellious one, but he does it because it
will look good on his resume for college.; Everything was presented as is, there was not one
ounce of subtlety.; That's too bad."
11454.0,Manhunter,1997.0,"Also, this scene was
brilliantly filmed, as it was perfectly framed, showing in frightful
details the similarity and gulf between these two antagonists, as they
converse while in different cells.; Dante Spinotti's photography is beautifully effective
in making the urban and country landscapes fit so well into the
tenseness of the storytelling, while the widescreen is the perfect way
to see this original thriller.; This is an overlooked but superior horror film, one of the best films
from the 1980s.; This is an intelligent
psychological portrayal of both a serial killer and the FBI investigator
who dogs him.; There is a fascinating sequence concerning dusting a victim's eyes for
fingerprints and another in which the experts scan a handwritten note
from the killer, using infrared lasers to pick up details invisible to
the human eye.","There is none of the richness or depth that the book provides.; Respected British actor Brian Cox (Rushmore)
would not be so gauche as to flare his nostrils while smelling you --
he'd catch you off guard, throwing away the line about your cheap after
shave with ""a ship on the bottle"" with a bemused note of thinly veiled
contempt.; Manhunter
lacks catchy one-liners about eating someone's liver with fava beans and
a nice chianti (fh-fh-fh-fh), nor does it present cold blooded
psychopaths as pop culture icons befitting a t-shirt.; It is believed the killer is attracted to the moon and its
cycles, and plans his killings accordingly.; Other scenes with Graham and his wife, Molly (Kim
Greist), lack much thrust or purpose - the character of Molly is so
underdeveloped that we forget he is even married to her."
11465.0,Great Balls of Fire!,1999.0,"Ultimately, GREAT BALLS OF FIRE isn't especially memorable, but I
have to admit that the movie is fun while it lasts.; Thanks to Quaid's hyper-manic, physical
performance and strong stage presence, the concert scenes in GREAT BALLS OF
FIRE are exhilarating, even incendiary.; Fueled by his anger, Lewis takes the
stage and delivers a rousing performance of ""Great Balls.""; Lewis is in
top form; his passion and talent have not diminished over the years while
the technology of recording music has improved dramatically.; One touch that is unusual is Lewis's conflict
with his famous evangelist cousin, Jimmy Swaggart.","Consequently, the movie's few attempts at drama fail
miserably; they have neither credibility nor impact.; The characters are flat and thin, and the
relationship to truth or even credibility is tangential at best.; The movie is paper thin, altogether lacking complexity.; Quaid supposedly wanted to
sing all the songs but apparently while he can flip his hair like Lewis, he
cannot do a passable imitation of Lewis's voice.; But really jarring are the segues into musical production numbers, such
as a whole high school suddenly dancing to his music and doing cartwheels
(what is a 13-year-old doing in high school?)."
11467.0,America's Sweethearts,1999.0,"I was surprised by how good the performances were and how well-timed in terms of
comic pacing.; Billy Crystal moves things along (and gives himself some of the funniest
lines, especially when acting opposite a large Doberman), both as writer
and performer and he does good PR shtick.; Alan Arkin
gives a subtle, yet riotous, cameo as Eddie's wellness guide.; Easier said than done, considering Eddie has spent the last 18
months at The Wellness Center with a Bowfinger-like Svengali (a hilarious
Alan Arkin).; It's warm and cute as well as satirical and sharp.","Julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make My Best
Friend's Wedding into a winning film, but not even that 90-tooth smile
can save her here.; Such a good cast, such a
waste of their efforts.; ""America's Sweethearts"" is a dull-witted, utterly slight comedy 
that, dare I say, is boring from one end to the other.; The payoff, which
comes when we finally get to see the mystery movie, is
a complete failure, a decent idea that the filmmakers
ruined, making it far less incisive than they
apparently think it is.; Susan Granger's review of ""AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS"" (Columbia/Sony) What a waste of a talented cast!"
11475.0,Leningrad Cowboys Go America,1998.0,"And the shoes are excellent: just the right
touch.; Trust me, LENINGRAD COWBOYS is a lot of fun ... a road movie with
music and Jim Jarmusch (MYSTERY TRAIN, A NIGHT ON EARTH) in a used car
lot.; You can watch it and then amaze your friends with your subtle cool
taste and international erudition.; A really
good film like this one will remove all the inhibitions associated with
self-entertainment.; The band goes from Russia to New York, New Orleans, Texas and
finally Mexico where the accordions and all that come in handy again.","Is this some kind of joke?; That's ok, though, because these guys are masters of every genre
of music, dress like freaks (fur coats, unicorn-like hair and really
pointy shoes) and let nothing stand in their way as they travel across
America to a gig at a Mexican wedding.; These are the same kind of people who made Stephen Spielberg
a millionaire and think Jim Carrey is the next Jerry Lewis (whatever
the fuck that means).; He forces
the band to subsist on crumbs while he sucks down the brews.; Did I mention that they've carted
their dead bass player all the way from Finland, packed in ice?"
11489.0,Rosetta,1998.0,"They have created a masterfully perfect visceral film, that is
unflinching in its realism and unsentimental in its study of her.; Rosetta, played with the emotive power of a stone by Emilie Dequenne,
lives a hardscrabble life in a Belgium trailer park with her alcoholic
mother (Anne Yernaux).; I will lead a normal life, you will lead a normal life.; This is a film made for purists of
the cinema, those who don't want to see another disposable film, but who
wish to see a film that is unmistakably direct, a film that they can see
themselves in if they are not too calloused and frightened of life to
look at the dark side.; Despite her horrid circumstances,
the film chronicles her incredible perseverance and strength as she
attempts to get a job that will provide food and rent money for her
desolate family to survive.","ROSETTA, on the other hand, was so dull
and convoluted that the hand held style fails miserably in its attempt
to create a `realistic atmosphere.'; If you
thought the hand held camera motion from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was
bad, you'll be stumbling out of this one with a splitting headache and
nausea that only Dramamine can prevent or projectile vomiting can cure.; The story is so devoid of tension that you sit there hoping against hope
that some horrible tragedy will befall Rosetta so that the story will
finally get in gear.; (In order to pass the time, one can reflect on how
this movie has managed to show up on best and worst of the year lists
from major critics.; These crucial blunders,
coupled with the poor handheld photography, spoil Emilie Dequenne's
performance, which resonates as the only bright spot of the whole film."
11497.0,All Dogs Go to Heaven,1986.0,"Carface is an old, gross
bulldog who smokes cigars and keeps young Anne-Marie hostage in his
basement.; The other, amazingly enough, is just the opposite, and the film depicts
almost all of the dogs as representing a vast criminal underclass of
society.; When Charlie tries to con
Anne-Marie, he tells her, ""What a hopeless cad I've been.; Charlie manages to get back from
heaven, but when he comes back, he has not learned any lessons and is
up to his old tricks stealing wallets and other nefarious activities.; As the film starts, two dogs, Charlie (Burt Reynolds) and Itchy
(Dom DeLuise), are crooks ""on death row"", a.k.a.","The songs written by T. J. Kuenster and Charles Strouse are as bland as
bland can be, but the singing by Charlie is even worse.; The main reason was
that it is boring and holds no interest whatsoever, other than the
character of the only human lead, Anne-Marie.; It is so bad
that is hard to call it singing.; Charlie is boring with a capital
B, and the voice is his least attractive attribute.; Oh well, this
was not the main reason I did not like the show."
11498.0,Dead Again,1999.0,"But what
makes her think she is being stalked is one of the essential pieces of
information Church must deal with.; Surprisingly, he does so, and gives one of his best performances I
have seen him give.; Dead Again is a
masterful piece of filmmaking with impressive sets, great acting, and
some of the best direction of a film of this genre.; DEAD AGAIN is a stylishly executed thriller that doesn't take
itself too seriously.; No
other director that I know of has starred in his own films, given
credible performances, and at the same time, created a masterful work.","At the hands of a lesser director, nothing would have made
sense.; Most of the praise should go to the director, but without the actors,
there is no director.; With this
cast it should have been better.; Is someone actually trying to kill
her?; A nameless, voiceless woman (played by Thompson) shows up at a church
school."
11517.0,Money Train,2000.0,"Matthau and Lemon.; At the New York Transit Museum, a abandoned subway station in
Brooklyn that vividly shows the history of one of the finest and
largest public transportation systems in the world, a movie theater is
lined with photos of classic straphanger-oriented films from the past.; It's a good movie, action-packed with just enough sass, humour,
energy and seriousness to keep it interesting throughout.; It is that relationship that gives the film a real boost.; Their apprehending of criminals in the subway trains and
at subway stations is what keeps whatever safety there is.","MONEY TRAIN is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.; ), this film might (and I mean *might*) have
turned out okay, but as it is, it is stocked with the worst action film
cliches, whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its
painfully long running time.; What exactly
is this mess?; It tries to make us swallow
things that a better movie would be stopped cold by or just plain omit
entirely.; If you look at
the script as if it was an action film, it lacks originality and
suspense."
11520.0,Grumpy Old Men,2000.0,"Fortunately, drama always plays second fiddle to comedy, and this
is a very funny motion picture--surely one of the most consistently
amusing of the year.; Lemmon and Matthau are perfect for their roles as lifelong
sparring partners, and while the development of John and Max as
individuals is lacking, their relationship is brought into sharp
focus.; GRUMPY OLD MEN, on the other hand, is such a film, and while it won't
come close to my top 10 best list for 1993, it will be right up there
among the pictures that I had the most fun watching.; Actually we get to see that Lemmon and Matthau really do have a
chemistry together still as we see them joking with each other in the
outtakes run under the final credits.; For one thing,
it's simply a pleasure to see Lemmon and Matthau together again.","It was done with due thought and deliberation
because they wanted to show that these men were basically incapable of
doing anything other than fish or fight.; But what was worse than being proven right was that apparently the
film was not simply meant to be funny, but was deliberately and
calculatingly meant to be derogatory and insulting to the title group.; The very idea of ""masculinists"" is ridiculous.; The
fault is not his and is certainly not his actors' but that of a poorly
written screenplay by Mark Steven Johnson.; Guess I'm just getting
old and grumpy."
11522.0,Pretty in Pink,1999.0,"PRETTY IN PINK is one of three teen comedies of the 
mid-80's from John Hughes starring Molly Ringwold.; So the movie rings true, even if Andrew McCarthy has never asked 
me out.; I've always been liked by mainstream society even if our main 
interests and convictions in life clash horribly, preventing the 
friendship from moving beyond the acquaintance level.; PRETTY IN PINK is a mixture of both, giving us 
non-conformist characters Andie (Ringwold), Duckie (Jon Cryer) 
and Annie Potts, along with the dilemma of a mainstream character 
(Andrew McCarthy) who wants Ringwold as a girlfriend even though 
his ""richie"" friends won't approve.; And if you're Molly Ringwold, you'd better get used to the 
fact that you'll never work again in Hollywood and just hope the 
residual checks from Saturday afternoon airings of movies you did ten 
years ago keep coming in.","Why would you even think twice 
about such a thing?; Ultimately, this movie is the same typr of predictable psuedo-
drama Hughes gave us in THE BREAKFAST CLUB, only this time the 
lines between characterizations are drawn more tightly.; And if you're the type who is independent of society and find 
out an attractive and popular member of the opposite sex wants to go 
out with you, for God's sake, say yes.; Otherwise known as THE J. EDGAR HOOVER STORY... 
sorry, couldn't resist.; Let's start the review over..."
11525.0,Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace,1998.0,"My lawnmower man is personable, friendly and always punctual.; The
war waged between Jobe and mankind has become a personal vendetta for
vengeance.; This boy befriended
Jobe as a child, and has since grown into a young man surviving in the
crime riddled streets of the future.; He creates Jobe
(Matt Frewer), a supremely intelligent monster who not only survives
battle within virtual reality, but has the gall to demand a rematch.; When I hear the burrrrr of the motor I know I'm
running late for work.","The poor direction and badly written plot results in a lack
of genuine excitement or interest.; So mankind survives to fight another day, but perhaps the next
time round a hose carrying fireman or a greasy looking construction
worker will amuse us instead of this overworked simpleton gardener.; Needless to say the performances by the actors are wooden, or should I
say plastic.; Peter (Austin O'brien) is the only member of the
original cast to appear in the sequel besides Jobe.; The result is the
oversimplification of how to get rid of the bad guy - we'll just cut him
in half!"
11526.0,Bandits,1995.0,"Together
they make the perfect man - strong, sensitive, intelligent and capable -
and Kate refuses to choose between them.; She also falls first for
Joe, then Terry, deciding that together, they make the perfect man.; He puts a solid spin on his Terry,
creating a nerdy, smart felon who, though a rampant hypochondriac, is able
to survive life day by day.; All in all, I had a rip roarin' good time and liked the story
about these amiable crooks.; Terry, the smart one, comes up with a plan that is brilliant in its
simplicity.","The movie fails the laugh test miserably.; Although they
are supposedly the most successful bank robbers in the history of the United
States, these two irritating characters appear to be smart guys acting dumb, or
perhaps it's the other way around.; The rest of the cast is there to fill the void around the stars
and not much more.; She joins Cameron Diaz (""My Best Friend's Wedding"") and Candice Bergen 
(""Starting Over"") in the hilariously awful screen singing club with her 
rendition of ""Walk on By.""; Thornton, channeling Woody Allen at his worst, plays the story's central
character."
11543.0,Kingpin,1976.0,"**** Amazing, potent stuff.; And sometimes very funny.; The acting is top
notch, especially from Angel and Murray, and the really funny scenes are
worth noting.; After listening to an astonishingly lavish and fawning review by both
Siskel and Ebert (""I can't wait to take my friends to see it, ""easily the
funniest movie of the year,"" ""laughed out loud all the way through,"" etc.); The thing about KINGPIN is that even when it is obvious, sick and/or
repetitious, it is still often very funny.","This movie is a complete and utter waste of time.; A waste of talented actors.; Unfortunately, it just didn't do anything funny.; Cheap.; And the really disgusting thing about this movie isn't
the crude jokes themselves, but how grossly unfunny they all are."
11548.0,*batteries not included,1995.0,"Ebert was in a good
mood, and recommended it for the special effects and the cute models.; The sweet pregnant thing upstairs,
abandoned by her musician boyfriend, is scared for the health of her baby, so
she won't go to a doctor.; Cronyn has it tough.; Siskel and Ebert split on *BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED.; All
the needy people stay unhappy, hopeless, and forgotten, for the most part.","In the case of *BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED, however, I want to be
the first to warn everyone: Stay Away From This Movie.; Siskel
thought it just didn't work.; Since the ads show it as part of the
title, I will presume that the makers of the film intended it to be that way
and include it here.; If you think cute, mute flying robots are worth 90
minutes of pointless pathos, this is a film for you.; To
this end, he alternately bribes the residents of the building with envelopes of
cash, and threatens them with attacks by the local Hispanic gang, whose leader
is basically good but just Never Had a Dad (Big Brothers of America, where are
you?)."
11551.0,Small Soldiers,1992.0,"One of the funniest sequences is an homage to real life.; If Toy Story told the story of what would happen if everyone's favorite
childhood toy came to life, then Small Soldiers tells the story of what
would happen if today's violent action figures sprung to life.; ""Small Soldiers"" is light fun and frequently funny, though not at the same breath as ""Gremlins.""; It was the
greatest movie I ever saw in my life.""; It's a fun film which isn't action packed as much as it is
introductory in its presentation of multiple play things similar to the
many characters seen in 1995's 'Toy Story', although 'Toy Story' is far
superior to this film.","But despite the good performances, the film suffers from weak directing, a
poor script, and dull set pieces.; Instead of an
un-subtle attempt at really trying to overturn cartoon violence and its
affect on youth (which would have made for an annoying right-wing
crapfest), ""Small Soldiers"" decides to use that as a way of mocking
patriotism and basically the whole military as a concept.; It just doesn't help that the Gargonites aren't really that interesting
either, save for a couple of moments when the rest of them are finally
allowed to do their schtick.; It's just stupid violent.; Featuring the voice of Tommy Lee Jones Once again good intentions are ruined by bad executions."
11566.0,Dave,1988.0,"DAVE isn't just a good movie; it's an
excellent one.; Kevin Kline shows a marvelous
sense of comic timing and delivery, Sigourney Weaver does a good job
playing her role straight, Frank Langella is perfectly over-the-top as
the ""frothing at the mouth"" villain, and Ving Rhames delivers a deadpan
performance as a no-nonsense Secret Service Agent.; While not startingly original, DAVE is fun and well-made.; And along the way Ross has given us a lot of very
funny gags, a story that offers surprises and few holes, and lots and
lots of laughs.; And one more nice touch: Kline's rendition of
the song ""Tomorrow"" from ""Annie"" is the first time I could ever make out all
the words.","He was also responsible for last years
profitable-but-moronic animal film BEETHOVEN.; Certainly somebody photographed as often as the President of the United
States is could not long be replaced by an imposter.; In this dual role he has to look like two different men who just happen
to have identical features.; Two of his aides (Frank Langella and Kevin Dunn), unwilling to give up
the power they have amassed during Mitchell's term, persuade Dave to
stay on and continue his masquerade for an undetermined period of
time.; Likeability overcomes
originality."
11568.0,Blues Brothers 2000,1997.0,"The Blues Brothers was a wonderful film, a hilarious comedy packed with
good music.; Ultimately, Blues Brothers 2000, while nothing like the first film, is
a car-crashing, toe-tapping classic that is a wonderful follow-up and a
unique, hilarious, and outrageously wonderful cult classic.; It's fun, and the music is
great.; BLUES BROTHERS 2000 isn't anywhere close to 
the landmark its predecessor was, but it's still enjoyable.; It's blues music.","These were
superfluous and a waste of money.; Musicals, when done poorly, come across as dull
and contrived, as if there's no reason to have the music at all.; Maybe I should have rented the original film before
subjecting myself to this; at least then I would not have been
blindsided by the pure, toxic awfulness of this movie.; This isn't an awful movie by any means, it
just lacks that cheeky sparkle of John Belushi.; It lacks any 
original ideas."
11592.0,Serial Mom,1996.0,"Overall, enjoyable, trashy fun.; The mom is played perfectly by
Kathleen Turner in one of the best performances of her career.; Sure, its got enough gore to satisfy any horror fan, but it
also has a nice satiric edge to it, one that will make anyone with a dark
sense of humor laugh.; She lives in the perfect world of the upper middle class
suburb; she oversees the perfect family.; Waters does exactly what he sets
out to do, and Turner delivers a terrific performance.","Too bad.; Plastic America is a tired cliche.; While the idea sounds fertile, the
execution is uneven, and the laugh-provoking comedy sporadic at best.; I'm talking laughed like Robert DeNiro in Cape Fear during
Very Bad Things dark.; Too little time and effort is spent
setting her up as a representation of the middle-class ideal, and the
early parodies of suburbia (a ripe enough target) are poorly-realized,
not to mention lacking in originality."
11593.0,Nobody's Fool,1997.0,"Nobody's Fool is an excellent character piece that starts great and just
keeps getting better.; A hilarious subplot involves Sully's determination to get what's coming to 
him, compensation for his knee injury.; Behind Sully's surface 
simplicity lies a complex man.; Sully, happy-go-lucky, occasionally hard-drinking, 
always ready with a wisecrack or repartee, is liked by all who 
know him: by the judge (Philip Bosco) who rules against his 
lawsuits and later sends him to jail for assailing a vexatious 
cop; by his ineffectual lawyer (stage director Gene Saks) who 
has an artificial leg; by Miss Beryl; by his friend, handyman 
Rub (Pruitt Taylor Vince) who is his partner-employee in odd 
construction jobs;  by the bar-lady of his regular haunt; by 
the police-chief... Sully may be perpetually broke, but he is, as the old yet 
valid cliche goes, rich in friends, and quietly willing to 
help others and treat them decently.; Paul Newman and Jessica Tandy give excellent
performances but there is a very strong supporting cast with very good
ensemble.","Nothing is prettified, and winter (the 
time is between Thanksgiving and Christmas) makes things even 
worse with dirty snow and lack of cheerful greenery that would 
hide ugliness.; I use the word ""ducked"" because he is finaly trying to make amends for
his past failing as a parent.; As Sully's sidekick, Rub Squeers (Pruitt 
Taylor Vince) is a poor man suffering from ingrown dreams (""You know what I 
wisht, Sully?""; Like the near-total absence of touchy-feely 
scenes.; They often seem more like actors reading straight
from the book and not feature films."
11597.0,Toys,1998.0,"Joan Cusack, on the other hand, delivers a wonderful performance as
Leslie's sister Alsatia.; There are so many unique scenes in this movie that I think it is
well worth seeing, despite its obvious flaws.; One aspect of the movie that most people are bound to miss is the
excellent soundtrack.; Individual kudos go to Joan Cusack and LL Cool J.  Cusack sparkles
as the gentle little-girl space cadet.; Joan Cusack played his sister and Robin Wright played the woman
he gets interested in.","TOYS was a disappointment.; Robin Wright as the love interest is
supposed to be a female version of Williams, but she fails to convince.; Visuals cannot rescue a movie with
neither acting nor a plot.; This movie is being marketed as a comedy, but
for nearly twenty excruciating minutes, there's absolutely nothing funny
about it.; It starts with a lot of promise for an
obvious formula, but quickly becomes very dumb, culminating in a final
scene reminiscent of the classic SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS."
11644.0,Blow Out,1997.0,"All in all, BLOW OUT is an effective thriller which, although not essential 
viewing, is well worth a look if you get the chance.; John Lithgow turns in a gripping performance as the assassin ,which is very 
effective and chilling.; I thought it was
limited in scope but because of the flashy camerawork, the fine
performances by both Travolta (his first major starring role) and
Lithgow, and the many thrills it provided, it was easy to watch and just
as easy to put out of my mind.; It had received mixed reviews from the
major film critics at the time, but the film, even though it was an
uneven one, has caught the attention of some current film critics and
film buffs, and is now established as a cult-favorite.; Brian De Palma's ""Blow Out,"" however, 
is one of the few films I've seen that is a triumph of both style and 
substance.","It
unsuccessfully tries to work a conspiracy theory into the mystery.; He is currently working with Sam (Boyden), knocking off as
many as 5 cheap films a year.; His films are pretty
to look at and are good at simulating what an art film is, but they are
more interested in being entertaining than anything else.; This film will prove itself in the end to be without
sufficient weight to be put in the heavyweight class.; There is also 
a subplot involving the post-production work of the B-movie they are 
making."
11645.0,Ran,1997.0,"The film
is beautifully shot, and the color scheme in this film is brilliant.; The film is beautifully well made, with subtle changes in color and
texture as the story progresses.; Visually, the design is incredible.; At 2 hours and 40 minutes the film is a bit on the long side for most
people but it does not deter from the fact that Ran is an incredible
picture worth seeing and talking about.; I think this film is more of an 'expose' of the downfall of the feudal
lord system in Japanese society ( specially seen today with their economy
coming down to reality ... the rise of the middle, and fighting, and working
class ) than it is based on the story of King Lear, although the sequence of
'fillers' in between the action is decidedly Shakespeare flavored.","The reason we should be motivated to
sit through all 160 minutes without a break should not be because every
hour and 10 minutes, there's a really nifty battle scene.; A film is never more
boring when it's filled with shallow characters taking the easy way out of
very dilemna they're charged with.; It says a lot for the copycats, doesn't it.???; For example, the movie A Fistful of Dollars was really nothing
more than Western remake of the Kurosawa film Yojimbo, and The
Magnificent Seven was a remake of The Seven Samurai.; Must sees include
THE SEVEN SAMURAI, THRONE OF BLOOD ( based on Macbeth ), YOJIMBO, DREAMS,
KAGEMUSHA,  and so many other films,... he is the scourge of Japanese
producers, who wish  to make billions ( not millions ) while this director
just wants to make  critically acclaimed work based on his vision."
11667.0,Street Fighter,1993.0,"The fighting in the movie, a staple of de Souza films, is
energetic and very believable.; Capcom's video game, which revitalized a sagging coin-op video game market
and created a trend for many other games to follow, had a few firsts: it
featured a diverse and intriguing cast of characters to choose from, and it
also featured a number of strong and visually arresting female characters
(Chun Li and Cammy), who did more than hang around and wait to get saved.; The creepiest aspect is Raul Julia's portrayal as M. Bison.; His character still graces the screen as a
powerhouse in sheer strength and fighting skill, and Julia carries the
film with his acting.; In fact, someone I know who's is really into fighting
games also said he thought it was good, which I take as a qualification
that de Souza did his job in bringing the game to the big screen.","The military details are *laughable*,
and, unfortunately, unintentionally so.; While
this can be attributed to the sinister lair of M. Bison, other times
it appears to be just poor cinematography.; They were trying to make at least an enjoyably lousy movie, but they
haven't even managed to do that.; The former champion does his magic
making average actors look like black belts.; Alas, STREET FIGHTER is still a lousy movie,
period."
11673.0,Cyrano de Bergerac,1993.0,"With
Depardieu at his very finest, you will not want to miss it.; Cyranno is a good film.; It is
beautifully shot, and the camera-work is top-notch.; The talent is the mix of
well  known poetry, and lines, with a setting that is excellent, and an
atmosphere
that is really  beautiful and well lit.; More astonishing is that
each has been just about excellent.","That would have been
far worse.; Either Cyranno is too shy, or this girl just is too
naive, and not a good companion for him, who is so intellectually
stimulated.; But this film depends heavily on language, and subtitling
is just not adequate.; Despite being filmed as a movie, no liberties were taken with the
dialogue from the play, as far as I could tell, although at least a few
scenes were trimmed.; In
particular, the sub-titles are the bane of this movie."
11675.0,Halloween H20: 20 Years Later,1997.0,"The movie is well directed by Steve Miner who does a great job with some of 
his death scenes while putting plenty of suspense in them as well.; His camera 
shots are chilling, and he puts John Carpenter's classic score in the movie 
very well, and once scene at the end put chills down my back, I realized this 
time Laurie is hunting down Michael, instead of vice versa.; To 
round out the cast there is more good performances from Jodi Lynn O'Keefe and 
Adam Arkin of the Chicago Hope fame.; Jamie Lee Curtis makes a sensational return to the horror genre, and brings 
her character Laurie Strode back to life.; When I heard they were going to make another Halloween film 
with Jamie Lee Curtis I almost peeed in my pants because I was so happy, and 
I must say I was quite impressed on how good this film was being the seventh 
movie in a long running series.","There are some intriguing issues bubbling just below the
blood-spattered surface of ``H20,'' which brings Jamie Lee Curtis of
the original two ``Halloween'' movies to restore some much-needed
class to the slasher-flick genre, but the film's 85-minute running
time leaves scores of irritating unanswered questions and unresolved
issues.; It's also way too short, and there is too many jump 
scenes.; Rated R: horror violence, gore, language.; There's considerably more attention paid to
characterization here than one would expect in a horror film, and that
may cause ``H20'' to seem slightly sluggish to fans raised on the
high-energy, hip wit of the ``Scream'' movies.; Josh 
Hartnett plays her son and although he is good in the part, you can really 
tell he is acting."
11779.0,Buena Vista Social Club,1999.0,"Their genuine camaraderie
for each other and love of country and gentleness, shines through as
much as all the wonderful music they play.; In its heyday, all of the best bands played at the ""Buena Vista Social
Club"" in Havana.; Mixing clever storytelling techniques - like a series of nifty ""steadicam"" 
shots that encircle the musicians - with implicit awe for these special 
styles of music, ""Buena Vista Social Club"" stands out as a non-fiction film.; Wim Wenders (The End of Violence, Paris, Texas, Lisbon Story) made the
very touching documentary Buena Vista Social Club in collaboration with
guitarist Ry Cooder, who had found the aging musicians in Cuba, in 1996,
musicians neglected after Castro came to power.; Box Office Magazine may have pushed the envelope a bit
when its critic, Wade Major, called this ""One of the most
beautiful and poetic documentaries ever made.""","I know that this review is very short, but there
isn't much that I can say about the film, because there really aren't any basic
plotlines.; It's
an obvious failure, as even these great musicians were not recognized by
the Cuban government; it took an outsider to do it.; Only ones with adequate legroom will do.; Ibrahim Ferrer is the mellifluous sounding 70-year-old singer, who was
shining shoes all these years before being part of Cooder's tremendous
coup.; He didn't even own a piano before
the film was made."
11790.0,Peter's Friends,1999.0,"It is certainly better than many of the
comedies coming out of Hollywood these days.; This is a good film, especially if you like films with real
characters.; Needless to say that this film is excellent, and
the acting is above and beyond the call of any one's duty, and that it is a
very enjoyable evening, the likes of which many of us would love to have
once in a while ( well, we can forget the news.!; But the film is
excellent, and very enjoyable, and allows a theatrical play to live, without
having to resort to filmdom's very famous close ups.; The finest
ensemble style acting that you will find, is in both of these productions.","The sentimental scenes are boring and it would have
been better off without some of them.; The most boring one is Kenneth Branagh.; Peter's surprise is pretty evident by the time he
and Andrew collect firewood; and it appears that during the writing,
Branagh and Rudner were so hung up on their own characters (I guess
obnoxious characters beset by personal problems are supposedly more
complicated than genial characters beset by personal problems) that the
married couple are given precious little to do, and Laurie looks really
out of place and uncomfortable with his screen role.; I was really disappointed, and felt that the actors were wasted
in their roles.; *  I find it interesting that scenes of social embarrassment make me
    want to crawl underneath my theater seat; but Ahnold turning a camp
    of [fill in your generic force of nasties here] doesn't even slow
    my hand for popcorn."
11797.0,Fright Night,1996.0,"One of the best vampire flicks in ages, ""Fright Night"" is grand
entertainment - rollicking good fun with an expert cast and a daintily
enjoyable script.; Sarandon and McDowall are perfectly
cast - rising above all the horror with splendid, memorable performances.; He is not like any
traditional vampire, but he has charm, elegance, and is believably frightening
at times.; This film along with the
cult classic ""The Return of the Living Dead,"" ""Critters,"" among others showed
how much fun filmmakers could have with the genre.; ""Fright Night"" becomes over-the-top towards the end and repetitious, but it is
a consistent balance of fright and fun.","Ragsdale would have been a fitting replacement
in the ""Psycho"" remake.; The camaraderie between Charlie, Amy, Evil Ed, and the older, wiser Peter
Vincent is at the heart of ""Fright Night"" - without them, the film would be a
futile exercise in gruesome special-effects.; Charlie's giggling, posturing, Jack Nicholson-like friend, Evil Ed
(Stephen Geoffreys) is no help either.; He sees Jerry luring prostitutes and call-girls to his house, even
undressing them and biting their necks!; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
11800.0,Naked in New York,1998.0,"Perhaps this show can
be seen by young people today as an incredibly brilliant protest
against the meaninglessness of this lives.; His relationship with
Joanne is on shaky ground, as their respective careers begin to eat up
the time they once devoted to each other.; So, leaving Joanne behind to pursue her new job with boss
Elliott Price (Timothy Dalton), Jake heads for the city.; Then Jake's friend Chris
(Ralph Macchio) calls from New York to say that powerful producer Carl
Fisher (Tony Curtis) wants to produce Jake's play MASTER OF MY
EMOTIONS.; Whoopi
Goldberg plays a concrete face in a wall, and really, that's the best way I
can describe it.","There is absolutely nothing to recommend you ever waste your time
watching even a minute of this.; I
detected nothing any of these people did worth any money.; The
film is rated correctly rated R, but again, I would give it a big B for
boredom.; CAVEAT: I confess to being a baby boomer.; I loved Jill Clayburgh in AN UNMARRIED
WOMAN, but she was so pitifully bad in this movie it made me feel very
sorry for her."
11808.0,U.S. Marshals,1991.0,"Marshals is brainy fun, and visually spectacular.; All the stuff you love from your
traditional action/suspense/mystery flicks, but with better characters
(especially Jones' Oscar-winning Gerard role) and better action
set-pieces, pushing it into the above-average fun-film range.; Marshals is a very well-made thriller.; I especially loved Sheridan's daring escape from the top of
the nursing home.; Director Stuart Baird, who did an excellent job with his debut film,
Executive Decision, can't help but have his work be overshadowed by the
strong sense of deja vu that permeates this film.","What a waste of talent.; US Marshals is disappointing, but not in the material, in the editing.; Skip this one unless you're a Jones fan, and even then, wait for video.; No matter how bad that sounds , i do not want you to get the impression
that this is a bad movie , far from it.; No matter how bad that sounds , i do not want you to get the impression

11822.0,Nekromantik,,"To reach the height of fantastic delight, Rob decides to murder himself 
while reaching orgasm!; Rob brings a cute cat home with him to surprise Betty with as a gift, 
only to discover she has left him.; Therefore, a list seems more appropriate, and here are just some of the 
things you view in this lovely piece of ""art.""; Finally, we see Rob's grave, freshly buried.; - Copyright 1999 by Dustin Putman

rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","There doesn't appear to be any 
rhyme-or-reason behind director Jorg Buttregeit's extremely low-budget 
production, aside from to be shocking.; There's 
nothing I could have watched, however, that could possibly have prepared me 
for the German film, ""Nekromantik,"" which is just about the most repugnant, 
vile piece of garbage to pass itself off as a kosher feature-length motion 
picture that I'm sure has ever been made.; Everything from high-class 
brash to low-rent trash, to the unimaginably gory and disgusting.; ""Nekromantic"" is so vacant 
of ideas, and cohesive storytelling techniques and characters, that to write 
a review in the normal way wouldn't be doing justice to the film at hand.; ""Nekromantik"" is a sickening 
excursion into the twisted life of a necrophiliac, but the treatment of the 
subject is both severely exploitative and offensive, and there is absolutely 
no talent involved in any of it."
11849.0,Dungeons & Dragons,1985.0,"My son Jeffrey, age 11, and some of his classmates who saw the film with 
him really liked it.; Send to: johnbeachem@dependentfilms.net Past reviews can be found at:
http://us.imdb.com/ReviewsBy?John+Beachem * * * * * - One of the best movies of the year.; As I mentioned, I was never a D&D player, but I do know that navigation
through booby-trapped mazes and dungeons is a big part of the game (one
of the more exciting elements, from what I remember from friends who
played back in junior high).; Join Juno today!; And this is on top of boasting two traditionally excellent actors in 
Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch.","is painfully bad as the bald, lipstick wearing, and not even 
remotely intimidating Damodar.; Otherwise, about the only thing ""Dungeons & Dragons"" has going for it is 
that it at least falls into the category of films so bad they're funny.; Amongst a legion of bad actors, Payne 
stands out as the worst.; Alas, his 
script is ridden with cliches and the dialogue comes off unintentionally 
silly.; Of course, she only has about ten minutes of 
screen time, and in a movie filled with really horrible dialogue, she gets 
the worst."
11850.0,Invasion of the Body Snatchers,1994.0,"Petty criticisms aside, ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" is
a good and original film that successfully explores the
paranoia that sometimes lurks within us all.; http://members.tripod.com/~Brian_Koller/movies.html The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Often they
act quite human.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","However, 
the melodramatic score, heavy-handed direction and hammy acting 
make it more of a comedy than it was intended to be.; It can be argued that tampering with
the director's concept ruins the film, but a three minute
scene added to an eighty minute film cannot significantly
affect its grade.; This begs the
questions: Why does a sci-fi flick have to have a love interest
subplot?; Taken
one by one, they just seem to be bad tempered.; While the plot has these people's bodies possessed by
alien pods from outer space, the screenplay may be a thinly
disguised jab at cold war paranoia in the U.S., and the general 
belief that communists were around every corner and out to 
subvert the country."
11853.0,Bad Girls,1996.0,"Still, it did leave me wishing, among other things I've missed
in life, that I might just once have strapped a holster to my hips and
leapt onto a flying horse to escape my enemies.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the

Feel free to reuse as long as source acknowledged.; In the manner of old
flames, Cody knows right where to find him when she wants her money
back, which makes the journey seem like a quick trip to the cleaners.; I mean, how much realism can
you expect?","BAD GIRLS is a good idea that is doomed by a terrible script.; They're
just misunderstood, but I suppose the title MISUNDERSTOOD GIRLS lacks
panache.; Unfortunately,
BAD GIRLS isn't supposed to be a comedy, and most of the most amusing
sequences are intended to be serious.; All-in-all, BAD GIRLS would have been much better if the zealots
had hung Cody at the outset, then gunned down her three friends as they
tried to rescue her.; Ready
for a romp, they sink in embarrassment."
11855.0,Pecker,1999.0,"Most of the
other performances are highly energetic:  Place and Joy create
wonderfully cloying parents; Plimpton is likable as a
homosexually-obsessed woman; Taylor is perfectly pitched for satire; and
young Hulsey is dead-on as the ADD child.; It is an enjoyable movie if you are an aficionado of Waters' films.; The ensemble cast all deliver solid performances
and bring to life Waters' wonderfully colourful gallery of eccentric
characters.; John Waters may be an acquired taste but his ""Serial Mom""
(1994) with Kathleen Turner still ranks as one of the funniest films
I've seen.; Not one of John Waters's best, but still very enjoyable.","Just not funny.; I am more astonished by
how putrid the writing and directing are in ""Pecker"" - it has no redeeming
value whatsoever.; PECKER starts out promising, and it is a warm-hearted movie, I
suppose, but ultimately Waters goes through his standard
motions-suburbia as sideshow.; And this is part of why the movie fails.; The problem is it's just not very funny."
11858.0,Renaissance Man,1999.0,"But DeVito's a lovable lout and he carries
the film.; From Danny DeVito and
Gregory Hines on down, everyone turns in a fine performance.; Danny DeVito stars as Bill Rago, a Detroit advertising executive
whose creative cold streak and chaotic personal life land him on the
unemployment line.; Starring:  Danny DeVito, Gregory Hines, Kadeem Hardison, Mark Wahlberg,
           Stacey Dash, Khalil Kain, Lillo Brancato, James Remar.; There are *some* rewards, such as the curious sight of
DeVito rappelling from a training tower.","Only without any of the flavor.; RENAISSANCE MAN is a glossy mess that, like its young protagonists,
just can't shoot straight.; RENAISSANCE MAN is a movie of moments, too many of which are
mediocre or unfulfilling.; Unfortunately, RENAISSANCE MAN is far from the director's best effort.; There are at least three too many Double D's, each
requiring a personal epiphany of varying magnitude, and Penny Marshall
has to spread the film far too thin to accomodate them."
11860.0,Sabrina,1925.0,"SABRINA is a surprisingly delightful and fresh romance.; In SABRINA she is brilliant.; Sabrina goes to 
cooking school where the teacher-chef is very funny, while Marcel Dalio 
plays an elderly student, a delightful nobleman who sophisticates 
Sabrina.; Just the way she walks and carries herself
says so much about both stages of her character.; Although the movie is perhaps not great
art and it does have flaws, I strongly recommend everyone see Ormond's
performance and catch the rest of this show as well.","The new film lacks the wit, class and pacing of the original.; The 
sequences are way too long, disconnected and cliched.; The Ormond hype of reviewers 
(e.g.; Bad news for 
Mother Larrabee (Nancy Marchand, awfully gowned and photographed like a 
gargoyle) and Linus.; I was looking for logic instead, and found none."
11862.0,Father of the Bride Part II,1993.0,"A brilliant performance.; FATHER OF THE BRIDE II is a surprisingly excellent and
touching comedy.; Shot by 
cinematographer William Fraker with warm, golden tones, it's a 
celebration of suburbia as the ultimate culmination of the ""American 
Dream.""; And Steve Martin isn't 
just a great comedian, he's also a great actor whose equally terrific 
in comic, heartwarming and dramatic scenes (see last years virtually 
unnoticed A Simple Twist of Fate).; He
tells Nina, ""together we're almost a hundred!""","Skip, however the 1995 pregnancy
movie ""Nine Months"" (with Hugh Grant), which is pretty poor, except for
Robin Wiliams's turn.; What's even worse is that the film is so lethargic that a
sleeping-pills incident stands as a symbol of the whole.; Martin Short again plays Franck Egglehoffer,
but in the sequel he is not so obnoxious.; Trite lines like ""Thanks for 
marrying me, Nina"" and ""Life isn't gonna get much better than this"" 
pepper the screenplay.; Wong (reprising their roles from part one), whose 
exaggerated accents and mannerisms go far beyond being irritating -- and 
scenes with these two are supposed to be comic highlights...  To add 
insult to injury, Eugene Levy is on hand as a caricature of a greedy 
Arab who's almost as offensive as Short's Franck Eggelhoffer."
11867.0,Barb Wire,1998.0,"If you are farmiliar with the '42
classic you will enjoy this film more than the regular viewer.; For you who will want to see it, you will want to know the info about
the REAL reason to see this film.; The big surprise is everyone's favourite silicon based
lifeform, Pamela Anderson.; Yes, like the Mona Lisa, Pamela Anderson is a 
man-made beauty, probably in more senses than one.; They need a way across the border into 
Canada, and think Barb may be able to help.","(""The worst movie of the year,"" I say.); Unfortunately, other 
than a couple of very obvious, absurdly over-the-top scenes, this film 
is just plain boring.; The film makers undoubtedly recognized that they were making a bad 
film.; Her delivery of the 
requisite quips is awful, and her signature line (""Don't call me babe!""); The movie is set in the year 2017, ""the worst year of my 
life,"" Pam says."
11879.0,Near Dark,1998.0,"""Near Dark"" may not be as accomplished on a techinical level as 
something like ""Blue Steel"", but it certainly displays Bigelows flair
for visceral thrills.; Also, as with ""Blue Steel"" and ""Strange Days"", ""Near Dark"" features very
strong female characters.; ""Near Dark"" is a fun movie.; She makes them likeable.; FRIGHT NIGHT,
VAMP, INNOCENT BLOOD) revitalized the myth by using urban American
settings and putting a quirky spin on their stories.","Of course, none of this would matter if the film wasn't any good.; Beyond that, NEAR DARK is over
three hours in a film so bad, every minute of watching it counts as two
minutes off your sentence.; There are no wielded crucifixes, bats, wooden stakes, bloodstained
fangs--in fact, the word ""vampire"" isn't even mentioned--we are just
expected from our knowledge of popular folklore to assume they are so.; The
scenes of the bullying are long and violent and bloody and boring.; If this sounds like THE LOST BOYS,
also released in 1987, then you'll probably realize why NEAR DARK
became a victim of bad timing and lost attention at the box office."
11896.0,Throw Momma from the Train,2000.0,"Tres entertaining, tres engrossing.; Beautiful
music (best thing John Williams has done, and I *love* his SUPERMAN and COWBOYS
-type music).; arguments that the net had about THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN,
but I saw it with great trepidation and was surprised to find myself really
enjoying it.; The critics have loved it.; Everyone else is up to snuff (if not exceptional) and
the script is fine.","The concept could have made for a successful comedy, but virtually
nothing in this comedy is funny.; This thing is about two-and-a-half
hours long, and there is just not enough meat on the plot to feed one of those
starving prisoners-of-war the film features.; And, of course, the three main
characters (Hurt, Brooks and Hunter) take the entire film to even delineate; I
gave up trying to second-guess anyone in this movie after the first fifteen 
minutes.; The characters are
inconsistent and unbelievable.; The scriptwriter seems to think
that a writer finds a first line and then builds a story around it--not too
surprising, since he seems to have built a film around a funny title he
never successfully fits into the plot."
11925.0,Naked,1998.0,"Excellent theatre, if you will.; But that's
precisely why it works -- it is not only honest and unsparing, but true and
properly observed.; A very talky film, with excellent rushes, nevertheless it leaves many of us
feeling unfulfilled.; The fact is that in his own unique way,
Johnny is a true optimist.; For writer/director Leigh, NAKED marks a shift from
the skewed and wildly imaginative themes of his earlier work to one
that contains a deeper and darker undercurrent as he renders a
provocative and moving vision of contemporary England.","No screenwriter could have come up with the
material in NAKED; it's just too confrontational and too raw.; It
is boring, if one likes action.; Tak Summary
-----------
     This movie doesn't have much of a ""plot"" in that the characters
are out to save the world, solve a mystery, or avoid a slasher.; The Sebastian
character is way too much, too crudely drawn to work as the
representation of gilded brutishness he is meant to be.; The
Andrea Dworkin side of me was screaming, ""this is wrong of this
film-maker to show this brutality against women ... especially since a
*man* made this film and he doesn't know how disturbing it is for a
woman to watch this shit!"""
11932.0,Bride of Chucky,1999.0,"""It's great fun.""; Another element I liked in the film is the realistic love-hate 
relationship between Chucky and Tiffany.; ""I'm 26 and I liked it.""; For being a third sequel in a reputable slasher series, it is amazing 
some of the talent they were able to get.; Her cleavage also makes an excellent showing,
and I'm not afraid to say this, almost brought me to tears in one
particular scene.","But the laughable dialogue and lack of plot isn't as problematic as the
uninteresting and unlikable characters.; In addition to
being anti-Catholic, the film is also terribly misogynist, with female
lead, a Valek-bitten prostitute named Katrina (Sheryl Lee, reduced to
screaming and trembling), constantly getting slapped around and humiliated
by Jack's boorish partner Tony Montoya (Daniel Baldwin, who, quite simply,
sucks--bad pun intended).; The most disheartening thing about _Vampires_, however, is not its
campiness, but its lack of scares; it's hard to believe the same man who
made the elegantly creepy (and largely bloodless) classic _Halloween_
directed this piece of schlock.; Throw in some silly casualties and a ridiculous ending (will 
""Son of Chucky"" be next?); Similarly shaky, the acting ranges from screeching camp to 
boring bland, the effects aren't that special and the story is one big 
groaner."
11950.0,Cannonball Run II,1999.0,"It will be well 
worth it!; This movie has to be one of the funniest movies of the 80's and sadly 
overlooked.; It is often relegated as a second-rate Burt, but this movie 
packs so many cameos and awesome stunts by director Hal Needham that it 
achieves a surrealism that almost makes it a commentary on pop-art 
culture.; The stunts are 
spectacular and the laughs fast and furious.; Cameos range from 
Jackie Chan to Frank Sinatra as the President.","Let's me describe the plot  What do you get when you mix a 
pair of bogus nuns, inept undeworld warfare, and a bunch of crazies 
willing to risk their necks in a all-out cross country race?; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
11953.0,Kagemusha,2000.0,"It is a well thought out story, and well carried out, throughout,
deserving a much wider audience than it has gotten.; With beautiful sound effect's work, excellent footage of battle scenes, and
a knack for dramaturgy, this film maker stands out as a real master,
specially seen as such when two of his best friends George Lucas and Francis
Ford Coppola produced this film, and distributed it around the world, much
to the chagrin of the Japanese film makers whose attitude towards money
making is as fierce as the shogun's thirst for blood.; His work is impeccable, and
really should be seen and appreciated, in as wide a screen as possible.; It is visually
glorious, as is the trademark of this film maker, and has some very
impressive shot configuration, which I have only seen in the films of David
Lean.; There are very few artists, and people, who refuse to compromise on their
beauty, and AKIRA KUROSAWA is one of them.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; And then the
story centers around his actions till the end of the film.; The only problem is that the replacement has moments of self doubt and pity,
and they are shown in staged sets, with props, thus suggesting the idea that
his problems are illusory."
11959.0,UHF,1999.0,"I highly recommend this movie.; This is a good movie.; The beginning is very funny, with his parody of
Indy Jones, and of course one of the best moments had to be a song.; While UHF is not an absolute must-see, it's definitely the ticket
if you're looking for a wild and zany, whacked-out comedy.; But the funniest bits in UHF are so hysterical that we can
forgive the ones that fail; we know another gut wrencher is on the way.","For instance, Weird Al's mock video of
""Money For Nothing"" by Dire Straits is only mildly amusing and brings the
film to a grinding halt (although it does have some nifty computer
animation).; I
fantasize that one day I'll be sitting at my computer, tapping away on the
keyboard, mumbling to myself, when suddenly I'll be snatched out of my chair by
two meaty hands and lifted up until my feet are dangling in the air (which is
even more frightening than it sounds, considering I'm six-foot-four), with my
nose pressed into the face of some pre-hominid who has a face like a Rottweiler
with a complexion problem.; The plot is cliched and holey; the bad
guys might as well be made of cardboard, and after the opening scene, the next
20-30 minutes fall dreadfully flat.; And everyone went
berserk over a line which most others will think mildly amusing : ""Congrats:
You just won a drink from the firehose.""; She was pretty
unconvincing."
11962.0,Joe's Apartment,1997.0,"are delightful.; JOE'S
APARTMENT works best as a mild comedy about life in the Big Apple.; And talent, belting out
a variety of ""roach songs"" throughout the film, from rap to gospel to Busby
Berkeley-inspired production numbers, each one sillier and cornier than the
last.; JOE'S APARTMENT is based on an original short subject that aired on MTV in
1992.; As I said, I like the way the film develops in the early stages, 
taking some chances and daring to be a little different.","The idea of an 
apartment inhabited by talking cockroaches has potential but never 
goes anywhere because the writing is lame and the plot so stale and 
transparent, not to mention the fact that the Joe character is just 
plain annoying.; There's not enough story here for something half 
that length, so we're subjected to numerous pointless and irritating 
song-and-dance numbers designed to nudge the lame plot towards its 
conclusion.; JOE'S APARTMENT is ridiculously bad, unfunny beyond 
belief.; None of it is any good and the only 
times the movie elevates itself past awful and up to the level of 
pretty bad are when the cockroaches do their three song-and-
dance numbers.; The plot, involving a
romantic interest and some serious landlord woes, is awfully thin and
makes the 79-minute running time seem longer than it really is."
11966.0,Short Circuit 2,1937.0,"If you think
that a dozen or so laughs are worth the price of an admission ticket, be my
guest.; My recommendation, however, is to wait to rent it or see it on
cable.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","It would be hypocritical of me to say that SHORT CIRCUIT 2 is a big
come-down from SHORT CIRCUIT since, frankly, I was not much of a fan of the
first film.; One is Number Five itself, now mysteriously called by Everyone Johnny Five;
the other (I am sorry to report to all Asian Indians) is Ben, the
malapropping Indian robotics specialist who is now a toy manufacturer.; What it was
like was any of dozens of throw-away summer films.; But Number
Five is reduced to being just a cute character made out of electronics
parts.; Rate it a flat 0 on the -4 to +4 scale--for the sake of those dozen
reasonable gags."
11971.0,Much Ado About Nothing,1999.0,"And in
between, are many other well cast people, that make this play so enjoyable
that it may very well be the next best Shakespeare that you can enjoy, other
than ROMEO AND JULIET.; And it
makes for a wonderful evening of entertainment.; This is the best film I have seen in years.; He's always smiling and laughing, and it's infectious.; His productions, like HENRY V, are, by
all standards, plain and simple, period pieces, with excellent acting, and
well thought out film scenarios to help the play come across as
well written, and well thought out.","On the whole, I found
their romance a disappointment.; I call it pretentious.; To my sensibilities - and I'm no stick in the
mud - MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING resonates with no spark whatsoever.; That would
be bad enough, but director Kenneth Branagh puts the words on the
screen and all but puts a bouncing ball with them.; No kidding: this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours I
have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going."
11973.0,Thirteen Days,1997.0,"How we managed to not blink is quite 
amazing, and even though you already know the outcome before you even see the 
movie it's still fascinating and mysterious.; Still, ""Thirteen Days"" is a potent film which does an excellent job of
taking well-documented historical fact and turning it into a 
suspense-filled drama.; I'm happy to report 
that I was pleasantly surprised on both counts.; Yes, the 
trailer was very nice, but I was even more surprised to discover that I 
truly enjoyed the movie which followed.; Bruce Greenwood beautifully evokes JFK.","And, even worse, the film drags on for the
aforementioned 2 1/2 hours, all failing to build even a semblance of
suspense.; Dramatic family montages, cheap stock footage, cliched characters,
they're all here.; His Boston accent is atrocious and
amateurish.; To make matters
worse, Costner is burdened with a laughable New England accent that
recalls his similarly ludicrous effort in ""Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves"".; Imagine Apollo 13 if it were made really badly -- bad
filmmaking coupled with an ending that you can't change (though
Donaldson actually tries to trick us at many points by interspersing
stock footage of nuclear explosions into the movie, we know better)."
11978.0,Men of Honor,1998.0,"Eventually, the
two men, Carl and Billy, develop a mutual bond and Master Chief Sunday
pulls in markers from his comrades to help Carl achieve his goals -
respected Navy diver and a Master Chief rating of his own.; Men of Honor, based on a true story, tells the tale of Carl Brashear,
the first African-American to reach the rank of Master Chief Diver in
the U.S. Navy (taking place during the pre-scuba 1950's and 1960's).; For students of American history, for those who knew but forgot, for
those who are deluded into thinking It's All In The Distant Past, for
those who want to remember American war heroes - or even for those who
just want to see a damn good movie, MEN OF HONOR is a must-see.; It is an inspirational true
story of a unique man that broke the Navy's color barrier for himself and
those like him.; While Gooding does a good job in portraying Carl Brashear, Robert DeNiro
stands out as the gruff, tyrannical Master Chief Sunday.","Bad, Bad institutions!"".; The production is
generally overwrought, the dialogue is trite, it's about 25 minutes too
long and it includes that most dreaded of clichés, the climactic
courtroom scene, complete with an emotionally manipulative score.; Too bad that after two-plus hours of meandering about, nothing in the
movie leaves you with much determination to do anything except go to the
bathroom.; Worse yet, Gwen (Charlize Theron) 
who seems to be De Niro's child-wife, is a totally useless, unclear 
and unneeded character.; And all his is vitiated by 
bucketfuls of movie cliches, excessive  colorfulness, improbable 
dialogue and speechmaking, paint by numbers progression, and much 
else that required a suspension of disbelief."
12088.0,Fortress,1994.0,"The set design is
excellent, and the action scenes are well-paced, if lacking in
legitimate surprises.; Meanwhile he wins the hearts and minds of all the
prisoners but the toughest con and he proves he has guts by taking a
punishment intended for a weaker friend.; Comments:  FORTRESS offers a cliched, bleak, apocalyptic future and some
rather gory violence, but it still manages to be an entertaining sci-fi
thriller.; Christopher Lambert is probably a
better actor than the role deserves, and he occasionally manages to
make Jack Brennick believable.; Christopher Lambert and Loryn Locklin play such an unlucky couple who,
despite their best efforts, are discovered to be expecting a second child
(their first died very young) by the authorities.","What probably saves this movie from being a turkey is its
storyline.; Ultimately, FORTRESS is nonsense, even if the slick futuristic
setting tries to put a new spin on the tried and true chase sequences.; There was a breed
of science fiction writing called ""space opera"" because it was really just a
bad Western or ""horse opera"" translated to a science fiction story just by
making substitutions.; FORTRESS isn't terrible science fiction, but it's far from the
top.; But generally he just
is not a very good actor."
12103.0,Don't Say a Word,1983.0,"The best aspects of Word come from the most unexpected places.; Despite its flaws, Don't Say a Word is surprisingly some of the best
mainstream film you'll find this month -- and audiences will lap it up.; There are just enough
twists to keep you guessing, and the acting is solid from Famke Janssen, as
Jessie's temporarily incapacitated mother, to Sean Bean, as the omnipresent
leader of the kidnappers.; Among the film's most satisfying twists is the story's final resolution.; Directed by Gary Fleder, this entertaining thriller delivers the goods.","The 56-year-old Douglas is paired with the 36-year-old Dutch-
born Famke Janssen, a woman whose youth belies her lack of
appeal as an actress.; Additionally, the use of the
surveillance cameras and laptops to track Nathan's every move is
downright unbelievable.; Even
worse, it takes no chances, mines no new territory, but instead
plays that old war horse, the race against time.; Oliver Platt, Famke Janssen, and
even Sean Bean are decent actors, but the stuff they are given here --
such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her
crutch -- is insulting and demeaning.; In a failed
attempt to offer complexity, Fleder juggles several balls
throughout the film as it plods on to its predictable conclusion, but
this succeeds only in making the slick story more convoluted
than it needs to be."
12117.0,Instinct,1998.0,"It's an excellent
driving score.; Stan Winston's computerized gorillas are incredibly
realistic and Danny Elfman's score, although not great, is at times
effective.; Perhaps, like the human race itself, ""Instinct,"" far from flawless is
nonetheless seductively imperious, and yes, as lovable as a perfect paradox.; I think that Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors, and
he chews the scenery in this movie, brilliant as ever.; Caulder's goal is to determine what turned Powell into a killer,
but the deeper he digs into his patient's psyche, the stronger becomes his
determination to win the man's freedom.","The plot is predictable, and the script is further let down by some
one dimensional characterisation and some clichéd dialogue.; Perhaps its biggest
failing is that it's just not very interesting.; Another disappointment is the lack of background supplied for the
character of Theo Caulder.; It's just not a terribly well-made
one.; But instead of coming up with something reminiscent of, say,
_The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_ (whose spirit Turteltaub clearly tries to
evoke) the soggy result is more along the manipulative lines of
_Patch_Adams_--which, coincidentally enough, was an attempt at a ""heavy""
effort by ""light"" director Tom Shadyac."
12121.0,Made in America,1999.0,"The first is very funny.; Zora is
understandably upset but quickly pacified by Sarah, with whom she has a
wonderful relationship.; Cast: Whoopi Goldberg, Ted Danson, Nia
Long, Will Smith, et al.; Following confrontations between Sarah and Hal, miscellaneous
sheenanigans and physical mishaps involving people, a bear, an elephant,
a bicycle and a car accident, there grows (predictably) real affection
between Sarah, Zora and Hal, and love inevitably blossoms between Mama
and Papa.; He is very likable, a kinetic delight who delivers his lines with
sympathetic zest.","Had the comedy been less fresh, MADE IN AMERICA might have lost me
early on.; The naysaying reviewers find the Goldberg-Danson relationship to be the
film's saving grace, but in fact Sarah and Hal generate neither mutual
electricity nor sexiness.; Unfortunately, the comic momentum fades as the film
moves to a climax, with the big ""plot twist"" near the end seeming like
something out of bad television melodrama.; .Of course, in restrospect, the movie is slighter, kinda
dumber and more forgettable than when you watch it.; But this is either a red
herring or a politically correct joke."
12122.0,Village of the Damned,1997.0,"Reeve conveys a wider range of emotions.; [Spoiler warning: For those unfamiliar with the story, VILLAGE OF
THE DAMNED has many small mysteries for the viewer starting with the
very first scene.; ""Mother by Protest""), Theodore Sturgeon's ""More than Human,""
and Jerome Bixby's ""It's a Good Life.""; Unlike Carpenter's previous
remake attempt, 1982's THE THING, VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED doesn't rely
on gruesome special effects in place of a well-constructed
atmosphere.; Following the requisite nine months, the blessed 
events occur virtually simultaneously, giving Midwich a group of tiny 
new residents.","Based on the 1960 screenplay of the original of this sci-fi
horror, which is based on John Wyndham's book THE MIDWICH CUCKOOS, this
is a disappointing film for Carpenter.; There are a couple of particularly nasty deaths, there are
two fiery truck crashes, and toward the end there is a half-hearted
action scene with guns blazing.; Instead, all we have is a passable remake.; One of the most disjointed parts of the film
is government Doctor Alley (LOOK WHO'S TALKING XXXVII) who one can never
determine whether she is just an evil representative of Big Brother,
being controlled by the children, or just plain mischievous and dull!; For the most part, VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED looks like a science
fiction film that could have been made in the 60s or 70s that is not
half bad."
12123.0,Chain Reaction,1999.0,"**** Amazing, potent stuff.; The
music (Jerry Goldsmith) is far from subtle.; Beside the impressive special effects (Nick Davis), the
cinematography (Frank Tidy) is awesome.; Eddie Kasalivich and Lily Sinclair
(Rachel Weisz) the head physicist's assistant are framed for the
assassination and explosion.; For those of you who truly believe that Elvis is still alive, I
have a picture that you will find plausible, CHAIN REACTION.","But 
its efforts are all but lost in its weak script and bad acting.; It might have been a better investment in film to give the
characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences, which
frankly, get quite boring after a while.; Keanu is no Harrison Ford, and Fred 
Ward is not even close to being Tommy Lee Jones.; Unfortunately, our intrepid machinist
and an English physicist (Weisz) manage to get away and now follows a
Fugitive-like chase using a  not too dissimilar rehash of that movie
script.; The ice
boat on the frozen lake sequence is a masterpiece of bad logic,
implausibility and poor cinematography."
12143.0,Bad Lieutenant,1950.0,"The film also utilizes humor brilliantly, a fact its detractors
seem not to have noticed.; Because humor is so great a part of what it
means to be a human being, even one in great distress.; 5)  ""For the psychopath is better adapted to dominate those mutually
contradictory inhibitions upon violence and love which civilization has
exacted of us, and if it be remembered that not every psychopath is an
extreme case, and that the condition of psychopathy is present in a host
of people...it can be seen that there are aspects of psychopathy which
already exert considerable cultural influence.""; But at a gut
level, the Lieutenant knows that his actions are self-destructive, that
his quest for the perfect high leads to doom.; Harvey Keitel gives one of the great film performances: creative,
resourceful, convincing, free from actorish mannerism.","Avoid this film at all costs (even eventual cable/video rental)
because it is an overinflated, crashing bore!; Why is this film a bore?; Unfortunately, the movie falls apart in its final third.; If this is the director's way of therapizing as a recovering
Catholic, we can only wish that he had taken Sinead O'Conner's route,
which was a lot quicker, and like jerking a Band-Aid off a hairy arm, a
lot less painful than this tepid, two-hour tug.; Aside from being confusing and relatively pointless, the
last half-hour is also dull."
12150.0,Sea of Love,2000.0,"The movie takes great joy in playing mind games with you,
and it keeps you guessing as to whether Barkin is in fact the killer.; Price has not constructed his screenplay as well as he could have, but his
dialog is excellent, excepting only the final scene.; SEA OF LOVE is worth seeing, for those who like the genre or those who
like Pacino.; He succeeds in providing 
a few tense moments, and keeps up the mood well.; The way the film jumps
forward in time at just the right moments is refreshing.","Even worse, he garbles his
lines so they are almost incomprehensible.; The plot is just not very
clever or intricate, and needs a few more twists to keep up audience
interest.; The plot may have been intended
     to be clever but fails somehow to have anything very
     unexpected.; Director Harold Becker has
done a couple of good films, but none that stand far out from the pack.; But the script does not play with the idea all
that well."
12160.0,Wyatt Earp,1994.0,"He was tougher in A PERFECT WORLD.; Still, he provides most of the film's best moments, al-
though the supporting cast delivers their share as well.; The
film tells the story of how this famous lawman stood up to the scum of
the Wild West and brought them to heel.; Both Gene Hackman and Isabella Rosselini appear and
disappear like magic, while late entries Catherine O'Hara and JoBeth
Williams are surprisingly solid.; Here he makes a movie
full of sweeping grandeur and absolutely wonderful dramatic music
(James Newton Howard) that never stops.","This movie was boring, slow, boring, and slow.; Or was
it just to give the director a dramatic backdrop against which to shoot
the characters?; The scenery is boring.; Quaid was badly miscast.; This is the worst movie that I have seen in years."
12186.0,Defending Your Life,1998.0,"""Defending Your Life"" is one of the funniest and most clever comedies that
I've seen released this decade.; This is a brilliant idea for a film and Brooks pulls it off perfectly.; This movie is very sweet and good-natured and very funny.; The music by
Michael Gore is excellent.; And the supporting cast does an outstanding job,
especially Rip Torn as Daniel's defender.","What could have been a view
into Brooks's personal philosophy suffers greatly from the apparent
shallowness of that philosophy.; Likewise, Lee Grant was utterly colorless as the
prosecuting attorney.; This was a mistake.; Jim, my husband, wished Robert Preston was alive to play Mr.
Diamond, because Rip Torn gave an annoying, two-note sort of
performance.; Rating: low +1."
12187.0,Heart and Souls,1998.0,"I liked it a lot, I'll see it again, I
recommend it.; HEART AND SOULS is an overwhelmingly charming, sweet,
heart-warming, and old-fashioned movie.; The light ""life after death"" fantasy is still with us.; It's an old fashioned movie with a fairly simple story to tell and a
childish innocence in the way it tells it.; Now he is showing an amazing
flair for physical comedy and a tremendous versatility.","The above description attempts to capture some of the nuances of a
needlessly-convoluted and poorly-conceived storyline that someone
should have had the intelligence to pare down to reasonable levels.; There are also a few mildly humorous
interludes with a police officer, although the conclusion of that
particular subplot is laughably bad.; There are a few energetic scenes that save this production from
being an utter debacle.; Partially as a
result of being too obvious about its intentions and partially because
of heavy-handed direction, it doesn't succeed.; When a rapport hasn't been
developed between the characters and the audience, attempts to make us
cry can end up looking rather silly."
12211.0,Highlander: Endgame,2000.0,"_Highlander:_Endgame_ is a film made for the devotees, and I'm
sure I speak for everyone else when I say that I am more than happy to
simply let that select group have and keep it.; He's also very
funny, not purposely though.; Send to: johnbeachem@dependentfilms.net Past reviews can be found at:
http://www.epinions.com/user-elerad?public=yes or 
http://us.imdb.com/ReviewsBy?John+Beachem * * * * * - One of the best movies of the year.; The soundtrack is quite 
nice, being a lovely mixture of classical and Scottish music.; However, I was 
surprised to find that the traditional ""Highlander"" theme song by Queen is 
missing.","Disjointed, incoherent, boring, corny, filled
with bad dialogue...and that's just the first thirty minutes!; Problem is:
it's disjointed and tiresome.; It's a slow-moving piece of garbage with choppy
fight sequences and bad acting.; I, however, not being a 
member of this cinematic cult found the plot to be an impenetrable mess.; The pacing is so poor you'd think a twelve year old had directed it; 
the dialogue is bad, bordering on painful; the special effects could have 
been done on a home computer; and like the previous sequels, this one just 
doesn't fit in with the ""Highlander"" timeline."
12212.0,Urban Legends: Final Cut,,"Even more so than in ""Scream 3,"" the way that reality and fiction intermix is 
extremely well done.; Easily the most innovative twist in ""Urban Legends: Final Cut"" is the way the 
ill-fated characters become literal pawns in urban legends brought to life, 
all the while Amy's movie on the very same subject films on at the same time.; Both are very nice, 
and the score is a standout, when this dvd comes out, I would like to see a 
isolated score, just to hear this, because it adds much to the tight 
atmosphere.; It has some tense moments, funny moments, an exciting murder sequence
that should gross anybody out, and a decent little premise set in a perfect
place to develop a great story (film sets).; This was very gruesome and quite intense.","There is simply no reason to waste your money on this movie, which 
wouldn't be worth seeing if it were the only thing showing in town.; As blood 
splatters everywhere, the film uses every cliché in the horror movie 
writer's manual, from stupid victims to loud noises.; No, all the blame can rest 
firmly on the shoulders of the film's three writers (another bad movie with 
multiple writers.; They are the most stupid, meaningless, predictable and soulless films in existence.; Stupid...just plain dumb!"
12219.0,12 Angry Men,2001.0,"My only complaint with Lumet's direction is that the last holdout
for guilty is allowed to convert all too abruptly.; Nevertheless, 12
ANGRY MEN is a nearly perfect drama to be savored by generation after
generation.; Most writers would gloss over
some of them to concentrate on a few, but Rose gives each a unique
personality and background.; Today, 12 ANGRY MEN is a considered to be classic, one of
the greatest films made by 1950s Hollywood.; The beauty of Rose's script is that we come to know each of the
jurors by the end of the deliberations.","Perhaps 12 ANGRY MEN
should have been the opportunity to introduce new category
of ""Oscars"" - given for collective performances.; If you didn't know better, you could assume
they were reviewing some movie they had seen.; ""Now
these are facts,"" barks an angry juror played by Lee J. Cobb.; He
ticks off the facts in the case as if he were reading closing stock
prices from the newspaper.; To further minimize
distractions, we never learn most of the jurors' names."
12254.0,Emma,1994.0,"I am not
sure if its lightweight stems from the novel itself or the adaptation,
but it is nevertheless a sweet little film and well worth seeing.; **** Amazing, potent stuff.; For
the record, my favorite Jane Austin movie remains PERSUASION which was
also my favorite of all the 118 films I saw last year.; I
certainly did -- it's funny, and the performances are wonderful.; It
is something of a surprise to see Greta Scacchi in a smaller role as
the ex-governess.","With a main
character that there was some reason to care about, this could have
been a much better film.; The film that McGrath was making
-- without the social context -- shd have collapsed this incident
quickly -- it would have been better even if Mr. K mentioned it
immediately after his proposal (""Oh, by the way, you'll be sorry
to hear that...."") Okay.; Right up there with the
worst shots in FRANKENSTEIN!; Each is called
Mister or Miss or Mrs. Something, and each of them looks and acts *exactly*
the same (obnoxious).; The film doesn't depict Emma's gradual understanding of
Churchill's lack of true qualities, and fails to capitalize on 
her attempts at self improvement after the picnic."
12257.0,Home Fries,1992.0,"This movie is a lot of fun.; And the funniest scenes in the movie happen at the
Burger Matic.; The man behind many of the greatest X-Files
episodes, a man known for his knack at combining humour with great
dialogue and in-depth looks at the Mulder/Scully relationship.; With plot
twists galore and hilarious dark moments, this is sure to entertain.; As Dorian, Luke Wilson delivers a touching portrait of a troubled guy.","I've no idea whether the choppy resolution of 
their stories is the result of sloppy writing or poor editing, but the 
unfinished feel is quite frustrating.; Also
the murder plot is just not that funny, and when it becomes more
involved, it just becomes a sick joke that goes on for too long; and,
the film ends with a one-too many helicopter scene that couldn't be more
ridiculous.; Although I appreciate the fact that director 
Dean Parisot and screenwriter Vince Gilligan were trying to make an 
original film, it simply doesn't work.; A climactic helicopter chase was annoying 
and failed to salvage my last remaining hope for the movie.; The
     timing was off or something else intangible, but the film just did
     not work."
12395.0,Thunderheart,1999.0,"We also
see his constant interaction with Crow Horse and a Native American woman,
Maggie Eagle Bear (Tousey), who is the typical, sensitive, intelligent
teacher/environmentalist.; When the
local sheriff, Walter Crow Horse (Greene), tries to help Ray and Cooch by
advising them to get in touch with nature, they of course ignore and mock
him.; Some note should be made of Graham Greene's performance as a
reservation policeman.; Most Hollywood thrillers tend to use confusion as a cop-out, and although
this film is confusing at times, it doesn't placate to the viewer until the
final act.; Good guys get to fight for
their land, their homes, and principle.","Capsule review:  Awful cliche-ridden script about a
     murder case on the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation.; Oh, heck, I know director Michael Apted's heart was in the right place,
but John Fusco's script was just awful.; For all it has going for it, ""Thunderheart"" certainly is a disappointment.; Twenty-five years ago this would
have been a good script but it has been used, with variations, just too
often.; If enough people confuse
compassion for American Indians with liking this film, Tri-Star Pictures
could make a bundle of money, almost none of which will go to help the
Indians."
12478.0,Skin Deep,1999.0,"More recently he has also made some very
funny films like S.O.B., 10 and VICTOR/VICTORIA.; All I can say is that it is probably the funniest scene in the movie.; One of my favorite songs by the Stranglers includes the lyric,
""You'd better watch out for the skin deep.""; Zach's excessive drinking is clearly ruining his
life, but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain.; My final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of
alcohol and alcoholism.","Zach is supposed to be charming and
charismatic, but I failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him.; Most of the jokes are dumb,
predictable, and sitcomish.; To add insult to injury, Edwards gives his large supporting cast
nothing but stereotypes with which to work.; Because we don't care the slightest bit about anyone in SKIN DEEP,
the film's few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail.; Overall, the laughs in SKIN
DEEP are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the
film to stay afloat."
12479.0,Breakfast of Champions,1994.0,"I've seen some negative reviews of this movie and I think it is one
you will either love or hate.; Thank you for flying in our friendly high
skies.; Kurt Vonnegut is my favorite
author ever, and BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS was his first book that I read.; And coming to see

a minute.; Everyone else--and I'm hoping that's most people--would be wise to steer
clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess.; In the midst of this
muddled mess, the town decides to honor a mumbling, misunderstood
pulpy science-fiction writer named Kilgore Trout (Albert Finney) at
its first arts festival.; Oh, and Trout's son (Haas)
wants to be a lounge singer named Bunny."
12489.0,Gridlock'd,1941.0,"GRIDLOCK'd is refreshing because it's different.; It's a universally shared affliction, and 
that's why Terry Gilliam's brilliant BRAZIL resonates so forcefully with 
viewers.; The first time I saw Thandie Newton was in the beautiful 1992
Australian coming-of-age film, FLIRTING, where she was a lovely
teenaged innocent in love with a white boy.; All buddy movies need solid chemistry between the leads, and 
GRIDLOCK'd has it.; It's a darkly humorous, vicious satire, and, like all the best 
satires, it works because so much of what transpires on screen not only 
could happen, but does happen -- every day in every major urban area 
across the country.","The worst thing about GRIDLOCK'D is that it takes a basically
interesting idea and surrounds it with prefab plotting, and the idea
is forced to surrender.; The entire sequence of events seems designed merely
as an excuse to get Spoon and Stretch running, while the other primary
plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time.; I laughed some, but can not
recommend the movie.; There's also a cameo by Elizabeth
Pena as an ER nurse who gets her own sadistic little form of revenge
on the two of them when they show up for treatment in her ward not
once but twice.; He trashes a social services office and accidentally provides the cover
for our protagonists to make a fast exit from the law."
12498.0,Sling Blade,1996.0,"No, nothing is
shown on screen, but they add a grim-- and at times gruesome-- subtext
to an equally endearing and, even, hilarious tale.; It is a marvelous character Thornton has written for himself, and he
does an astonishing job of bringing Karl to life.; Is he still dangerous, or 
just the ""gentle, simple man"" others see him to be?; One is the
subtle emphasis on the characters' dark, secret past that affect their
present life and the deep, complex nature of human psychology and
motivation.; Lucas Black and 
Natalie Canderday are both believable, and John Ritter is surprisingly 
effective playing against type as an effeminate homosexual.","Why the nice woman puts up with
the monster is inexplicable, unless this indicates a major shortage of
males in the area.; Then, there is Doyle, who is
obviously a very unlikable red-neck, who drinks, talks dirty, verbally
abusive and treats children badly (that's a big sign for ""villain"").; Karl is not all there mentally, but certainly does not deserve to be called
jeeringly ""a retard"" by the film's heavy.; There are writers who
get a shot at directing films, and actors who do some writing, and
film-makers who take the occasional turn in front of a camera, but in
most cases you can tell you are watching a writer direct, or an actor
write, or a director act.; Sometimes it is difficult to *not* resist the hype surrounding a movie."
12499.0,Fathers' Day,1999.0,"They work extremely well together to make this a most
enjoyable film.; This
is a very good role for Crystal.; Sometime in that period,
right before she married her true love (Bruce Greenwood), she slept with
both Dale (Robin Williams) and Jack (Billy Crystal).; These two men, alone, are hilarious, how hysterical can they get if they 
are together?; Needless to
add, the movie is hilarious, a worthy successor to Les Comperes which
starred, in 1984, Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu.","The painful, predictable result is a dearth of mirth.; It just doesn't work.; But even that would have been okay if someone had thought to write some
jokes into the script or tell what story there is with some kind of flair.; There are
a few times where their chemistry shows through the mess and those
meager minutes are what saves the film from being a total waste of time.; Unfortunately, it comes off as an old trick reaching for
insincere laughs."
12505.0,Little Nikita,1999.0,"To all those who want to see better films starring River Phoenix, I

good.; It is very rare to
see Caan putting this much expression in a role and clearly enjoying
himself.; Overall this is an amiable but unexceptional comedy.; HONEYMOON IN VEGAS is a romantic comedy with an excellent cast and
a first-rate director-writer.; Cage does wonderfully as a man who didn't know what he had
until he lost it.","As if the basic situation were not absurd enough, Bergman
goes over the line with a running joke about Elvis impersonators that
culminates in a scene so full of plot holes and so unlikely as to
qualify as a contemporary version of the deus ex machina who has solved
so many dramatic and comedic situations throughout the history of
theater.; The film is just two Elvises short of pushing the
gag too far.; What does all this have to do with Elvis?; He sets him up as a sympathetic, if
unprincipled, character, not unlike Brando's Godfather parody, and then
in the last ten minutes turns Tommy into the blackest and most vile of
men, destroying the dynamic and ambiguity that had made the rest of film
complex and interesting.; At least two scenes appeared
totally washed out in the print we saw."
12519.0,Sirens,1969.0,"SIRENS is a witty, fanciful, and wonderfully upbeat comedy with a
dramatic side as well.; The film never breaks from its investigation of the two different
lifestyles and views on sex, nudity and blasphemy portrayed by the two
families--often this theme takes on a ironic nature and is fascinating
and ultimately thought-provoking.; All of the
performances were delightful.; The acting is uniformly good, especially the surprisingly good
performance by Elle MacPherson.; Many great scenes in the show.","Campion tries his hardest
to argue for the church with a ""non-fundamentalist"", contemporary point
of view hoping to reach Lindsay, but he ultimately fails miserably.; Campion believes that the displaying of such offensive work as
Lindsay's would make a permanent impression in the mind of the viewer
and corrupt them.; Macpherson and Fischer
look good, but they're given too much to say and it's never all that
interesting when they do speak.; If there is any fault to be found with Duigan's script, it's that
he does skimp on his characters in the interest of establishing his
analogy.; The story lags at times, De Rossi's innocent
character isn't completely credible, and plot turns are
both predictable and unlikely (a train derailment strands
Grant and Fitzgerald at the Neill estate, and prim Fitzgerald
becomes involved with the decadent models)."
12521.0,Shocker,1992.0,"Don't expect a film as original or as
well executed as the the first ""Elm Street,"" but if your nature is more
forgiving than The Phantom's, you might find it quite enjoyable.; See it for its top-notch camera work and for the way Craven can set up a
scene, be it a FRIDAY THE 13TH-like attack in a bathroom or a NIGHT OF THE
LIVING DEAD-like chase through a park.; For all it's flaws, SHOCKER is mostly fun, and if you
don't mind the lumbering plot, it's almost never boring.; Yet Our Hero Jonathan Parker can sense him in his dreams (shades of
""Elm Street"" here), and even join him as he stalks and kills various family
members in a house miles away.; For a while, Horace is a run-of-the-mill mass
murderer.","Someone
decided that audiences don't really want to see horror films that are filled
with horror; instead, they'd rather watch a watered-down ""Elm Street"" clone.; But sadly Craven doesn't seem to know what to do with Horace; during the
first half of the film, Horace is strictly a devil worshiping maniac (actually,
a television worshiping manic, though the Phantom has long believed them to be
one in the same), but as the film progresses, Horace becomes more and more like
Freddy, thus doing himself and his audience no favor at all: if we wanted
Freddy (and after the disappointing NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 5 it's not clear
that we do any more), we'd head for our local Blockbusters.; Why waste half an
hour on a traditional Hero Chasing Murderous Lunatic plot when it turns out to
be almost entirely irrelevant to the remainder of the film, which is anything
*but* traditional and in fact borders occasionally on the truly weird?; With the exception of Horace, the
characters -- and the actors who portray them -- are uniformly bad, as is the
dialogue (although Horace does get in a few good lines, Freddy-style, toward
the end).; We'll start
with the plot, although even with his Official Phantom Film Reviewer's Notebook
(R), the Phantom was unable to jot down all of the loose ends, false starts,
missed opportunities, and what looked to be the outcome of a few too many
script conferences with nervous studio executives."
12524.0,Titus,1998.0,"In many ways, it is a beautiful
film that is ambitious, creative, and showcases superb
acting.; In any case TITUS ANDRONICUS is a play rarely performed
and though it will not be for all tastes it is one that for many of us
should be seen because it is a hoot.; And you bet your ass ""Titus"" has excellent
performances.; In terms of interpretation, Taymor's adaptation is brilliant.; But, I was
impressed with what I saw.","This sequence lasts an astoundingly tedious 5
minutes.; Julie opens ""Titus"" with a strikingly lame introduction that is
supposed to link the play to modern times.; I'm having a hard time putting my finger on exactly why TITUS
actually left me marginally impressed instead of bored by the director's
""hey, check out what I can do"" style.; But there isn't much else going for this picture.; How silly."
12574.0,Cop,2000.0,"An excellent
performance, a balancing act that works like a charm, and it continues to  keep
Woods in my book of the five best character actors working in  American film
today.; He does it again in COP, which almost (but not quite) makes it as an 
excellent film.; True, he often plays
roles where his character is on the edge (of lunacy, of society, of moral and
ethical behavior), but he scintillates in such parts.; And
the script has a good sense of the humorous, though it's often rather  morbid.; The burglar's monologue as the opening credits roll by, and  Woods' evening
story to his 6-year-old daughter, seeded with police terms  like an official
report, are quite funny, and liven the film up at  points.","No follow-up on the characters; it  just left me hanging for more.; Well, almost everyone -- 
Charles Haid comes off very poorly as a Beverly Hills cycle cop, perhaps 
because I have a hard time not seeing him as Renko on Hill Street Blues.; So we are left for much of the film trying to figure out whether Woods is 
an obsessive, rather repugnant investigative genius, or whether he is off  his
nut and interpreting a single murder to be the latest in a long line  of
executions.; Its finale is too flawed for me to give the film a full thumbs-up, but 
the it's worth $2.50 - $3.00 for the first 1.5 hours.; The last fifteen 
minutes show that the screenwriter, who had some very good moments  through the
early part of the film, really lost it in the end."
12596.0,Pushing Tin,2000.0,"Go because
Cusack is surprisingly good and Thornton is predictably good.; The film's
score is also very entertaining and is by Oscar winner Anne Dudley ('The
Full Monty').; Finally, Angelina Jolie, snubbed of an Oscar nod for 1998's ""Playing by 
Heart,"" proves once again why she is currently one of the best and most 
exciting young actresses working today.; The characters are well-drawn and
perfectly acted by the cast, and the movie works when it focuses on the
rivalry between the two stars.; ""Pushing Tin"" is worth seeing because you don't often get
players like Cusack, Thornton and Blanchett bouncing off one
another.","The
worst of the lot, however, is the miscast Billy Bob Thornton.; It's too long, it's boring, and no
character is remotely likeable.; This mediocre rivalry and Nick's laffable ascension would make any of
us assume crash positions.; Cusask's very intentionally charismatic acting becomes
irritating, and Thornton is supposedly portraying a wise, mysterious
character, but he appears like one of those annoying people whose every
spoken word is an attempt to prove their supposed intelligence.; They spend their time horsing around, acting like overgrown kids playing
an increasingly boring video game."
12599.0,Pokémon: The Movie 2000,2001.0,"Even 
though the first movie wasn't a great film, it was definately an enjoyable 
well-made movie with an actual thin storyline.; Well there you go, of course Ash is followed by his friends Misty, Brock, 
Gary and his pokemon friends, Pikachu, Squirtle, Charizard, the usual.; Fans thought it was great and now is a 
second movie in the Pokemon craze, ""Pokemon: The Movie 2000"" which is far 
inferior to the original animated movie.; In fact not many people even knew what Pokemon was, 
but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike, and became one of the 
biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time.; The film has one thing going for it and that is the animation, although not 
up to Disney standards, it is still very good with some interesting CGI's and 
very colorful animation, the colors jump out at you very fast, and seem very 
nicely put on film.","Compared to the first film, this movie is awfully bland, from its opening 
titles, to the end titles it tries its best to work, but fails miserably at 
every corner.; The characters are 1-dimensional, the story thin as chicken 
broth, and the writing very lame.; Even the so called action scenes are 
extremely lame, and falls before it even gets a chance to go.; This new movie however is 
nothing but garbage, there is nothing good to it storywise, and its only good 
thing comes from some plush animation and colors.; The voices even 
aren't that good and almost feels like the stars don't want to be there, like 
they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie."
12616.0,One Night Stand,2000.0,"The two sex scenes in ONE NIGHT STAND are probably the most
disparate I've seen in a single film, and the most uniquely effective.; They don't love each other, 
but they fulfill a need.; A happily
married man with a beautiful wife and two adorable kids, he strayed just this one time a while back, and his life has never been the same since.; Even though the film suffers from its aloof and
uninviting approach, the Figgis genius in staging scenes is very
evident albeit in frequently subtle ways.; ONE NIGHT STAND is at its most
provocative when it finds a man beginning to question everything
fundamental in his life.","As problematic as I found One Night
Stand to be for much of its running time, at the very least it appeared to
be setting up a point.; Charlie is 
basically just a plot device to reunite Max and Karen so they can 
complete their unfinished business.; Kyle MacLachlan, on the 
other hand, is boring.; The blame for that belongs entirely with Figgis, who can't hold the
level of interest built by the film's first half.; The bifurcated movie would have been better served if it had
chosen one subject rather than two."
12618.0,Random Hearts,1997.0,"Two strangers, both married, meet at a train
station and find themselves drawn into a short but poignant
romance.; Dutch's feelings of resentment and 
anger at his own cluelessness over his wife's ""other life,"" are all the more 
effectively-drawn due to Ford's sometimes underrated acting chops.; That Dutch keeps hearing about the crash 
on the news, and yet is oblivious to the fact that his wife has been killed, 
is deeply poignant, and his growing suspicions that the woman he loved was 
not the woman he thought he knew, is a fascinating concept, handled with 
precision and taut direction by Sydney Pollack.; On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Random Hearts"" is a
well-crafted but emotionally distant 5.; I enjoyed bits and pieces of the romance, including a surprisingly
genuine ending that felt much sunnier than most of the garbage that
preceeded it.","The net result is that incidents that
would work quite well with proper motivation instead come completely out
of left field, turning possibly plausible actions into ridiculously
unbelievable ones.; I managed, but did
find this to be a passable film at best, with Ford offering us the worst
haircut of his career, and proof that ""range"" is not his strongest suit as
an actor.; It
seems tacked on almost as an afterthought, a desperate attempt to beef
up a thin plot that is clearly struggling to sustain interest.; Random Hearts is a disappointment, particularly given the calibre of
creative personnel involved.; Torture is the correct term for such a movie, one that spends two hours and
twenty minutes evoking boredom, yawns, and snores from the audience."
12623.0,Suspect,1999.0,"This is a *good movie*.; She brings a
tremendous amount of nervous energy into her character, yet shows excellent
subtleties and complexities.; As much as I liked NO WAY OUT, I think I like SUSPECT even better.; One of my favorite small actors Joe
Mantegna (from HOUSE OF GAMES) plays prosecutor Charlie Stella.; SUSPECT has excellent supporting work, which I thought was a bit weak in
NO WAY OUT.","Actually, the script gets
almost laughable at points.; Unfortunately, Dennis Quaid as one of the jurors was disappointing.; There's potential for an
interesting character there, but Quaid keep his character weak.; Even with the ridiculous script, I managed somehow to like the
performances by Cher and Quaid.; In NO
WAY OUT the emphasis seemed to be on the convoluted plot line."
12628.0,Playing God,1998.0,"Distributor: Touchstone Pictures THE X-FILES has been one of the hottest shows on TV for several 
seasons now, but it has taken until October 1997 for David Duchovny to 
parlay his success in a weekly series into a motion picture lead.; His often under-appreciated work on ""The X-Files"" has demonstrated both
dramatic chops and a wry sense of humor, as well as the requisite
physicality for action.; Hutton, one of the most underrated 
-- and underused -- actors working today, has a considerable amount of 
fun as the escalatingly psychotic villain.; PLAYING GOD is really more of a light-psychological thriller/action pic that
delves into the explication that every little thing you do, whether it seem
important or not, could affect your life in major ways.; Duchovny
is kind of fun even if he is drier than Death Valley.","The ending is predictable: a
mediocre car chase.; But any
discernable intentions are lost in the swirl of clashing ideas and
sensibilities.; Then there's Playing God , which
enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the
union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this
horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch
of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better
movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet.; A scene where Sands is supposed to be undergoing
withdrawal symptoms from trying to kick his drug habit looks like he's
simply snoozing in bed with a lot of nearby chocolates.; When Hutton contorts his face and goes into an off-the-
wall screaming act, you're tempted to say, ""Wait a
minute...you're Timothy Hutton!"""
12635.0,Backbeat,1999.0,"What makes it even more surprising that the characters have such
little magnetism is that, for the most part, the actors portraying them
do excellent jobs.; There is also Astrid's wonderful smile.; This theme is highlighted in one of the film's best sequences,
when Stu plays hooky from a recording session to spend the day with
Astrid, as Softley cross-cuts between the ever rowdier session and
Stu's idyllic encounter.; BACKBEAT is a good film all the way around.; It may be one of the best music biographies ever made.","If it was really this boring why make a movie,
and if it wasn't, why is this movie so?; The bad news is that most of them seem to last all
of about thirty seconds so that the audience is not distracted from the
awful movie about Sutcliffe.; It was hype.; It's a bad memory for me, not a good one.; Within minutes of commencing, this picture betrayed it's homage to
SCANDAL."
12647.0,Billy Bathgate,1987.0,"Overall this is not a perfect portrait of Dutch Schultz and the people
around him, and it could use a bit more action, but it is watchable and
enjoyable.; To me it matters.; Pacino was the mayor that the deputy 
mayor (John Cusack) looked up to in CITY HALL and Hoffman is the 
mob lord that Billy Bathgate (Loren Dean) idolizes.; Like RAGTIME, this is not an adventure film; it is an
opportunity to put the viewer in a well-realized historical setting so that
the viewer can appreciate the situation.; Bathgate realizes that, in Great Depression America, his only 
real chance for monetary success is in the organized crime game, 
which he enters after Dutch Schultz (Hoffman) notices him juggling 
four balls at once (and, yes, he is fully clothed at the time).","It's 
just not a good movie.; Hoffman went on to do the 
bland HERO, Kidman starred in the boring Irish epic FAR AND 
AWAY and Willis, well, does the name HUDSON HAWK ring a 
bell?; There
is not even much dramatic tension.; BILLY 
BATHGATE is about as cliche-ridden as a movie in this genre can be.; If Schultz thought you were cheating him out
of even small money, your life was not worth much."
12651.0,Memphis Belle,1997.0,"Touches like these get in the way of the audience taking the story very
seriously.; Pairs of friendships within the group form, and it works pretty well here,
even though it is through the use of cliches.; I think most
people get some sort of a charge out of seeing airplanes flying and there is
a lot of flying in this film.; But the real visual splendor
is in seeing genuine B-17s taking off and flying together.; Basically Memphis Belle details for the viewer several of the more
common hazards of bombing runs over Germany.","Yet somehow
the film falls short of actually generating real excitement or tension.; So of course we have these cliched characters here.; Capsule review:  Disappointing and undoubtedly
     fictionalized account of the twenty-fifth mission of the
     first B-17 crew to reach that number and be sent home.; **1/2 (out of 4 = OK)
1990, PG-13, 107 minutes [1 hour, 47 minutes]
[war/lighthearted drama]
starring: Matthew Modine (Dennis), Tate Donovan (Luke), Eric Stoltz (Danny),
Sean Astin (Rascal), Billy Zane (Val), written by Monte Merrick, produced by
David Puttman, Catherine Wyler, directed by Michael Caton-Jones.; But we learn little about their
actual combat missions, it's as if making it this far is a walk in the park."
12656.0,Feeling Minnesota,1953.0,"There is both style and substance to the beginning of FEELING
MINNESOTA, as Baigelman opens with an effective montage showing Jjaks and
Sam's intense sibling rivalry as boys, and their mother (Tuesday Weld)
sending Jjaks away to live with his father.; It does a great job of
setting up Jjaks' unstable life, a life which has landed him in trouble
for petty crimes and always trying to please his family; Reeves' wounded
look is just right for Jjaks.; I don't want to dismiss
Baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of Dan
Aykroyd as a crooked cop, and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is
not his fault that Fine Line has chosen to promote FEELING MINNESOTA as a
light-hearted caper.; It's a 
damn good reward, as any heterosexual man can tell you, and 
D'Onofrio puts it to good use, dragging her immediately and 
reluctantly to the altar.; I
loved her in the great low budget film THE LAST SUPPER and thought she
was good too in SHE'S THE ONE.","I blame the script, which seems to promise a plot that will take off, 
revealing some kind of cleverness or insight into the characters.; All the time, you're wondering why those poor actors are 
putting up with it.; Cast: Keanu Reeves, Vince D'Onofrio, Cameron Diaz, Dan Aykroyd, Delroy
Lindo, Tuesday Weld, Michael Rispoli, Courtney Love Director: Steven
Baigleman Screenplay: Steven Baigleman I'm trying to think of a saving, good point to make about this movie,
but unfortunately I can't.; Other than show up, she
does nothing for the picture.; Aykroyd makes a mess of every scene he appears in, but then
to be fair, so does everyone else."
12658.0,Someone Like You...,1994.0,"He's absolutely 
shameless about his sexuality, yet subtly sweet; a well-drawn character 
brought to life by a strong actor.; The sweet and cute SOMEONE LIKE YOU is a whimsical romantic comedy which 
is compartmentalized into nifty sounding little chapters, including 
""Establishment of Intimacy,"" ""The Vocalization of Emotions,"" and ""A Call 
to Arms.""; The supporting cast is
funny, and well placed, as well -- particularly Ellen Barkin as the host
of the late night show.; One, more laughs, two,
more scenes and situations involving Judd and Jackman together, and three,
more romance and believable tension.; In the end, this is still a warm, fuzzy picture with enough wit to
satisfy most audiences in need of a laugh.","Whereas ""The 
Wedding Planner"" tried way too hard for guffaws, inspiring over-the-top 
performances and a clumsily dopey screenplay, ""Someone Like You"" is guilty in 
neither respect.; Whereas ""The 
Wedding Planner"" tried way too hard for guffaws, inspiring over-the-top 
performances and a clumsily dopey screenplay, ""Someone Like You"" is guilty in 
neither respect.; C'mon man, here you've got
a magnetic up-and-coming male lead in Hugh Jackman, a man who radiates
charisma whenever he's on the screen, and the script just flops with
annoying title cards a la ""Frasier"", an extremely boring and generic romance
angle played by puppy dog eyes Greg Kinnear (I like the dude, but did he
have to look that way during the entire movie?); CRITIQUE:
I kept wanting this film to get better, to throw me a curve, to gimme some
oomph, to make better use of its great-looking stars, but sadly, it was not
to be.; Director
Tony Goldwyn (""A Walk on the Moon"") can't avoid cliches like title cards,
schoolgirls making pronouncements directly to the camera and video montages."
12662.0,Psycho III,1996.0,"The film has, for those
willing to accept it, an unexpected modicum of depth and ingenuity, and a
passionate, risky stylization that works marvelously.; Occasionally he mixes colorful references
to Hitchcock and Argento, but he has a very unique style all his own.; True, Mother does stop to straighten a painting on the way to a killing,
(which is undeniably campy, but just as undeniably hilarious and unique in
the filmic context in which it is placed)  Mother, as created in Norman's
mind, is a reflection of HIS perception of her.; And don't miss two of the
best set-pieces from that year, even beating out the many in SOMETHING WILD,
one involving ice-cubes and the other, a thematically brilliant visualization
of Norman and Marion's paths crossing.; That may be one
of the best moments of acting he has ever done.","Please don't skip this film on account of the party line that
believe it to be stupid and unworthy of your time.; Apparently critics believed that Perkins was trying
ONLY for horror, and didn't know what he was doing, resulting in
unintentional camp humor.; In an ordinary 80's horror
film, all of them, at least the unkind ones, would have certainly been
slaughtered, but only one, and the only nice one at that, gets killed while
the others just leave after their stay.; Many
complained that Perkins was courting cliche in having a party of drunken
jerks come to stay at the motel, yet they failed to notice how Perkins
subverted this cliche by having them survive.; When Norman
is ""Mother"" he is behaving in the way he believes his ""Mother"" behaves, and
if he thinks that she is a ""bloodthirsty monster"" which he has every reason
to, than he will BE a bloodthirsty monster when he is ""Mother""."
12663.0,Red Scorpion,1997.0,"Without the benefits of a common language, these two develop
a unique bond between each another that provides the most memorable sequence in
the film.; Everyone's happy.; If
you like this type of movie, you will probably enjoy this film.; Nicolai is ordered to end a growing rebellion in Soviet and
Cuban controlled Africa.; My old address will still work, as well as my new one.","But don't get too excited, this movie could have been better.; It was
unbelievable in a few parts, and technically poor in others.; (Some may claim that such books have a pernicious effect on
the character of those who read them, but as a concern I personally have to
place that somewhere below the potential toxicity of my tooth fillings.); Removing Nicolai's personal struggle would reduce the quality and interest of
this film significantly.; Women (apparently)
like to read slushy romances; men, on the other hand, like to read violent
action novels."
12704.0,Ishtar,1999.0,"He does an excellent job with the character.; And in ISHTAR
he proved to me that he is a good one.; ISHTAR had me laughing hysterically;
not only were the performances genuine and the characterizations humanly
animated, but it created two characters that I could care about, which I am
finding to be a unique trait that usually evades films today.; The acting by Dustin Hoffman and Warren
Beatty was excellent and I found both of their characters to be believable.; Okay, the long and short of it: I thought ISHTAR was a funny, well-acted
and totally enjoyable movie which I highly recommend.","Why should they care
what it cost to make--they were *paid* to see the movie!; ""I'm too big.; And my last little flip remarks bring me to the other point of my article
and that is what the critics (and here I mean the newspaper and TV critics, not
my fellow reviewers on the net) have been doing to this movie, which seems to
be disliking it for how it was made instead of what it contains.; If they cut
corners and the cheapness of a set or a costume gets in the way of your
enjoying a scene, fine, but I know I don't sit around thinking ""boy for 50
million dollars, that camel should be bigger, or better then it is.""; I don't know about the rest of you, but I have had a
number of friends who were fairly good-looking that just couldn't accept their
looks and you felt like shaking them to get them to listen."
12706.0,Croupier,1998.0,"Croupier is that refreshing anomaly, the sleeper hit that keeps the 
system honest.; Director Mike Hodges (probably best-known stateside for the garish
1980 FLASH GORDON) stylishly captures the dim casino milieu and the
choreographed moves of the croupiers, while Owen keeps us involved in what
will happen to Jack.; Right up to the moment of the planned casino heist, CROUPIER is well worth
recommending.; Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is a cool operator who naively thinks that he
always has everything under control.; As the world of
the casino becomes ever more attractive to Jack, CROUPIER builds momentum
towards a resolution that seems certain to have a tremendous kick.","The intricate plot doesn't require any knowledge whatsoever of gambling,
and such insight information might be a detriment anyway, causing you to
pay too much attention to uninteresting minutia.; CROUPIER can't
manage to provide either one.; This could be a sign that expectations were low in regard to how
much of an audience this movie would receive.; It suddenly becomes evident that Mayersberg is going to wrap
things up far too quickly to make the film's conclusion satisfying.; MPAA Rating:  Unrated (could be R for sexual situations, nudity,
profanity, adult themes and violence)
Running Time:  91 minutes."
12774.0,Last Exit to Brooklyn,1995.0,"Uli Edel, a first-time director (I think), did a great job with his
direction and I think has a future in movies.; The actors in this film do a great job.; Although Tralala
is the glue that holds the story together, many of the parts both large
and small are particularly well done.; She is small,
vivacious, funny, and outspoken.; ""I love it,"" she retorted.","The person who I
think put in the worst performance in the film was Stephen Baldwin.; For the record Leigh is 35 but
looks like a very attractive young woman in her 20s.; This scene should have gotten an NC-17
rating for the picture.; Mark Knopfler's ominous
music takes place on the low registers with notes that are out slow and
painful.; The only bad performance I ever saw her give was
in KANSAS CITY, and I blame that more on Robert Altman's direction than
her acting."
12888.0,Belly,1999.0,"Williams's tricks are given an added sheen by the rich colors of Malik
Sayeed's stunning cinematography.; It's a by-the-numbers story about the fall and
possible redemption of two longtime friends and drug dealers, Tommy (DMX,
showing genuine big screen presence and charisma) and Sincere (Nas), one a
badass (Tommy), one more mellow (the aptly named Sincere) and looking for a
stable life for his wife Tionne (Watkins) and their child.; Tommy Brown (Earl Simmons,

13199.0,American Me,2001.0,"This is the story of Santana, wonderfully played by Olmos, and of
his friends, family, and community in the barrio of East Los Angeles.; And he
scares the hell of me and depresses me with the hopelessness of the
cycle in a way few movies or documentaries have ever reached me.; The movie
will rattle your cage, disturb your sureties, and reward you with a
rare, if harrowing, movie experience of real substance.; Olmos sees his movie strictly in didactic
terms as a cautionary tale to young Santanas out there today.; The ensemble acting by the mostly unfamiliar ethic performers is
fresh, original, and forceful.","And I also have to say I would never volunteer to sit through it again.; Honestly, I dreaded its start and
only went in the first place because Lyndol insisted.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

13203.0,Son in Law,1997.0,"This film is just
basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right
mood that doesn't contain much violence or any nudity that is
definitely worth full ticket price.; The cast for this film does an excellent job.; The way he
delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on
the screen.; Carla Gugino does a very good job as the
farm girl gone city girl.; The person who played the
grandfather (Mason Adams, I believe) also does a great job.","The few laughs
garnered by this line of tried-and-true humor aren't worth sitting
through ninety-five minutes of lame drivel.; Oddly enough, with someone marginally less annoying, this could have
been a somewhat charming, albeit predictable, film.; I'm not against happy endings in general, but this kind of
sappiness is impossible to stomach.; The film has its humorous scenes, but these are formula-driven and
lacking in originality.; It's
perfect fare for watching on cable, but not worth the time or effort of
making a trip to a theater."
13207.0,Friday the 13th,1999.0,"So, all in all, an enjoyable movie, for which I award it 7 out of 10.; And
I have to admit, I enjoyed it.; Comments Appreciated!; It's a real tearjerker.; The best of all comes when a young Kevin Bacon (who
graduated from the experience unscathed) is stabbed through a bed
mattress
with an archery arrow.","Dull, even by cheesy slasher-movie standards.; You can probably blame `Friday the 13th' for all the putrid, Grade-Z
slasher film garbage that amassed in the 1980's.; Again,
the lone survivor is a woman, but the ending doesn't make any sense.; The second film isn't as ridiculous as most probably think, but it's just as
dull and padded as the first one.; He was merely a young camper who
had supposedly drowned while the camp's counselors were off having sex, and
now his mother was killing all the counselors at Camp Crystal Lake for
revenge."
13342.0,Fast Times at Ridgemont High,1997.0,"It's January 1997 and, believe it or not, I just saw Fast 
Times at Ridgemont High for the first time.; Cameron Crowe, who has recently hit it big with the 
wonderful JERRY MAGUIRE, knows how people act and interact, 
and scripts it well.; This may tend to date her movies, 
but it also serves as an accessible time capsule to that time.; Even a moment as simple as Judge Rheinhold bopping to the 
radio while washing his car seems to be a perfectly-captured snapshot.; But, like a lot
of eighties movies, it holds its own merit.","In the Heckerling tradition, there's not much of a plot, just 
a series of loosely related scenes, most of which involve sex.; We 
watch Leigh go through one miserable sexual/romantic encounter after 
another, but at least her advice from the more experienced Cates is 
juxtaposed with Brian Backer's coaching from Robert Romanus to some humorous 
effect (after being told to use Led Zeppelin for make-out music, Backer 
plays the ominous, booming  Zep track Kashmir' on his car stereo).; Judge Reinhold takes pride in his burger-flipping 
job, a very young-looking Jennifer Jason Leigh and Phoebe Cates 
work at a dine-in pizza parlor, and dorky Brian Backer takes movie 
tickets while his slimeball friend Robert Romanus scalps concert 
tickets.; The unemployed characters are also seen around the mall, 
with Sean Penn's pothead character Jeff Spicoli attempting to get 
service sans shirt in Reinhold's burger joint and beefy football player 
Forrest Whitaker shoving quarter after quarter into Space Invaders 
and Pac-Man.; One thing director 
Amy Heckerling always manages to do well in these aimless teen 
comedies (e.g."
13346.0,Lucas,1990.0,"Dave Grusin's memorable score, played at the perfect 
moments, certainly helps.; The next scene is brilliant.; Lucas is filled with great performances.; Back in 1986 he had talent, and that is proven here 
as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with 
anger, humor, and pain.; However, you have been missing out on a true masterpeice, the best 
film of 1986, and the best film about adolescent life ever made.","I am not implying that a film has to be pleasant or fun
to be good, but ""Lucas"" is simply painful to watch.; Much of it is painful to watch,
and many of the supporting characters aren't credible.; No wonder, 
since their characters all have problems.; ""Lucas"" is an intelligently written and directed film that
somehow misses the mark.; In lesser movies this 
would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters."
13428.0,Two Hands,1998.0,"Fast-paced, action-packed and immensely enjoyable, Two Hands
is easily one of the most exciting and entertaining locally produced
films for quite some time.; He directs with
remarkable assurance and confidence, and also keeps the action moving
at a rapid pace.; I'm not
sure whether he channeled that energy into a good performance, though
it's certainly an entertaining one.; The film in
question is 'Two Hands,' an engaging and often intense picture that is
fresh, lively and different to the norm.; It's one of many
recent world-wide films about combining comedy in a urban crime pic, though a
new type of pic for the Aussies.","The only weak point of the film is the creaky device centring
around the almost supernatural character of the dead man (Steven
Vidler), who acts as a narrator and moral conscience of the story.; This one is forgettable, but somewhat likable
because of the lead characters.; Which is how he
comes to be involved in a bank robbery, organised by his sister-in-law
(Susie Porter, from the awful Welcome To Woop Woop, etc) and the
incompetent Wozza (Steve Le Marquand).; Perhaps 'Two Hands' could have benefited from
a little more meat.; The
screenplay doesn't delve into stories and debates like 'Pulp Fiction',
and its editing doesn't produce the clockwork pacing that made 'Lock,
Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' fast and furious."
13531.0,Empire Records,1999.0,"But the first
20-30 minutes are great, and worth watching.; Each one has his or her own major problems, all of
which are presented and solved in afterschool special style during the
film's 24 hour time frame.; She's going off to college yet she's dealing with an
addiction to speed, an overbearing father, and a desire to throw herself to
an aging rock star (Caulfield) who's visiting the record store that day.; Written by: Carol Heikkinen.; The film starts great.","A bad film or a film which shows potential but yet
can't avoid going in really bad directions?; They
certainly don't advance the weak story at all.; ""Empire Records"" could have been ""Clerks"" with a budget, but instead it
comes off as just another movie about a group of whiny teens.; Something goes wrong though with the film, and there's not really a specific
moment where it turns to garbage to place the blame.; as every character would be in the
back room goofing off."
13539.0,Here on Earth,1998.0,"The chemistry between the two is real and
touching, and director Mark Piznarski concentrates on the basics.; Still, there are little things that never feel right about this
world.; In
an era when movies have people hopping into bed on their first date,
Piznarski has his actors work on the simple parts of affection, as they
gently brush each others cheeks with the backs of their hands.; The poignant film with its slow and tender rhythms has delicately moving
music to match.; First and foremost, 
Leelee Sobieski, a wonderful and fresh find who has starred in such films as 
1998's ""Deep Impact"" and ""A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,"" and had a small 
role in Stanley Kubrick's 1999 opus, ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" brings true depth and 
sharp-wittedness to her role as Samantha.","It is merely a waste of time, money and talent.; Sam's attraction to Kelley made absolutely no sense in 
that, or any other, context; to say that it seemed to come from way far 
out of left field, would be a gross understatement.; Instead, it's a half-hearted effort in a genre where
heart is all that matters.; The Upshot:
You Know Your Movie Sucked When...the only thing interesting about it 
was the geography fetish the writer seemed to have.; Bad enough that 
Richie Rich and Miss Thang had sex to a bad recital of various states; 
worse yet was Seitzman's inability to keep track of whether his story 
was set in Massachusetts, New York, or Toledo, Ohio."
13554.0,Eight Men Out,1998.0,"Despite its minor weaknesses, ""Eight Men Out"" is an excellent
film that demonstrates a love of baseball and the corruption
of character that occurs with greed.; But it's 
easily one of the better pictures.; In some ways EIGHT MEN OUT makes a good companion piece to THE NATURAL.; But he really scored with MATEWAN, the Eisenstein-esque account of
the coming of the union to a West Virginia coal mining town.; ""Eight Men Out"" tells the story of the Black Sox scandal,
the 1919 Chicago White Sox baseball team that threw that
year's World Series.","Half of the team doesn't know what the other half (who are 
on the take) are doing.; In EIGHT MEN OUT the playing field is more like a 
minefield.; Cusack has several
scenes hanging with kid fans that don't seem completely
credible.; The secret play signals 
become subterfuge.; He took what
was reportedly a modest budget and made an epic historical film."
13567.0,Sleepaway Camp,1996.0,"My suggestion to this film is that you watch it alone first, and
then after that, show it to people.; As my first review, I thought that I would do one of my favorites.; More people get killed, including the 90210 girl, and the owner.; I will not say who it is, you
have to find that out.; The whole time, the audience is kept in suspense wondering who did the
murders.","So ignore the stupid cover of the video box, (because it is stupid, of
course) and get ready to watch a good cheese film.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
13595.0,Airheads,1994.0,"The cast contains some surprisingly good performers.; It wasn't really until I did radio myself that I appreciated
the interaction of the two so much.; It wasn't really until I did radio myself that I appreciated
the interaction of the two so much.; And
all woven into a story that is ideal to display this usage: a metal
trio invades a radio station to get their demo played.; And
all woven into a story that is ideal to display this usage: a metal
trio invades a radio station to get their demo played.","Considering the poor quality of the production in general, and the
screenplay in particular, AIRHEADS appears to be an apt title.; AIRHEADS is not a good parody.; The result is a bunch of jokes based on lame confrontations
between the band members and a militant black d.j., McKean's fatuous
corporate type and each other, consisting almost entirely of
third-grade insults focusing on bodily functions and sexual
preference.; Sadly, they are stretched out over a 90 minute movie.; On the other hand, most of the jokes actually offered up by
the script are either unfunny, obvious, or both."
13685.0,Bottle Rocket,1998.0,"BOTTLE ROCKET, dubbed as ""Reservoir Geeks"", is one of the funniest and
most originally written films I've seen in a long while.; There is also a great last line that
gives us a sense of closure--that things have come full circle.; This describes Dignan perfectly.; All I will tell you is that nothing
leads where you'd expect it, the characters are simple, charming and
wonderful to watch, and the film has a great little ending that will leave
you with a smile on your face (and maybe some sympathy in your heart).; She was
the wonderful lead who played Tita in LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE.","Embarrassingly bad.; I do not recommend this
fairly boring show, and I award it a single * solely for a good start
and for some delicate acting by Lumi Cavazos.; This came across more ridiculous than funny.; It doesn't really seem
to belong in this picture, but at least it's somewhat entertaining.; James Caan's acting in BOTTLE ROCKET has to be the
worse he has ever done."
13703.0,Less Than Zero,2001.0,"And Downey, despite the fact
that the script he's given marches him clean off a cliff, works nicely as
the damned soul.; He has never learned how to really enjoy any of it, and so of course
he's thousands of dollars in debt to a drug dealer (James Spader, also
good).; The movie doesn't try
to conceal its anti-drugs message one bit (a message, mind you, that didn't
appear much in the book).; Jami Gertz takes what could have been a one-note role and populates it with
small tics and mannerisms that make it real and substantive.; His insults have a careful, quiet tone... the very key that he
has always had to remaining hip while hating the hip.","The worst thing about LESS THAN ZERO is how, like a
bad gangsta rap video, it winds up glorifying what it's supposed to be
attacking -- partly because it doesn't know how to be angry enough about its
subject, I think.; We should have smelled disaster with this movie.; It's just not a good movie, despite the presence of three good
actors (Andrew McCarthy, Jami Gertz, and Robert Downey, Jr.) who are given
potentially interesting roles to play.; It spends all of its time
doing what was so chic during the 80s that bothered me so much: making a
point.; Less than Zero makes the mistake of targeting its target audience."
13787.0,Holy Smoke,1998.0,"The film has
perfectly framed scenes and magnificent visuals, and a divertingly
amusing storyline to tune into, even if it gives into its own silly side
and becomes after a fast start mostly a wonderfully entertaining film
touching on many societal nerve points but going nowhere but back into
its own cynical view of life, resorting to a politically safe response
to all its pin pricks about mind control.; Once in a while, first-rate acting meets up with powerful directorial
and cinemagraphic vision to make a truly great film and this time it's
the audience who got lucky.; Ruth is moved by the experience
and the guru's touch of her forehead is the ultimate one for her, and
she thereby seeks to stay in India and adapt to her new spiritual
consciousness: changing her name to the one given her by Baba, studying
meditation, wearing a sari, and endearing herself to the customs of
India while living in a commune in New Delhi.; It's refreshing to see Winslet follow _Titanic_'s phenomenal commercial
success by returning to the edgy roles in smaller films that earned her
recognition in the first place.; Also worth
mentioning is the comic and bizarre contribution of the supporting cast,
including Pam Grier (JACKIE BROWN).","To be fair,
though, she is forced to say some pretty ridiculous lines.; Aside from being predictable on just about every level, Smoke seems to
go out of its way to be disturbing.; If
only it wasn't so ridiculous, it could have been a much more salient
film, even if it were to lose a few laughs along the way.; It's as if the writers had said, ""Wouldn't it be cool if
we had her stroke lipstick across Keitel's face?""; But, asked to give an intellectual
performance devoid of much emotional impact, he's embarrassingly
miscast."
13815.0,Fresh,1939.0,"Witness FRESH, a powerful urban drama that ranks among the
year's best and most devastating works.; Giancarlo Esposito is a subtle and complex figure as Esteban,
and delivers a skin-crawling scene as he describes his lust for Fresh's
sister while cradling his infant daughter.; Nelson's performance is brilliant.; There is no hardcore rap nor heavy beats, just Copeland's score,
which is brilliant.; The strategies that Fresh learn
from his father are used by Fresh in real life.","It would have been a better film if
that had been included.; Instead of going with a docu-drama grainy look, cinematographer
Adam Holender uses a higher-grade stock of film, which results in a picture
that looks optimistic.; Almost every other word spoken in the film is a cuss word except
when one really wants to use a pejorative on someone (black or white),
the vilest name they can think of is ""Nigger.""; Thirteen year old Sean Nelson's performance would make many
older actors envious.; The words themselves at a certain point become meaningless,
particularly when Chuckie tries to convince Esteban that he too should
make deliveries because he's ""got all the dope moves."""
13889.0,Madadayo,1997.0,"The film is warm,
whimsical, tender, and genuinely heartfelt.; However, for a truly brilliant
Kurosawa experience, check out his earlier work first.; With the perfect mix of humility, humor, and acceptance, it's easy to
understand the Professor's popularity.; Matsumura carries the nucleus of the film well, with his subtle sarcasm
and silent revelry.; ""Madadayo"" means ""not yet"" in Japanese and is an
expression used as repeatedly in this absorbing film as ""you
know"" is used in Gen-X-targeted movies produced by
Hollywood.","As kind and humbling as Madadayo is, the plot becomes monotonous.; Not Rated.; Here's why.; He
cannot eat or sleep, cries most of the day, and eventually he
and his students go all-out to locate the truant feline.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
14013.0,BASEketball,1994.0,"It's filled with solid comic
performances, equally effective as both physical and verbal
buffoonery.; Surprisingly, the alliance actually works,
creating a movie that, while not for all tastes, has moments of genuine
hilarity.; It was, quite simply, a masterpiece of comic
timing and truths about the nature of love and it's effects.; Strange as it may seem, David Zucker ends up being the steadying
influence which reins in Parker and Stone.; And so Parker and Stone can really goof off, there's a rule in the game
where the defending team can prevent the shooting team by psyching them out
anyway which way they can, so there's lots of hilarious taunts and
disgusitng jokes (my favorite was Parker drinking fat from a liposuction of
Marlon Brando's ass, which, incidentally, doesn't prevent the shooter from
shooting).","It is a bad film.; Dude, why would you even put those unfunny
outtakes there to begin with?; This
movie starts off with an original premise, a healthy cast of campy actors,
but slowly deteriorates into a ""one-joke"" movie, with a weak plot line and
flat sight gags.; I just sat and watched actors romp around a script that
relies almost entirely on toilet humor.; Some are funny, but so many of
them are just mediocre or not funny at all."
14022.0,Slacker,2000.0,"""Slacker"" is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy,
whatever its flaws, and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved.; For the discriminating ""cult classicist,"" SLACKER is touted as a
must-see.; Linklater's scripted yet candid semi-documentary does a great job of
its subculture , a subculture not one unified by purpose but rather by
aimlessness.; SLACKER is original, inventive and undjudgmentally ironic.; It is simple and straight, but looks surprisingly
professional.","And the dialogue in the second half of the
film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half; a JFK
buff, for example, seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy
theorist, and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique.; Since Linklater only spends a few minutes with each character, the
introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while.; We've seen enough
predictable middle-americans, or alienated loners, in the movies.; Most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are
apparently too menial to be worth mentioning.; ""Nothing really, just hanging around,"" before it gets on your
nerves; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a
little bit more characterization."
14033.0,Soul Survivors,1997.0,"The film opens in nationwide release today, Friday, September 7, 2001.; However, those going in expecting the
usual slice-'n-dice will instead get something quite different.; It also wrapped production two years ago and has
been sitting on the shelves ever since.; Soul Survivors tells the
story of four college-bound friends:  Cassandra (Melissa Sagemiller) is
sweet and innocent.; But my biggest kudos
go out to Sagemiller, who holds her own throughout the entire film, and actually
has you feeling her character's unraveling.","When the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian,
it's clichéd.; Well, it would if the movie
weren't so instantly forgettable.; I mean, showing Melissa Sagemiller running away from visions for about 20
minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy!!; That's a huge problem, since the four main characters are
supposed to be couples.; In his
directorial debut, Steve Carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience
into feeling any emotion."
14034.0,What's the Worst That Could Happen?,1954.0,"Danny DeVito (1998's ""Living Out Loud""), 
likewise, fits comfortably, but unspectacularly, in a role that he has played 
before, and is sure to play again.; Martin Lawrence, who was a comic revelation in 2000's ""Big 
Momma's House"" is back in the type of role he always plays--a jewel thief.; His favorite scene was the same as mine, the Senate hearing.; Danny DeVito walks through his role as Max Fairbanks as a
mini-Gordon Gekko crossed with his Louie De Palma character from Taxi.; Like Sully in ""The Perfect
Storm""--tough, gruff, and a little bit scary.","], but I've certainly seen worse
than ""The Worst"".; Whatís the Worst That Could Happen is a lame, cynical movie trying to
pass itself off as a comedy caper.; is the worst kind of poorly 
made film, because it is so very plain and mediocre it doesn't even inspire 
palpable hatred--the one fun thing about negative reviews.; for me was the inclusion
of WAAAAAY too many characters; what ultimately deflated ""The Worst"" was
its excess.; Martin Lawrence is not funny."
14135.0,Bad Boy Bubby,1999.0,"It is an honest, raw view of the world
through Bubby's innocent eyes.; And the visual imagery in the film is amazing.; In summary, this low-budget film is an amazing experience; its
good points overwhelm its flaws, and I can only say that it's
thoroughly watchable, and probably headed for a cult following.; It is a film that takes its audience into the depths of
brutality and the ugliness of human experience yet it reaches out in hope of
finding meaning for the experience.; It isn't simple eroticism.","Whether this
is poor editing or structural storyline weakness requires a more
knowledgeable critic.; He is the premise for BAD BOY BUBBY, a defiantly original
Australian movie about a man called Bubby (Nicholas Hope) who has spent his
entire life in an awful little apartment, etc., etc.; He has a rudimentary grasp of language, mouthing monosyllables and
repetitions of his mother's phrases.; He is seduced by a young woman from a Salvation Army band (how an
anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere
hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages,
wisely); he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress; he insults a
traffic cop and is punched in the stomach; he shares a few beers in the
back of a truck with a rock group; he is imprisoned and raped; he becomes a
translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond
comprehension; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse (Carmel
Johnson) .; If your sense of humour runs to blow-up dolls with huge breasts and nipples
that flash on and off like Christmas tree lights, then this movie is for
you."
14195.0,Cecil B. DeMented,1996.0,"Waters even comes up with a catchy little song and a motto, ""Demented 
Forever,"" that will likely stay with you and remind you of this wacky 
and thoroughly enjoyable movie.; Overall, the ride is fantastic; it's one of
Water's best films to date and this year's Fight Club for filmmakers.; The film moves with zigs and zags like the Magic Bullet of Kennedy's
assassination.; John Waters has just about attained respectability in recent years with
his sweet natured ""Pecker,"" satiric ""Serial Mom"" and nostalgic ""Hairspray.""; CECIL B. DEMENTED finds John Waters insisting that his
brand of underground film-making is still the way to go.","None of these characters elicit much 
interest or inspiration.; Pumping out comic-book adaptations, terrible sequels to
mediocre films, and remakes of foreign films to the nearest American
movie multiplex mall theater equipped with thin walls and bad sound
systems.; Cecil's intent is to shoot a film titled ""Raging Beauty"" 
about outlaw filmmakers who bust in and out of multiplexes, production 
meetings and more multiplexes to proclaim their rant that Hollywood, 
basically, sucks!; His last excruciating 
film, ""Pecker"", was so flatly staged that it induced boredom more than 
anything else.; Unfortunately, it can't sustain its cool
concept and devolves into a drive-in dumpster denouement."
14268.0,Startup.com,2000.0,"Although they each have their own families and loved ones, 
which we see in glimpses, their bond is just like a marriage.; Still, ""Startup.com"" packs more drama than most fictional films currently in
release and documents a distinctive moment in America's business landscape.; They didn't get what they had expected,
but they did capture drama aplenty in ""Startup.com.""; As much the story of the rise and fall of a dot.com as of the unravelling of
a lifelong friendship, ""Startup.com"" focusses on govWorks cofounders Kaleil
Tuzman and Tom Herman.; It may not rank with Alexander Graham Bell's idea of long distance voice 
communication, but the team at govWorks.com does have a vision.","Perhaps some judicious editing would help, 
but the subjects, themselves, are the real problem.; The film is frequently, often unintentionally, funny.; There is an attempt to introduce humanity into the mix 
by showing Thomas taking care of his young daughter and Kaleil having 
girlfriend troubles, but these are mere distractions and only serve to make 
an overly long film even longer.; The makers do a decent job of capturing all aspects of the 
making of a startup company but they, unfortunately for the viewer, picked 
the wrong subjects.; About the only song in the film is ""Money (That's All I Want),"" which 
just about sums up the approach of these two hard-working entrepreneurs."
14273.0,Dark Days,1999.0,"Julio also keeps
pets and, along with his friend Lee, takes us through a picture show of
his former cats, birds and assorted animal companions (Miss Peaches, a 
gerbil, apparently being a favorite) like a Cheech and Chong of the pet set.; Singer paints a fascinating portrait of a resilient and inventive (burglar
alarms fashioned out of pot lids) group of people even as we're told that
80 percent of them are crackheads.; Still, ""Dark Days"" is an engrossing account of a world most of us could
not have imagined inhabitted by people whose fates we care about.; He slowly allows the characters to
build before showing a few of them recounting how they ended up in the
tunnels (Dee and Ralph both because of the horrific fates of their children).; Twenty year old British filmmaker Marc Singer moved in with his subjects,
homeless people living underground in New York City's Amtrak tunnels, for
two years and utilized them as his crew to produce the documentary Audience
Award winner of this year's Sundance Film Festival, ""Dark Days.""","The conclusion is too simple.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

garbage into profits, claiming he can find just about anything a person
would want for free."

and takes from it..."" The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; If you're into country music, you'll enjoy a lot of wonderful
cameos by celebrities such as Randy Travis and others in scenes where
Jack Taggert escorts his girlfriend around town.; I guess
in my heart, I still carry that simple wish that he'll get back into
whites and rescue another battle cruiser from the claws of terrorists.; He won't go deserting us to do Hamlet on
Broadway, or take a pay cut to work on an independent film.","Slow and plodding, this project is a total mess.; The first hour is pretty bad, with Seagal's EPA agent attempting to
infiltrate a small mining town as a church sponsored handyman whose work
attire inexplicably includes designer black-leather jackets.; Pretty thin as a plot, but what is expected of a
Seagal film?; And his soap box message wears
 thin within the first 15 minutes.; Synopsis: 
To set up the situation, the first five minutes of this movie explain
that an evil mining corporation is illegally dumping radioactive waste
in the backwoods of Kentucky, and that EPA agent Jack Taggert (Steven
Seagal) is being sent to Kentucky to convince the scared local
townspeople to testify against the big bad company."
14362.0,Out for Justice,1957.0,"Instead of moralising, film presents things like
corruption and symbiotic relationship between police and
organised crime as something quite natural and, at times,
even beneficial to the society.; I know this guy can
act: he was awesome in ""Raising Arizona"" as Goodman's partner in crime.; And Forsythe more than once
threatens his family.; On the other
hand, other actors are quite solid in their roles, even when
they are thankless, like those of Madano's brother and
sister, played by Anthony De Sando and Gina Gershon.; And, naturally, in a
situation when everyone wants to see quick justice done,
issues like civil liberties and police procedure are thrown
through the window.","I couldn't believe how bad this
scene was - the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the
maximum emotional effect (ahem!).; Steven Seagal's character might be
obnoxious, intimidating and ultraviolent and the only thing
that actually align him to the forces of Good (apart from
couple of obviously manipulative attempts to show his
sensitive, altruistic side) is the fact that the villains
are even worse and, consequently, can be dealt only by
higher doses of their own medicine.; It's so
stupid that it's boring.; I already mentioned Gina Gershon (who's pretty horrible in this one), as
well as William Forsythe, who over-acts terribly.; But the guy makes worse films than Reagan
did."
14522.0,Black Beauty,1990.0,"This, of course, makes love and triumph even more
appreciated.; I rate it *** 1/2 and recommend
it to all.; The key ingredient for success in the show, was having a strong
narration throughout by Black Beauty himself.; were all top-notch.; Besides the perfect scripting and directing, there are many other
marvelous aspects to the show.","The
homogenized and safe movie they end up with, offends no one, but bores
half of the audience.; I came very close to giving it all 4 stars.; This was not done in some trite fashion as in all those
movies where the babies talk to us.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
14585.0,In the Company of Men,1996.0,"And its utterly brilliant.; Though far from enjoyable,
LaBute's first film is immensely thought-provoking.; Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) are two very 
different guys with a great deal in common.; Aaron Eckhart plays Chad with macho evil and is one of the best
screen villains in a long time.; Unpredictable and wholly unique, IN THE COMPANY OF MEN is a powerful
moviegoing experience.","It's too depressing; there's 
absolutely no satisfaction to be had here.; I didn't see any, riveted as I was by the nastiness on the screen.; He merely wants
someone so pathetic and so low-status that she would never leave him.; That what comes out of these conversations, to say the
least, is disdainful, but that is not the point LaBute is trying to
make, nor does he use these talks solely for shock value.; The movie does have the nasty
habit of trying to be so coyly generic, in the special sense of ""this can
apply to anyone, anywhere,"" that it  can get counterproductive."
14603.0,Kuffs,1996.0,"So, for a very inventive film that is well worth going to see,
definitely don't miss this film.; It has come up with what is
probably the most hilarious use for subtitles in the movie industry.; All of
the actors in this film did a very good job.; KUFFS is a very inventive film.; It is worth $6.50, or whatever the
ticket price where you are.","Slater's worst film has been TWISTED (which I gave a three).; Tony Goldwyn is Slater's
short time partner and is basically around for comic relief so Slater
doesn't have to cover the entire film.; There was a total
of eight people in the theater, but those eight people seemed to have
enjoyed the film.; And is that fat cop Robbie
Cultrane?; It does have
its share of the laughs though."
14626.0,Beau travail,1996.0,"The
friendly feelings will surface, especially during card games, at
the lone dance hall, and especially in the quiet moments
when you're sharing a restful activity with your compatriots
such as ironing your clothes.; It's a film so visually
stunning and so magnificently palpable in its cinematography and in its
lively camera movements and fascinating narrative speculations, and most
of all, in its lyrical sensuality, that it runs poetically adrift with
its listless hypnotic pace, its sparse dialogue forcing the viewer to
see what is not being said, and by its strange brooding mood it sets, as
it tells in a matter of fact tone a story of hate, alienation and envy
through the eyes of the narrow-minded French Foreign legionnaire who
found freedom in his remorse.; There are many films
that influenced Denis, but the works of Alain Renais, especially his
Muriel, probably influenced her the most.; What
adds to the film, is the robust musical score of Benjamin Britten's
Billy Budd oratorio and the choreography staged by one of the actors who
played a legionnaire, Bernardo Montet.; The minimally told story is made
all the more powerful by many vivid shots, such as the one of the
emerald water contrasted with the barren desert, or of the distant
mountains which seem to have a language of their own that speaks to us
of things we cannot know, or of the unobtrusive native women in their
colorful dresses that we see in the marketplace or at the disco, who
strike a chord in us with their musical gestures and mocking tones.","I wonder if a male 
director would get away with shooting a female cast like that.; It feels unintentionally aimless, though, because 
there is a voice-over narration of grand musings that falsely suggests 
there's some higher meaning to it all.; The final scene, 
described above, feels tragic; the rest of the movie is quite boring.; The troops were almost always shirtless, and the
robotic manner at which they approached their tasks made parts of the
film seem like a commercial for The Gap.; I liken the film to fighting world featherweight champion
Prince Naseem  you laugh off Travail's near lack of dialogue,
indistinguishable characters, puny running time and paper-thin plot, but
before you know it, you're lying on your back with little birds floating
around your head."
14628.0,Fletch Lives,1995.0,"And, as in the original, Chase's disguises are simply amazing
and his impersonations brilliant.; Chase gives his
character that biting sarcasm and quick wit that made the first film so
much fun.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Ultimately, there's very little to recommend in FLETCH LIVES as the
movie fails to give us either sympathetic characters or sufficient laughs.; Unfortunately, Chase's efforts are sabotaged by the film's
incredibly uneven script and unnecessarily complicated story line.; FLETCH
LIVES also suffers from excess plot; the uncompelling story line should
have been merely an excuse for Fletch's irreverent impersonations and
wisecracks.; FLETCH LIVES pales in comparison to
the original; someone should have put this sequel out of its misery.; FLETCH LIVES is a disappointing sequel to the 1985 hit comedy
FLETCH, which was a surprisingly engaging Chevy Chase vehicle."
14629.0,Woman on Top,1992.0,"I enjoyed it all the way through.; The Arau film is more involving in its combination of
complex and numerous characters and a wonderfully lyrical mysticism that makes
the film so magical.; It was an easy watch, moved along
at a rapid pace and presented just enough mystical mumbo-jumbo for me to buy
into its fantastical elements.; The love story is sweet and the music,
especially Toninho's love songs, helps set the romantic mood.; Lots of traditional Brazilian music is provided, as performed by Murilo 
Benicio while rewooing his wife.","On the
other hand, Vera Blasi's flimsy plot goes beyond disbelief, needing
far too much voice-over narration.; It's not for lack of a talented cast, or good screenwriting, or even
smart directing, that this movie fails to charm.; It was an insult to one's intelligence.; With the burgeoning popularity
of the Food Network and charismatic chefs like Emeril Lagasse, the film
may have sounded like a good idea on paper, but in practice, Woman is
just bad filmmaking.; The picture is amateurish and uneven,
and its female lead has giant breasts and a tiny waist."
14662.0,Slums of Beverly Hills,1999.0,"Lyonne brings an intense honesty to her role,
and Tomei delivers an excellent performance as the dizzy Rita (even better
than her performance in My Cousin Vinny.); Alan Arkin reminds us
what a cinematic treasure he is, with a performance which is perfectly
nuanced and the right mix between stern and malleable.; Jenkins elicits strong performances from Lyonne and Tomei.; Tomei, who's been in a bit of a career slump as of late, shows
that she's still a great comic actress.; It touched
on all the nerves that made this into an intense dramatic scene, that
worked so well because the script was tight and the actors were
well-cast, with especially Natasha Lyonne, as the girl who was always
being surprised as she tries to find out who she is.","The other
very bad scene involves a brief display of inappropriate conduct (that's
inappropriate in the Bill Clinton sense) between Murray and Rita.; Ms. Jenkins developed her script at the
Sundance Institute - hence Robert Redford's name as executive producer
- but her quirky humor is quite heavy-handed and she needs to learn
how to do some judicious editing.; But that's hardly the only good thing about this film.; It's as if the film would be the same if it just had someone
enter the scene holding a sign that said ""Now here's the dramatic part of
the film.""; A
series of scenes at an airport lack the irony and material to really
succeed."
14805.0,Bait,1998.0,"Is it a brilliant 
mix of the two like James Cameron's ""True Lies""?; Foxx plays a good-natured,
small-time thief on parole who, as the story begins, is caught
stealing prawns from a Brooklyn restaurant with his brother (Mike
Epps).; Yes, this film definitely has elements from both flicks!; He's also the man behind Coolio's ""Gangsta's Paradise"" music
video, as well as Prince's ""The Most Beautiful Girl in the World"".; ""You don't want to know,"" he replies.","This is a review I don't 
even want to write because I'd just be laying the same criticisms on it that 
I would with any other so-generic-and-predictable-it's-beyond-ridiculous 
piece of Hollywood fluff.; It's not entirely his fault, he 
does get some pretty lousy dialogue, but he also shamelessly overacts for 
the entire first half of the film.; It's a shame a good star, a good director, and a promising cinematographer 
are wasted on this script.; It's genuinely unfunny (I, and the other audience members only laughed 
ONCE during the entire two hours), unoriginal and unthrilling.; The problem with BAIT is that editing out these flaws 
wouldn't have left enough to make even the trailers."
14817.0,Good Burger,1999.0,"Well, for once the previews worked AGAINST the
film, as ""Good Burger"" is surprisingly very funny.; I did like Shaq, who does a great job just being
himself.; If that comment sounded a little farcical, then you'll have to forgive
me - but Good Burger deserves it entirely.; And aside for a little bit of minor league
profanity, it's a fine film for the family.; But I've still been able to look back and laugh in disbelief - at those
good memories that were actually nightmares to experience at the time.","What a waste of $7.50!!!).; With
the world's worst Afro hair and outfits with sequined, foot long
lapels, Mr.; The target audience for this film appears to be 13-15 year olds.; He's doing a sort of James Brown impression for the whole film, and it's
awfully annoying.; The previews seemed to be all I needed to see to judge that this
just wasn't worth my time."
14904.0,Proof,1995.0,"It is perfect.; It may be the best film you see this year.; The story is also funny, surprising, even shocking in a quiet
way.; The answer is rife with dramatic possibilities and
compelling implications about human nature, about truth, about trust.; In
the absence of vision, he seeks absolute truth, but trusts no one to
describe his photos to him until he meets Andy, played by Russell Crowe,
who has the time and ability to describe Martin's photos in 10 words or
less.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
14905.0,Welcome To Sarajevo,1964.0,"But it's a
       persistent little film, and it sticks with you.; Winterbottom and Boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters
covering the atrocities.; This portrayal is much more flattering to reporters
than earlier Wafflemovies.com selection Mad City.; His job is to get the best stories, the
best pictures, for the media's viewers, readers back home.; This film offers an honest portrait of the media in action, as it also
depicts a public that is more interested in being entertained than being
informed.","It just seems as though the film is uneven to the point 
of disappointment.; Combine this with Frank Cottrell
Boyce's incoherent and confusing script of Michael Nicholson's book
""Natasha's Story,"" and the result is chaos.; Stephen Dillane, whose last film, TWO IF BY SEA, made my worst
movie of the year list last year, gives a wooden performance in the
staring role of Michael.; All of this
notwithstanding, WELCOME TO SARAJEVO is a frustrating and tedious film
to watch and does at best a mediocre job of telling their story.; Rated R.  Running Time: 100 minutes."
14908.0,McHale's Navy,1999.0,"Commander Quinton McHale isn't the kind of figure people 
recall with great fondness when looking back on old sit-coms.; BILKO and DOWN PERISCOPE as the best arguments
yet for military down-sizing, trotting out the same tired cliches --
unorthodox heroes, inept commanding officers, officious little weasels
getting trampled by the zany crew -- which haven't been funny
since...well, ever.; From that 
point on, it's all by the book as McHale re-enlists, reunites his crew, 
and goes to war with Vladikov.; The movie's
flowing along, light-hearted, breezy, ready for comedy.; There are some impressive performances, particularly
by Benjamin Bratt as the wild and troubled Abel, and writer/director Peter
Bratt constantly keeps the audience off-balance with a surreal, dream-like
atmosphere and characters who are never as predictable as you think they
might be.","Either Campbell is completely happy with
working only bit parts in small movies, he has the worst agent in the world,
or he's unbelievably difficult to work with.; The dearth of intelligence makes this 
film as painful to sit through as any of 1997's other worst offenders, 
and I wonder why more people didn't walk out of the screening I 
attended.; But he's eighth or ninth billing and given
absolutely nothing to do.; His old crew, your stereotypical bunch of
losers and misfits (honestly, how do people like this even make it INTO the
military?); These deaths are supposed to be funny."
14924.0,Sid and Nancy,1997.0,"More to the point, Gary Oldman *is* Sid Vicious
(or the closest we can hope to see since Sid's death).; A bit
later, we see Sid and friends walking along the street.; Gary Oldman plays Sid.; (And, don't
forget, this is SID AND NANCY, not SID AND NANCY AND JOHN AND MALCOLM.; SID AND NANCY is a very slick movie
about a very dirty, grimy subject.","Neither
actor looks or acts like the person he portrays.; The actor (whose name escapes me) doesn't quite manage to
capture Johnny Rotten (except for the singing voice).; When I heard that a film was being made about Sid Vicious and Nancy
Spungen, I figured, ""Well, I guess it was inevitable that someone would wind up
doing a Sex Pistols retrospective.; :-) ) [Moderator's note: Do not confuse the D.O.A.; John Lydon's character seems to have been cast for the
singing voice alone."
15037.0,Can't Hardly Wait,1995.0,"Also, the soundtrack of
this film really blew me away with its eclectic mix of heavy rock, rap
and punk, and any film that has the balls to feature Guns 'n Roses
""Paradise City"" as one of its flagship tunes (During one of the best
scenes in the film) is allright in my book!; I've seen The Breakfast Club, and I
think it's a pretty good film.; I thoroughly enjoyed
myself through this film, for not only is it a smart and funny movie,
but it captures the essence of high school perfectly.; This thread is sweet yet raucous, and often very funny,
which is the mix Kaplan and Elfont obviously strived for in their other
storylines.; Far more involving--and upstaging the central action--is a subplot
following the unlikely but inevitable romance between Preston's acerbic
best friend Denise (the delightful Lauren Ambrose) and Ebonics-spouting
white boy Kenny (a hilarious Seth Green), who find themselves locked in a
bathroom together.","Unfortunately, beyond broad stereotypes and patently obvious
social observations, Can't Hardly Wait has very little to offer.; It's just too bad the far more successful ""Clueless"" beat it to
the punch three summers ago.Copyright 1998 Jamie Peck

""Joe's Apartment' would be a very bad comedy even without the roaches, but
it would not be a disgusting one.; I couldn't stand any of those characters.; I mean, the
characters are all merely caricatures, and the prolonged introduction
only serves to point out their shallowness.; The film's setup is tedious at best, and much too lengthy."
15104.0,Tortilla Soup,1970.0,"Susan Granger's review of ""TORTILLA SOUP"" (Samuel Goldwyn Films) Based on the Taiwanese film ""Eat Drink Man Woman,"" this is a savory
romantic comedy about the power of love and food in a middle-class
Mexican-American family in Los Angeles.; Hector Elizondo, who has
been in eighty-five film and TV productions, stands out for his
ability to coax a thoroughly natural performance as patriarch
who is never really as stern as his girls make him out to be
and who must learn to hang loose and acquire some taste.; ""We have good manners
and good conversation.""; ""Tortilla Soup"" is a family drama that's just made for
ensemble acting, and we are not disappointed by any of the
group who play so well together.; The film opens nationwide in the United States today, August 24, 2001.","A more substantial problem is Xavier Pérez Grobet's grainy cinematography.; If this film were in IMAX 3-D you'd have the
added frustration of putting the gourmet morsels into your
mouth without tasting a thing.; It is rated PG-13 for ""sexual content""
and would be acceptable for kids around 10 and up.; When they're not feasting (their meals for four look like royal banquets for
twelve), the women bicker with each other.; Raquel Welch,
as the father's new girlfriend, can't keep up with the others' acting abilities."
15170.0,Buddy,2000.0,"It is precisely because the film was able to morph into a more
serious film that hooked me.; My son Jeffrey, age 8, liked the movie,
but was very scared in a few of the scenes.; Based on a true
story of an eccentric but loving woman who kept a menagerie in her
mansion, the film takes some surprising twists.; Throughout most of BUDDY, the story is a wonderful and magical
adventure into the animal kingdom, but parents with impressionable
children must be forewarned that the movie turns tragically sad and
quite frightening before it ultimately ends on an upbeat note.; BUDDY is loosely based on a true story (although it takes 
considerable liberties with the facts).","Other-
wise, you'll probably end up as I did, feeling like a caged animal after
a mere twenty minutes.; Unfortunately, this movie is 
an unremarkable example of film making, and doesn't distinguish itself 
in the way that recent family features like BABE and SHILOH have.; Actually, had the movie concentrated more 
on this aspect of the story rather than expending so much time and 
effort being ""cute,"" it might have been more gripping.; Buddy
possesses tremendous charm, most of all when he is a baby even if that
is the least convincing of the special effects.; Buddy escapes and wreaks havoc, but the movie passes 
quickly through this critical juncture, failing to exploit opportunities 
to fashion a narrative of greater scope and depth."
15196.0,Clue,1999.0,"or 
http://us.imdb.com/ReviewsBy?John+Beachem * * * * * - One of the best movies of the year.; While not as witty as Neil Simon's Murder By Death, Clue definitely has
it moments.; Clue is available on DVD from Paramount Home Video.; THEY HAVE
ALWAYS SUCKED, THEY WILL ALWAYS SUCK, BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE ALONG COMES
A GREAT MOVIE THAT GIVES US HOPE TO CONTINUE.; The 
other cast members display great comic abilities, but two stick out in my 
mind as turning in really memorable performances.","So if ""Clue"" fails as 
a mystery, why did I give it a four star rating?; For two, it has a script with dialogue that jumps off the page.; * * - Pretty bad, see it at your own risk.; As a mystery film, director Jonathan Lynn's 
(""The Whole Nine Yards"") ""Clue"" fails miserably.; Okay, how can a movie called ""Clue"" fail as a mystery?"
15198.0,"Mystery, Alaska",1994.0,"Unlike most movies that come highly recommended while seeming incredibly
mainstream, Mystery, Alaska did not disappoint me.; Hollywood being the business
of illusions, and the best illusions being the most realistic looking,
Mystery, Alaska does a very good job.; The game is entertaining
and the players are an enjoyable lot.; What makes and made these shows so 
good?; Both are delightful, no-holds-barred comedic masterpieces, always
reveling in their own outrageousness.","Mystery, Alaska could have done far worse
for a role model.; Revision: it seemed like a terrible idea.; The first sixty minutes, which set up the
unlikely premise of the New York Rangers flying to a nowhere
nothing-town in the middle of the Alaskan winter to play a game of pond
hockey, is one of the worst hours of film I've seen all year.; The rest of the
half-dozen or so plot threads in MYSTERY, ALASKA are just plain
inexcusable.; Any potential for a rousing conclusion is
lost in memories of the preceding two hours, with its two typically
bombastic Kelley courtroom scenes, tedious pacing and undisciplined
script."
15300.0,Newsies,2000.0,"But especially stunning are the mattes, especially one of the Brooklyn
Bridge that so amazing that it gets its own credit.; The music is excellent.; This is one film that I recommend that you definitely don't miss.; NEWSIES is a very good film in the grand Disney film tradition.; I am saying it's pretty darn good and
better than anything that's come along in a long while in this genre.","Instead
it sounds like he is certifiably insane.; Of course, even Duvall can only do so much with a script
that largely reduces Pulitzer to two-dimensional villain.; If I had seen a preview of a Broadway show instead of a movie, I
would be cautiously optimistic.; But since it is a movie it is too late to make any
changes, and we are left with an interesting failure.; No emotion is expressed other
than a pseudo-excitement."
15321.0,Twin Town,1996.0,"They a little bit poorer than TRAINSPOTTING's Mark 
Renton, but a little bit crazier, so it works out even.; Cast: Llyr Evans, Rhys Ifans, William Thomas, Dorien Thomas, 
      Dougray Scott, Huw Ceredig, Rachel Scorgie, Di Botcher, 
      Mary Allen, Brian Hibbard, Jenny Evans
Director: Kevin Allen
Producer: Peter McAleese
Screenplay: Kevin Allen & Paul Durden
Cinematography: John Mathieson
Music: Mark Thomas
U.S.; TWIN TOWN is the story of two brothers: Julian and Jeremy Lewis (Llyrs 
Ifans and Rhys Evans), who aren't twins but are thought to be by just 
about everyone.; TWIN TOWN is considerably funnier 
than TRAINSPOTTING, but not as powerful -- not by a longshot.; We've seen it all before; it's time to offer a new twist.","In fact, the 
term ""boring"" wouldn't be out of place as a descriptor of the endless 
first half.; The plot -- or 
what passes for one -- is pointless and occasionally muddled (especially 
near the beginning).; That's because, at least early on, TWIN TOWN is just about 
a bunch of off-putting, undeveloped characters doing a variety of dodgy 
things.; Allen's movie, which takes place in Swansea, Wales (called, 
appropriately enough, ""the graveyard of ambition"" by Dylan Thomas), 
introduces us to a cast of characters who could have been lifted out of 
a bad MONTY PYTHON sketch (one of those where you wonder how such a 
talented troupe could come up with something so unfunny).; Outlandishness for its own sake isn't 
interesting, just as a film's status as a ""black comedy"" doesn't excuse 
its multitude of flaws."
15489.0,Snow Day,1999.0,"Strong music wisps with the magic of ""E.T.""; A few endearingly unique
moments grace this tale, but for the most part, it evolves just as expected.; Whether you live in the tundra or not, I'm sure everyone can relate to
the real story of SNOW DAY, the tale of a boy who pines for the school
beauty, a girl far above his station with whom he never has a shot.; Produced by Julia Pistor, Albie Hecht at Paramount/Nickelodeon.; When a record snowfall hits upstate New York, each character is affected
in ways that will forever change the way they approach life.","One basic problem is the movie is unsure to which audience its wants to
pander, the younger kids or teen-agers.; Showing youngsters driving around in heavy
machinery is not my idea of a smart move.; Only I don't know which is worse: the kids or
their trying-to-be-hip, mouth-breathing parents.; When all is said and done, ""Snow Day"" fails because it is so resolutely 
uneven.; Luckily, Chase is only involved in one of the four prongs of Day's
script."
15556.0,At First Sight,1995.0,"At first
glance, AT FIRST SIGHT is a throwback love story, short on world-changing
ramifications but long on gorgeous photography and superb chemistry
between Sorvino and Kilmer.; The wonderful Nathan Lane injects some humour as the
irreverent Phil Webster, a visual therapist who helps Virgil cope with
understanding this brave new world of sight.; Kilmer's realistic
performance especially reveals emotional depths that he hasn't tapped
into very often.; The extremely subtle and
wonderfully crafted story of 'At First Sight' is no classic but takes
the idea of human sight, and how we all (whether we want to admit it or
not) take it for granted and how painful it would be to adjust to a
world of darkness.; The massaging sequences were strangely erotic, maybe even 
 more so than the later actual ""love scenes,"" and as their romantic 
 involvement quickly developed, the film was both entertaining and sweet, 
 and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two.","It's just a
disappointing one.; She is incredibly dull and unconvincing.; Overall the film tries hard but, and I know I'm contradicting myself here,
Kilmer just isn't right for the part, Sorvino is simply wasted to bits and
the whole thing could have been so much more but for the awful directing
skills of Irwin Winkler.; Her bland character is simply
unappealing.; Any scene he is in shakes 
the credibility of the entire film."
15602.0,Grumpier Old Men,1999.0,"Although this is not the most romantic way to court a woman, it is
certainly one of the more inventive.; While this may not be the final on-screen teaming of ""putz"" Lemmon 
and ""moron"" Matthau, hopefully this is the last time we'll see them as 
John and Max.; Jack Lemmon can still immobilize us with the sadness in his
eyes; Matthau can still massage a line with his furrowed brow.; He gets ""jewelry"" for Loren and in what struck 
me as the movie's funniest bit, explains: ""It's a cubic 
zirconium.; Now, two years later, John Gustafson (Lemmon) and best enemy 
Max Goldman (Matthau) are back at it again.","Unfortunately, 
the competition for this honor is pretty feeble.; It's painful to watch all this talent trying so hard to make
something of nothing.; Whatever magic GRUMPY possessed, 
GRUMPIER lacks.; Although the collective talents of this cast could sustain any
major comedy, their combined efforts can't hoist this one beyond
boredom.; Ann-Margret (age 54 in 1995) and the rest of the cast strictly 
provide support, padding or decoration."
15660.0,Mommie Dearest,1998.0,"Great films distinguished by
great performances, and a far more eloquent testament to this great
woman than Frank Perry's shrieking piece of tabloid froth.; When
the adult Christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling,
Joan visits and keeps in touch, not helping her financially but
encouraging Christina's own acting and career ambitions.; Based on the first, and
best, revenge book, by her daughter, Christina, it is one of the
trashiest films ever made, and also a lot of not-so-innocent fun.; And what a delicious piece of
campery it often is.; And
later, when the Board of her late husband's company Pepsi Cola tries
to divest her of her directorship, she displays a superb grasp of
business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring: ""Don't fuck
with me, fellas!!"".","The film's version of Crawford is a sort of cross
between Baby Jane and Countess Dracula, which does nothing for
verisimilitude, but does make it very watchable.; The script - laboured over by four writers, a bad
sign in itself  - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds
little dramatic momentum.; No, the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of
screen queen Joan Crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the
year.; Oh dear!; Unfortunately, Faye Dunaway's energetic, at times ridiculously
over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature."
15668.0,Xanadu,1993.0,"But taken for what it is -- an unapologetic wallow in the glitz
and gloss of the late 1970s -- ""Xanadu"" is actually a lot of fun.; It's a hilarious and effective argument for open-mindedness.; Naive as it may
sound, that kind of message is genuinely refreshing to hear these days.; But Newton-John and Kelly are thoroughly
charming, the music (including Newton-John's huge hit ""Magic"" and the
lilting ""Suddenly"") is intoxicating, the production design is out of
this world and the costumes are, well, very much a product of their
time.; As a movie, its merits are debatable, but as a relic of a long-gone era,
""Xanadu"" is priceless.","Ridiculous?; But time has been oddly kind to this much-maligned movie.; It's
doubtful, however, that Kubla Khan's 'stately pleasure dome' had much in
common with this place, where spandex-clad vixens, guys with
over-moussed hair and other fashion victims get down to the sounds of
the Electric Light Orchestra.; After
all, it's difficult to hate a picture that tries so desperately hard to
dazzle.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
15730.0,Love & Human Remains,,"With snappy one-liners and perfectly-timed 
longer sequences, the film is ripe with hilarious moments.; Thomas
Gibson has all the best lines, dryly expressing his cynicism better than I
could ever hope to do.; Like Clint Eastwood, he's a true ""man's man"".; The dangers of getting AIDS is one of the major undercurrents flowing through 
the film, with both David and Candy very cautious about getting it.; Following the interactions of seven side-wardly mobile Canadians,
LOVE AND HUMAN REMAINS explores questions of love, misery, loneliness,
confusion, and the strange truth that all seem to be inexplicably present
at the same time.","Too bad for Candy, then, since 
she realizes at this point that the whole thing was an awful mistake, since 
she now knows she isn't gay.; Brad 
Fraser's script (which he adapted from his off-Broadway play) is 
completely unconvincing when it comes to developing love or sex-based 
relationships (the platonic friendships are just fine).; Its success is 
sporadic at best, but, too often, the film completely misses the mark.; Numerous red herrings highlight amateurish attempts to keep 
the audience guessing at the killer's identity.; 1995 - 99 minutes
Rated R (for violence, sexual situations, nudity, profanity, and drug use)."
15745.0,Made,1995.0,"_Swingers_ is more a movie of moments while _Made_ is
more about the larger picture--a picture that may not end up with the
fervent following of its flashier predecessor, but one that is definitely
worth a look.; Anyone enamored with the unique and hip sensibility of Swingers will
find Made almost as much fun.; Largely
unpredictable and decidedly uncommercial despite its easy-to-
take comic overtones, ""Made"" casts a dark shadow over the
two people whose friendship is not often a perfect blendship.; The constrast in styles and the chemistry between Favreau and Vaughn is what
makes Made so enjoyable to watch.; Sean Combs is surprisingly natural as Ruiz, smooth and
intimidating, but not too intimidating.","""Made"" tries to be a number of different things and, unfortunately, doesn't
do any of them well.; Rated R. 94 minutes.; You wouldn't expect much symbolism in a comic romp once
again teaming ""Swingers"" thesps Jon Favreau with Vince
Vaughn, but in one scene a goldfish bowl turns over, the poor
fish tossing miserably on the floor.; Favreau, who wrote the bright script for SWINGERS,
writes and directs the surprisingly mediocre MADE.; While the sharp dialogue that made his ""Swingers"" script such a success
can be found in Bobby and Ricky's banter, the writer/director's story stumbles
for lack of character background."
15752.0,Barenaked in America,2001.0,"The Ladies are presented by
Priestley as a group of nice, intelligent guys having loads of fun
entertaining their fans, almost completely unfazed by their sudden
notoriety in America.; Few
popular music acts of the day would make better subjects for a
straight-ahead concert film; the Ladies, as their manager notes in an
interview, are pure entertainers whose shows are singular experiences.; That's the Barenaked 
experience that should be recorded for posterity.; Great stuff for a People magazine profile; not so
much for a feature documentary.; As the film begins, ""One
Week"" has already become a hit, Hearn has already been diagnosed and the
high-profile tour is already underway.","MPAA Rating:  Unrated (could be PG-13 for brief nudity, profanity)
Running Time:  89 minutes.; Director:  Jason Priestley.; I say this as a longtime fan of Barenaked Ladies, someone who was
listening to their music years before they became an arena act: There was
no good reason for Jason Priestley to make a documentary about the band,
at least not the documentary he made.; That, unfortunately, is what prevents BARENAKED IN AMERICA from being
a particularly interesting film experience.; Far more often, he simply turns on his camera like a buddy of the
band making a home movie."
15765.0,What's Love Got to Do with It,1996.0,"These are frighteningly intense and starkly graphic,

physical abuse suffered by one of our most beloved female

the acting and the style gave the film a feel of authenticity, the film

Turner fan.; But somehow her appearance keeps her from transforming
into her character the way Denzel Washington transformed into Malcolm X on
the screen.; I am sure Ike Turner was this bad from
Tina's point of view, and I am sure Tina was a good person from her own
point of view.; Going into the movie, I have to admit that I wasn't optimistic."

Seymour Hoffman (The Big Lebowski).; Some of them, like the always reliable
Joan Allen, fare better than others.; Rage also
features characters played by André Braugher (Frequency), David
Schwimmer (Friends) and Giovanni Ribisi (Gone in 60 Seconds), and all of

disturbing, and even its eclectic A-list cast can't save it from being
yet another bad Pulp Fiction rip-off.; While the acting in Rage isn't too bad, the script seems particularly
hackneyed.; We the audience are stuck with ninety
minutes of angry one-note characters who rub their quirkiness in our
faces.; The budget shows its seams painfully in poorly lit
flat imagery, often cheating shots to avoid showing the entire house of
a millionaire or upper middle class couple in ways which limit the film
visually.; I can't think
of anything much worse than a film that thinks it's edgy and quirky but
just plain isn't."
16075.0,Great Expectations,1994.0,"Great Expectations is a wonderful film with grand performances and a
stunning look.; Although Great Expectations may not be the most satisfying cinema
experience, it has more than enough bones in it's body to make it an
enjoyable feast of Generation X gibberish.; The movie is a visual banquet thanks to Emmanuel Lubezki's sexy 
cinematography; notably, he captures a revisited fountain kiss between 
the two leads with a luscious, erotic charge that's steamier than the 
film's (surprisingly muted) love scenes.; Nevertheless, while Alfonso Cuaron's GREAT 
EXPECTATIONS falls considerably short of being a definitive 
interpretation of the novel, it still offers an entertaining two hours.; Sure - it's far from
perfect, but perfection isn't the name of the game - the film has a
sugary sweetness buried deep inside, which is eventually discovered
and appreciated.","And poor Ethan...he's saddled with the tough job of playing the boring
protagonist while all around him are interesting characters.; It basically succeeds as an artsy film, making a appealing version of the
classic, but the re-naming of the characters, the choppy dialogue and the
write-your-script-in-a-three-day-weekend contest winner script make a
complete lack of appeal.; The worst kind of woman in my book, the type that
knows they're gorgeous, uses it, and then dumps all over you when you
show the least bit of interest.; The result is a disappointing film which is neither romantic nor poignant,
but instead feels like Cliffs Notes on acid.; The problem is not that it
doesn't follow the book (which it doesn't), but that it instead tries to
tell a melodramatic story about people we barely care about if they weren't
being portrayed by such cool actors."
16110.0,Thomas and the Magic Railroad,2000.0,"He liked the story, especially the part with the new engine named Lady.; To begin, some background information: ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" was a strange 
and wonderful British TV show for children, first broadcast when I was 
growing up in the 1980s, and still popular today.; The
issues are unambiguously black and white (Paul is the perfect boy and
his roommates and the professor are perfect assholes), which is highly
unlikely in any real relationship scenario.; In addition to Thomas (""the really useful engine""),
each of the others (Gordon, Percy, Henry, etc) has a unique personality,
and although they may bicker a lot, they are all good engines at heart,
except for a mean one called Diesel.; It was innocent fantasy, complete with a great 
theme tune, and narration by Ringo Starr.","Baldwin is the most embarrassing -- wandering around on his own, attempting 
to breathe excitement into nothing in particular, talking as if to an 
imaginary friend.; Her young friend, played by
Cody McMains, is worse, and the stiff dialogue doesn't help matters.; It's just that all of
this is mired in a clunky set of hole-filled plots, confusing enough to
make me want to interrogate the little guy sitting in front of me.; /Loser/ is a rental for a romantic evening, but
only if the video store clerk can't ""aide"" you in finding something
better.; ""Thomas and the Magic Railroad"" is 
nonsensical, cheesy, saccharine drivel, with all the charm of its source 
material removed, and the low-tech special effects kept in."
16148.0,Zero Effect,1999.0,"The story is an intriguing one, filled with twists and
reversals and a surprise ending which will catch you unaware.; Ben Stiller is also a very funny individual; he's the kind of comedian
who makes normal lines sound funny.; In becoming
the best P.I.; In
fact, some of the best scenes are Ben Stiller's wonderfully underplayed
comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer.; But a touching love story and one man's plight into beginning to understand
the emotions of other people is something that I sure wasn't expecting,
what with the opening promising another quirky thriller a la ""Grosse Pointe
Blank,"" but that I was all the more happier to allow happen.","There were some original
points in the script, and even some clever moments about the detective,
his methods and motivations, but not enough to constitute anything
close to a successful movie.; Just in case there's any confusion, let me state at the outset that 
there's no doubt that writer/director Jake Kasdan (son of Lawrence) 
intended this to be an homage to (that sounds so much nicer than ""rip 
off of"") Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous fictitious detective.; Rated R. 
Running Time: 112 minutes.; The scene in Zero's quarters that features the
detective strumming wildly on his guitar while standing on his
mattress is almost an embarrassment.; Also, the film feels like it's a black
comedy, but instead it comes across as merely quirky."
16161.0,Baby Boy,1995.0,"And driven by a strong soundtrack, BABY BOY provides unique
delights all its own.; And unlike the
caricaturized roles in Boyz, he's created very complex characters that
are more believably flawed.; The ever-great Ving Rhames is powerful as the bullish Melvin who
turns out to have a lot to offer Jody once Jody lets him.; ""Baby Boy"" is not a great movie, and lacks the overall realism and intensity 
of ""Boyz N the Hood,"" but it is a good one.; Their moments of tenderness, and the chemistry between
Gibson and Henson, convince that these two people genuinely love and care
for each other.","Baby Boy is poorly written, poorly
directed, poorly acted and, worst of all, has the audacity to carry on for
over two hours.; Uh
oh...; With not much new to add to the genre, one is
left to wonder why Singleton has repeated himself (aside from obvious
financial gains.; ""Ludicrous!; Boy rambles on and on, with no rhythm and virtually no purpose (Jody does
eventually get a job...selling boosted women's clothes), other than to show
what is supposed to be the transition of a cocky boy into a real man."
16172.0,Simply Irresistible,1980.0,"Simply Irresistible is not only an extraordinary romantic film, but it 
is an incredibly entertaining, fun, and flat out enjoyable movie as 
well.; Overall, Simply Irresistible is a wonderful film.; It is
charming, magical, enjoyable and, yes, irresistible.; Simply Irrisistible is a surprisingly
enjoyable picture with a kind-hearted temperament and a sweet,
sentimental aftertaste.; The likeable cast deliver delightful performances.","Gellar and
Flannery are qualified actors, and Gellar has a particular charm, but I
much prefer her playing the saucy Buffy (or even Annette in the upcoming
""Cruel Intentions"") than this sorry excuse for a character.; Does it have anything to do 
with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen 
somehow assisting her in her food preparation?; This clumsy comedy fails on almost all fronts, and here's why.; This setup plays about as dreadful as it sounds, with only the appeal and
chemistry of Gellar and Flanery keeping it watchable.; Some places the plot
just doesn't make sense, sometimes it's way too contrived (the crab bit,
for example), and sometimes too corny (Peaches emitting dry ice."
16179.0,Breathing Room,1998.0,"Susan Floyd and Dan Futterman (Robin Williams' son in THE 
BIRDCAGE), both stage actors, do the best they can with the material, 
but it's a thankless job.; In 
the two years since they first met, they've broken up and gotten back 
together five times.; In keeping with this statement, 
Sherman's film gives us an idealized vision of the United States' 
largest city.; He's a 
layabout who can't stand ""real"" jobs and appreciates spontaneity.; She's a 
career-oriented woman who likes to have an ordered life.","Alas, 
most of the supposedly clever dialogue turns out to be trite, and the 
characters are neither endearing nor particularly interesting.; It's 
artificial and clunky.; With the exception of a couple of 
nicely-crafted scenes, their feelings come across as shallow and 
insincere.; BREATHING ROOM's deep-rooted flaws have their 
origins in the script, and even the best actors couldn't have saved this 
project (although, admittedly, a little more chemistry might have made 
it seem less cold and remote).; As romantic comedies go, BREATHING ROOM 
is a sad and unappealing affair, and extremely unlikely to evoke the 
warm glow that even the most modest entry into the genre strives for."
16219.0,Gladiator,1993.0,"Still, my admiration is
quite strong for this gorgeous, savage, terrifically acted film.; Crowe is also excellent as the film's grisly-faced
hero.; Jane) unique visual stamp  from the colorless studio logos for
Dreamworks and Universal at the beginning, to the startling, dream-like
ending  has crafted a real winner, firmly establishing Gladiator as
2000's first genuine blockbuster.; The biggest surprise is Phoenix, who
turns in a respectably strong performance as the picture-perfect,
sneering antagonist.; His cause is personal  a bit too personal
for a story of such grand scale.","Those expository scenes are akin to (sorry to bring up Lucas's steaming pile
of celluloid waste, but I must for I am far too lazy to think of a better
example) the political trial scenes in STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE, which
virtually everyone will agree were dramatically inert, passionless, and, well,
boring.; Which
isn't to say that it looks bad, it just doesn't look authentic.; With GLADIATOR it's obvious
that Scott really wanted to make an important film rather than an exploitive
action yarn like CONAN, though his expository scenes are dull and lacking in
the charge of his spastic action sequences.; Gladiator doesn't come across as a dissection of Roman politics, nor
does it particularly pander to the blood thirsty voyeurs lurking in its
audience looking for cheap thrills.; I noticed that the portly critic seemed to be
all up in arms about historical inaccuracies, none of which (to show how awful
I was in History) I even noticed."
16222.0,Whatever It Takes,2000.0,"Shane West of  ""Once and Again"" plays a nerdy, sensitive Gilmore High School senior who lends his poetic ability to the hunky jock - that's James Franco (""Freaks and Geeks"") - who's smitten with West's next-door neighbor, Marla Sokoloff (""The Practice"").; Although it has
all of the requisite bathroom humor and underage drinking that I'm sorry
to say that many teens want in their movies, it also has some good
messages about the consequences of your actions and has some likable
leads.; The theme of the dance this time is ""Titanic Dreams.""; In order for both to get what they
want, the guys tell each other what to say.; Ryan views Maggie as the functional equivalent of the sister he never
had.","Screenwriter Mark Schwahn updates ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" in this stereotypical teenybopper comedy that's so stupid, crass, even misogynistic, that it's insulting to the vulnerable audience for whom it's intended.; The movie tries to make you believe
that he only has the former.; And, for his cast, director David Raynr has recruited TV stars whose generic personas can barely fill the big screen.; So does the movie end in a prom?; The only attempt at cleverness comes when the accordion-playing West does a riff on Tom Cruise's ""Risky Business"" lip-sync, dressed in boxer shorts and a cowboy hat."
16236.0,Mansfield Park,1999.0,"O'Connor is superb and suffuses her character with
plenty of fierce determination and spunk.; The characters are beautifully brought to life by the
wonderful cast.; It may not be what Austen intended, but it
is still enjoyable.; This is a witty, articulate and beautifully observed
tale that retains the lyrical quality of Austen's prose as well as the
irony with which she observed the social mores and conventions of
British society during the late 18th and early 19th century.; The movie features one of the best casts in the Austen movie series:
O'Connor is very good, Miller just as good, and Harold Pinter (he can
act, too) does well in the revised, over-politicized role of Sir Thomas
Bertram.","The only weak link
in the cast (and of course, a chain is only as strong as its weakest
link) is Alessandro Nivola whose Henry is dull and standard,
undermining the dilemma at the heart of the movie: from Nivola's
portrayal it isn't difficult to see why Fanny never went ga-ga over the
guy.; Then there are the claims regarding Rozema's sex scenes -- which are 
ridiculous, because no such moments exist!; Try Juno for FREE -- then it's just $9.95/month if you act NOW!; _Mansfield_Park_ (PG-13) *** 1/2 (out of ****) Writer-director Patricia Rozema has received some heat for taking more
than a few liberties in adapting Jane Austen's third novel, which is
about a poor young woman named Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor as an adult)
who is shipped off to live with her wealthy aunt (Lindsay Duncan) and
uncle (Harold Pinter) in Mansfield Park.; The premise  a young girl uprooted from her impoverished family to live
with wealthy relatives - sounds like a bad Cinderella knock-off."
16281.0,Creepshow,1992.0,"The fourth segment, 'The Crate'
is great.; However, the last two segments are the best.; However, well not really acheiving a
high level of greatness, this film is still just enough fun to past the time.; The film is done as a comic book (the comic called 'Creepshow') and takes
five of the animated stories and turns them into real life.; A college professor has an annoying wife, and guess what he does
to her...I found this segment great, and it also has the best comedy.","Under the stairs of a college is a big crate, with a monster
living it.; So he sitting
in his house, looking rather smug, and should raise from the dead, looking
rather wet (and some great makeup from Tom Savini)?; The second story stars Stephen King, as an unlucky bumpkin who discovers a
meteror that turns everything into vegetation (including King) Now, although
King can write (so some people say) he most defefently CAN'T act (and
direct, as shown with MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE) And anyway, this segment just isn't
very good.; It involves some dead guy rising from his
grave, searching for a cake which he never got.; (Instead, he got the rather
pleasent gift of a marble ash tray smashing into his tray) Of course, the
person who smashed the ash tray into his head meets a sticky end."
16327.0,Hercules Returns,1992.0,"It's well worth your $6.50.; Sent by Zeus to the
Pink Parthenon nightclub in Climidia, he is forced to take on fellow
iron pumper Samson (now a wimp who cries at the thought of violence).; Now director David Parker and producer Philip Jaroslow brings the
""Double Take"" team to the movies with HERCULES RETURNS.; The provides a good laugh, and does so in a refreshing and

----------------------
     Frustrated by the uncaring style of his megalith employer, the
Kent Cinema Corporation, film buff Brad McBain decides to take on the
big boys by opening his own old style cinema.; Multiple punch-ups ensue, along with much damage to paper mache
columns, and poor Hercules' sexuality is deeply challenged along the
way.... Brad's ex-employer and would-be nemesis Kent, on seeing the
audience in an uproar of approval, is now even more determined to undo
his upstart competitor.; Problematically, Labia seems more romantically entangled with
Testiculi."
16370.0,Aspen Extreme,1993.0,"Although none of the principles are great performers, they're likable

worth the price of admission just to see such photography.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Together with his best friend Dexter (Peter Berg), he heads
off to Aspen, Colorado to become a ski instructor.; Without a doubt, the most impressive thing about ASPEN EXTREME is
its cinematography.","For this, his
first effort, he might have had some success trying for a comedy instead
of a drama.; That would be the only reason to see the movie, however.; In the end, ASPEN EXTREME is a predictable, pointless melodrama--a
kind of TOP GUN in the snow.; Aside from being fragmented (it's difficult to tell how much time
has passed at any given point during the film--the seasons change, but
it's unclear how quickly), the plot is flat and unoriginal.; It does
not possess an abundance of redeeming qualities."

touching story to you and give it ***.; Even she can't force Taplitz to decide
whose story this is, or what we should have learned about dealing with the
struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite.; Anthony LaPaglia, on 
the other hand, does a good job in the thankless role as the grim 
unbeliever (who also happens to be the narrator).; Many weeks later, he gets a message of sorts when a tornado strikes his
brownstone but leaves all of the other homes in the neighborhood
unharmed.; The show builds to its chief conundrum -- how will the hardest
commandment, murder, be broken.","Instead.; For one thing
(probably the most important reason) is that the dialogue is so badly
written as if by an amateur.; This in turn means that the actors, all
of whom have been seen in good films where they were very capable, are
here unable to act because they cannot mouth the words they are
supposed to say without appearing hammy, ridiculous.; Where, then, does the film fall apart and badly?; COMMANDMENTS is a bad
comedy which could have been a decent drama if Daniel Taplitz had had the
guts to take faith -- and the loss thereof -- at all seriously."
16508.0,Doug's 1st Movie,2000.0,"While watching the movie, I was also taken aback at how effective the 
voiceovers were, especially Constance Shulman, as Patti Mayonnaise, a 
fetching young girl with a delightful southern accent.; The colors were always vibrant and bright, 
and although the drawings were simple, they were also visually 
stimulating, something the recent dreary animated film, ""The King and 
I,"" cannot attest to.; At a scant 78 minutes, ""Doug's 1st Movie"" is short and entertaining 
enough to never overstay its welcome, and I was in constant enjoyment as 
I watched it.; Although Doug's real life has its limitations, he has a vivid dream
life.; because of the neat way it chronicles how an ordinary kid deals with ordinary
problems in extraordinary ways.","Apparently, town mogul Mr. Bluff (Doug Preis) has been
dumping toxic waste into Lucky Duck Lake.; The concept could have worked if it wasn't such a blatant rip-off of E.T.; 1999 - 78 minutes
Rated G (nothing objectionable).; Because of last year's horrendous, excruciating ""The Rugrats Movie,"" one 
honestly could only expect the worst from this recent animated feature 
film adaptation of the popular children's show, ""Doug's 1st Movie.""; The
result is mildly entertaining (though purely for kids), but possesses no
real draw to see it at the theater."

Ritchie Valens as a predecessor and influence on the band Los Lobos (aside

surprised to find that I greatly enjoyed all his songs.; Despite tragedy, LA BAMBA brings me a
feeling of hope, not least because its message seems to be that music will
always be remembered long after the musicians have gone, as with all art.; It has a certain 
quality which is best summarized as the triumph of the spirit over all
obstacles, including death.; Stray Cats'

rockabilly singer Eddie Cochran.; Second, the

not the most intelligent fun it could be, but is still the best suspense
film dealing with psychoanalysis that I can remember.; And while not many

not the greatest film, especially for a director as amazing as
Hitchcock.; The
film unfolds beautifully, holding our interest throughout, but the
ending is somewhat anti-climactic, but works, and even spurns one of the
most tense sequences at the end, even if it is pretty contrived.; Ingrid Bergman is very
believable, both as emotionally detached professional and as
woman blinded by love.; All in all, SPELLBOUND is more than solid, although still
overrated psychological thriller.","Unfortunately, her character is done
great disservice with the script that failed to properly
explain her transformation from former into latter;

16642.0,Days of Heaven,2001.0,"Despite quietly effective performances from the adult actors, the 
characters never click -- not with each other or with the audience.; The strains of Ennio Morricone's score form the perfect accompaniment to 
the lush visuals.; The cast, direction, cinematography and story are all
excellent and mark ""Days of Heaven"" as one of the most 
important American films of the 1970s.; After the union takes place, however, Bill is 
unable to contain his jealousy, especially when Abby shows genuine 
affection for her husband.; It is easy to see why ""Days of Heaven"" 
was so honored: it is a great argument for cinematography
rather than script or story as the most important element
of a film (I still believe that the script is the most 
important element).","Unfortunately, it's 
also not particularly involving.; I wanted to care about 
what was happening, but DAYS OF HEAVEN left me completely unconcerned.; ""Days of Heaven"" has a minimalist script and relies upon
the camerawork to flesh out the plot.; DAYS OF HEAVEN uses low-key methods to tell a 
melodramatic story, and the conflict between content and style distances

alike.; Nevertheless, this was a hilarious movie from my standpoint.; The soundtrack was also good and utilised
for some good jokes.; There are still a lot of funny digressions
from the plot--the Pimp of the Year pageant, Keenan on ""Soul Train"" and
the scene where Keenan's date begins taking off clothes and body parts
(one of the funniest movie scenes ever, methinks).; Wayans also uses the
talents of his family - his brother Damon (later noted in
THE LAST BOY SCOUT) shines in a small, but memorable role of
Mr. Big's goon.","I mean these muthah-fuckers who made this thing
don't got what it takes to cut it.; But then this story
started messin' around with this big muther-fuckin crime lord called Mr.
Big.; But there just ain't enough of the funny shit and there ain't enough
of the fightin' shit.; That probably
originates from years of low-riding cars with 1.21 jigowatt sound
systems blasting the music of various M.C.; I mean I was spectin' this to be
one bad-ass film."
17203.0,Blow Dry,1999.0,"Bill 
Nighy (the lead singer in Still Crazy) adds a deliciously conniving 
character as Phil's unscrupulous hairdressing rival, and Warren Clarke 
is funny as the town's showbiz-happy mayor.; What makes this an 
entertainment worth something close to the price of admission in this 
slow cinematic season is the cast, or at least most of it.; Phil and Shelly are former champion hairstylists, and Shelly, dying 
as she is, sees the championships as a chance to get the family back on 
speaking terms before she goes to the Great Salon in the Sky.; Rickman, 
always a moody cuss, uses his appealing Bassett hound world-weariness to 
great effect; when he allows a smile to crack the dour crust it's like 
sunshine breaking through a gloomy sky.; This tear-jerking tale is diametrically opposed to the glitzy
world of the hair championship.","The screenplay is manipulative, predictable, and 
uninspired.; The only semi-redeeming quality of the
film is its actors, but even this eccentric bunch couldn't save this oddly
fashioned movie screenplay.; The film lacks any real emotional narrative drive, falls flat on way too
many supposed jokes (although I couldn't really tell if they were supposed
to be funny sometimes, but I think colored sheep are supposed to be,
right?; Even a shot of Heidi
Klum's bush couldn't save this puppy (and I ain't kidding about that!).; Blow Dry doesn't have a lick of Monty's charm and, worse yet, just
isn't funny."
17414.0,Dunston Checks In,1997.0,"Seeing
him dressed in one crazy costume (Eugenie Krager) after another plus
his serious and soulful expressions are easily the best parts of the
show.; The best parts of this film are, by far, the ones that feature Sam, 
who easily outacts the human cast.; His miners outfit with his lantern on his head is my favorite.; But that's 
not all he has to worry about.; Lord Rutledge (Rupert Everett) is a nogoodnik, a jewel thief
who owns and uses Dunston, the monkey, to do the dirty work of
stealing.","Considering 
this movie alongside FOUR ROOMS, it's looking like a bad time for the 
motion picture hotel business.; None of these setups are original or funny.; As it is, however, this 
movie is like a bad episode of FAWLTY TOWERS -- minus Basil Fawlty.; Why is this in a movie aimed primarily at the 4-10 set?; ), but such limited 
amusement value doesn't justify a feature film."
17539.0,Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss,1994.0,"With a drag trio popping up from time to time as the film's Greek chorus 
and several inventive dream sequences, ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"" 
maintains a cheery, unpretentious tone, playing like a gay ""Gidget"" while 
gently dealing with the temptations and trauma of romance.; O'Haver has 
spun a rich, entertaining confection, a gay film that manages to be 
mainstream without compromising itself.; The 2.0 Dolby Surround
Sound works well for this film, which is mostly dialogue.; It's love at first sight, professional ethics be damned!; One of the nicest discoveries for me was the simple fact that
the story didn't really revolve around the issue of sexual
preference.","As if that wasn't
bad enough for a young person in the 90s, Billy has fallen for coffeehouse
waiter Gabriel (Brad Rowe), and he doesn't know whether or not Gabriel is gay.; I couldn't muster up much.; The film would have been more interesting, though perhaps not
necessarily as amusing, if it spent as much time focusing on Billy's photo
essay as it does his awkward mumblings and fumblings in the presence of
Gabriel.; Wishful
thinking on the director's behalf?; While looking for models to use in this project, Billy spies an
attractive waiter named Gabriel (Brad Rowe) at a local coffee shop,
and decides that he'd be perfect for the shoot."
17585.0,Surviving the Game,1999.0,"Gary Busey plays Chief Scenery
Chewer and his best bit is a monologue that sounds like warmed
leftovers from John Milius.; (No surprise
there.); Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","But even the appeal of teaming of
hulking heavies Rutger Hauer and Gary Busey (who play two of the
hunters) with violate rapper/actor Ice-T fades fast in the
less-than-capable hands of director Dickerson.; Every fight scene is
a blur and every chase has zero zest.; Unfortunately, neither the script nor the visuals relate what
an ""obvious"" trail looks like.; Gab gab gab go the character who spend the first
action-less hour speaking only in cliches.; The only cast member with charisma is Rutger Hauer."
17590.0,Deathtrap,1997.0,"She also happens to be a psychic and senses
something is wrong in the house; she feels pain everywhere, especially
in the study-area, where Sidney keeps his mementos from his other plays,
which include guns, knives, and swords.; The story builds in suspense when the cheery Clifford arrives in their
house to go over the play with his former teacher and Sidney carries out
his plan to kill him by trickily getting him to handcuff himself with
his souvenir Houdini handcuffs and then strangling him with another prop
from one of his plays.; The psychic clearly sees dangers
ahead and warns the couple to leave the house, she is especially fearful
about what will happen to Myra.; I felt used by the characterizations, as it took away a lot
of the pleasure derived from the snappy dialogue and the absurdity of
the storyline, that in the first act, worked really well.; It
was Dyan Cannon, with her sweet giggles and frustrated looks, who
brought a needed restraint to the film, and as long as she was onscreen
the film had an edge to it.","Lumet as always, sucks any subtlety out of his films.; She begins to think, maybe he isn't joking, that he actually
might kill for a hit play.; Too many contrivances made everything seem
so superficial, which is a shame, because the film did have its funny
moments.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

17644.0,Barney's Great Adventure,1999.0,"This leaves the
group on an city-wide, hour-long expedition to recover the magical egg,
allowing for plenty of sing alongs and guest appearances by Barney's humble
friends, Baby Bop and BJ.; Alas, from many of the right
perspectives, BARNEY'S GREAT ADVENTURE: THE MOVIE is quite tolerable, and if
you're under five years old, it's probably wonderful.; Marketed sometimes as
BARNEY'S GREAT ADVENTURE: THE MOVIE, it would more aptly have been
labeled BARNEY'S GREAT ADVENTURE: THE SING-ALONG.; It's like something you chase
 for so long, but then you don't know how to react when you
 get it.; It is rated G and is
appropriate for all ages.","Even allowing for the lack of a real script, the actors
demonstrate very little acting talent.; The target audience of preschoolers isn't likely
to scoff at the low-budget special effects or mock the amateurish acting
abilities, and since this film is for them, and not us, why should we be so
quick to trespass on their innocent wonderment with our magicless, adult
cynicism?; For a film aimed at
the 2-7 year old set, the decision to cast child actors all around
10-years-old seems surprising and inappropriate.; It is during this number that he encourages the
audience to join in, at which point my already-cringing self was
reaching for a vomit bag.; On the other hand, Abby and Marcella couldn't be happier it seems, running
around, playing hide-and-go-seek and tag, and basically using the most archaic
toy of all - their imaginations."
17770.0,Trial and Error,1998.0,"Its not fair to compare this film
with ""Vinny,"" since both are excellent comedies.; It has marvelous
acting and a beautiful story, but with its low budget it will open at a
few art house around the country and be seen by almost no one.; ""Trial and Error"" is a nicely balanced blend of zany comedy and touching
romance.; Both Daniels and Theron are likable, and they really 
click together.; Michael Richards is certainly the funniest second banana on television
today with his wacky portrayal as Kramer on the top rated television
comedy 'Seinfeld'.","I recommend you avoid
this unfunny comedy.; I wish I could find one good reason for you to see this waste
of time, but I can't.; Perhaps it was because the movie just wasn't funny.; On the bad side, this
movie is not funny, interesting or enjoyable in any which way possible.; That's what you might
have expected if the film had been set up as a star vehicle for Richards;
the idea of LIAR LIAR with Richards in the lead is primally disturbing."
17771.0,Sunshine,1998.0,"Subtle.; Later in the picture Rosemary Harris (Jennifer Ehle's real-life mother)
gives a wonderfully warm and inviting performance as the older Valerie.; Fiennes'
roles, and Rosemary Harris' later, are both unique and touching.; Fiennes'
roles, and Rosemary Harris' later, are both unique and touching.; At the end of the film and the century, Hungary knows freedom for the
first time in almost a century.","The problem is that this two hour wonder is
followed by a third, which essentially kills all the fun.; The problem is that this two hour wonder is
followed by a third, which essentially kills all the fun.; The filmmaking, though
well-intentioned and intelligently presented, was just too dull and
uninspiring to sustain interest in the lesson it is trying to teach
about the mess bigotry and politics makes, even if the lesson is an
important one and shouldn't be ignored.; But, 3 hours is a big investment of time 
for a moviegoer and Fiennes does not give a compelling enough performance to 
warrant the time for most.; What they don't realise is that just because a story might be true 
doesn't make it interesting."
17790.0,Zone Troopers,1915.0,"Bilson and De Meo 
make excellent use of Empire's typically low budget.; Although it is 
all deliberated through a knowing sense of modern irony.; In `Zone 
Troopers' Bilson and De Meo make a splendid homage to WWII GI combat 
movies.; Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Throughout all of Bilson and De Meo's films and tv series runs an 
enthusiasm for comic-books and sf fandom - the end credits here for 
instance are shown across mockups of pulp sf magazine covers.","If the film didn't 
revel so much in being a B-movie, it could pass for a far better 
budgeted production.; Director - Danny Bilson, Screenplay - Bilson & Paul De Meo,

17795.0,My Fellow Americans,1988.0,"The ill-assorted duo make beautifully ironic music together.It is
preordained that some variant of friendship will eventually emerge,
somewhat along the lines of the Lemmon-Walter Matthau comedies or the
ever-funny Matthau-GeorgeBurns ""The Sunshine Boys.""; Surprisingly, Jack Lemmon is upstaged by the relaxed and
hilariously moody performance turned in by James Garner who settles
into his character almost with poetic ease while Lemmon plays his role
with stiff uptightness but both profiles work on a professional actor's
level and the contrasting personality of the two is convincingly
executed.; Cast: Jack Lemmon (Russell P. Kramer), James Garner (Matt Douglas), 
         Dan Aykroyd (William Haney), John Heard (Ted Matthews), Wilford
         Brimley (Joe Hollis), Everett McGill (Col. Paul Tanner), Lauren
         Bacall (Margaret Kramer).; (Warner Bros.)
Starring:  Jack Lemmon, James Garner, Dan Aykroyd, John Heard, Wilford
Brimley, Everett McGill.; All in all, this is a highly 
entertaining and charming comedy that will make a good rental.","What a waste.; The tone is
terrible and the banter is worse.; What drags MY FELLOW AMERICANS down, however, isn't 
its reliance upon buddy movie conventions, but its failed attempts to 
inject embarrassingly trite melodrama and recycled action sequences into 
the story.; Here they go from
bad to worse.; Besides, if you want to see stupidity and silliness on a 
presidential scale, all you really have to do is turn on the news."
17796.0,Freaked,1999.0,"a perfect combination!; It's the last place in the world you'd expect to find a Freak 
Show, but that's what Winter and his friends run into, and then become a 
part of.; Readers of Fangoria' will probably love it.; ), 
who I find hysterically funny.; Randy Quaid, one of the few cast members not 
smothered in makeup, gives a jolly, cackling performance as the freakshow 
proprietor.","Story starts with former child actor 
Ricky (Winter, who looks like a throwback to a 50s juvie feature) hiring 
himself out as a spokesperson for a big corporation with concerns in South 
America.; It's 
clear that FREAKED is pitching for the youth market straight from its 
opening titles, which could easily stand alone as a video clip if you were 
to remove the credits.; I'm impressed that Winter got the likes of Brooke Shields and 
Mr T to send themselves up so outrageously while also being game enough 
himself to be disfigured for most of the film's running time in laborious 
makeup (his buddy Reeves contributes an uncredited performance and is even 
more unrecognizable as Dawg Boy').; There's plenty of amusing material to choose from in the lineup of freaks 
that become Winters' allies, but my personal favorite would have to be Bob 
Goldthwaite's Sockhead' (that face!; And if you're tired of computer-generated visuals then you'll 
appreciate the domestic feel of the film's effects  there's a whole pile of 
latex on show and even some claymation (which includes a glimpse of the 
Cyclops from THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD)."
17819.0,Her Alibi,1996.0,"HER ALIBI is a pleasant lightweight piece of entertainment.; HER ALIBI also features
several familiar actors in roles that less familiar actors could have easily
filled.; Blackwood convinces Nina to
stay at his house but he is torn between infatuation and suspicion.; Then he sees Nina, a beautiful Romanian woman on
trial for murder, and decides to get involved by telling the police that she
was with him at the time of the murder.; Polito knows he is lying and warns him that if she murders
Blackwood, the alibi can never be questioned.","Another and unfortunately larger sequence
involving a cat is merely a dramatization of an old joke.; The
     mystery is predictable.; HER ALIBI does not actually start as a light comedy.; For four years he has been trying to squeeze out
another without success.; (Do *not* try this trick at home,
boys and girls.)"
17908.0,My Dog Skip,1999.0,"The wonderfully honest performances only help to
enforce the subtle power the film contains.; But that's what makes
it an ideal family entertainment: harmless to the kids, while offering
something deep and valuable for the adults.; Luke Wilson was a pleasant surprise, for in a rare dramatic
performance, he excels at everything that he usually accomplishes in a
comedy.; The film joyously reminds us all of just how wonderful life can be.; Bacon and Lane are both
terrific.","The southern accent Muniz uses seems fake
and at times he lacks any emotion (no nine year old
would have a blank look on his face if a drunk looter
through an empty beer bottle at him).; What's odd and annoying about ""My Dog Skip"" is how the filmmakers take a
can't-miss premise and gunk it up.; Yet My Dog Skip, in its attempt to run the PAC gauntlet and please its
target audience at the same time, ends up being a totally forgettable
cinematic effort.; As if that wasn't
enough, we must suffer though a cheesy voice-over narrative that adds
absolutely nothing to the production, although it does occasionally
provide a few unintended laughs.; Other actors are wasted
in My Dog Skip."
17915.0,Dance with Me,1999.0,"It can be humankind's ultimate statement of
grace and beauty (""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle"")
but can also be a hotly contested sport event (""The Tango
Lesson"").; Perhaps 
Rafael's most charming scene has him stranded on a lawn just as the 
sprinklers activate;  here Chayanne does a hopping and stomping routine 
that nods at Gene Kelly, the simulated rain bringing out his love of 
life.; Vanessa Williams, who plays Ruby, is a 
perfect match for the equally beautiful Chayanne, and the sweet 
chemistry between them feels genuine.; Vanessa Williams also
shows remarkable range as Ruby, covering a wide spectrum of emotions and
never once faltering.; All of her scenes contain a great deal of heart,
and the wonderful routine she performs with Rafael near the film's finale
generated a round of delighted applause at the screening I attended.","DANCE WITH ME comes 
alive periodically but spends way too much time with low-grade soap 
opera material.; If they'd been spoken by less-skilled actors, however, they could've come
across as laughably trite.; Dancing makes an otherwise banal life bearable (""Saturday
Night Fever"") but can be awfully cruel (""They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?"").; Why do the 
characters spend so much time on boat docks and in truck junkyards when 
they could be dancing?; And there are 
a few too-long pauses, which caused me to doubt the adage, ""If you can't 
say something nice, don't say anything at all."""
17990.0,Impromptu,1995.0,"But then this is a great ensemble cast with wonderful, memorable
performances from every single member.; However, I urge
people of the first category to see IMPROMPTU, too; it is a wonderful
film, funny, alive, visually and musically rich, driven by complex
performances by some really wonderful actors.; If you
find those attributions necessary, you may not feel drawn initially to
IMPROMPTU because you have not been infected yet with these fascinating
personalities and artists.; It is a first-rate movie rich in performances.; Fortunately, for the viewer who believes that two great
performances are better than one, Peters is more than up to the
challenge of holding her own on screen.","The squire-type even says ""Bon
appetit"" with an English accent.; And Sand is
having problems with a past that continues to make claims on her,
ludicrously and ridiculously.; If you find the attributions irritating and
inadequate, you are the primary audience for this film.; Meanwhile another
claimant has entered the lists for the reluctant Pole.; (You will note the lack of many names in this notice--my source
material was destroyed before I could write this and I have a
Emmenthalerisch memory (full of holes).)"
18074.0,Duets,1996.0,"The most intriguing story involves Todd Woods (Paul Giamatti), a driven
salesman who suffers a meltdown while chasing the American Dream, who
chucks it all to go on stage and sing, and his connection with Reggie
Kane (Andre Braugher), an ex-con with the voice of an angel who is
unwilling to follow society's rules.; Six people, each unhappy in his or her own way, get
together in fairly believable ways, each showing the other that
life really is worth living if only you can make a few changes.; Its impact is helped
greatly by the engagingly nuanced performances of Giamatti and Braugher.; That it doesn't always come together as a fluid film, is pushed
aside by how zany and entertaining it was, with a good sense of energy
released through some risks that were taken by not trying to put
together a familiar film.; If you like good music, ""Duets"" is a movie you should see, despite its
many flaws and shortcomings.","Actually, it's worse, since the karaoke singers in the film aren't bad 
enough to laugh at.; With more background this could have been interesting,
but instead it's like being hit over the head with a mallet.; Watching the intelligent Gwyneth Paltrow trying to play a dumb character 
like Liv is at best disconcerting and at worst embarrassing.; And why did he even bother to show up?; Unfortunately, director Bruce Paltrow (Gwyneth's father) cannot get
screenwriter John Byrum's script to gel."
18153.0,Steal This Movie,1995.0,"D'Onofrio is a revelation as he gives a beautifully modulated performance of 
extreme highs and lows, showcasing Hoffman's improvisational delivery in 
nearly everything he does yet also showing a man living in paranoia and fear 
about his family, friends and foes and his insular life.; Janeane Garofalo 
also gets a chance to develop an empathetic and compassionate side to Anita, 
who also has her doubts about Hoffman's other lover and his insularity yet 
she deeply loves him.; She makes some daring choices that highlight Anita's love and
sympathy, and many times, this is Garofalo's movie.; The film moves at an
effectively erratic pace: action in the real world moves fairly swiftly,
but once it's in the world of the mind, the pace becomes more languid,
befitting the surrealism of dreams.; works precisely because it stays strictly true to its 
opinions.","That is what happens with ""Steal This Movie,"" which glides from one 
event to the other giving it a disconnected flow - it is like watching a 
""Biography"" segment complete with badly used, pseudo voice-overs from Nixon 
and Hoover.; ""Dull is deadly"", Abbie explains as the rationale for his 
outlandish theatrics.; is neither notorious nor
radical, and while showing off a talented cast in some lively sequences,
it tramples down some tired old trails.; Rated R.  Running time: 108 minutes.; Rated R.  Running time: 108 minutes."
18168.0,About Adam,1996.0,"When he
accepts: Peg is happy, Laura is devastated, and Alice is surprised.; When Adam enters the pub,
she's immediately attracted to him and happy that he's both so shy and friendly.; There is no trace of the poverty
present in Alan Parker's ""Angela's Ashes,"" and in fact
the action centers on a middle-class family presided over by
the free-spirited Peggy (Rosaleen Linehan) who brings up a
trio of daughters who are so different from one another they
appear to come from different countries.; She invites him home on their first date and he meets the entire family.; There's a
running gag throughout the film, how Adam tells different versions of how he
obtained the Jaguar to whomever he's with.","That was supposed to be funny and
show that he might have some problems with telling the truth.; Rated R.  Running time: 100 minutes.; He's a bullshit artist
extraordinaire, with an easy manner about him, who cunningly knows how to reach
out to women, which was mildly satisfactory for about 45 minutes of the film but
after that became annoying.; The film's image of him left
me confused about what I was supposed to think of him.; With predictable relish Adam charms all three sisters with different approaches
and takes all to bed."
18197.0,Running on Empty,,"This is one of the best films I've seen up to now, a movie that you
mustn't miss.; By his quiet and sensitive direction Sidney Lumet creates a high inner
suspense.; And all the actors are - as usual in a Lumet film - excellent,
especially River Phoenix, who earned a well deserved Academy Award
nomination for his masterful performance (maybe the best in his much too
short life), and Christine Lahti.; It's not difficult to forget
that some of his films aren't great (""The Appointment"", ""The Last of the Mobile
Hotshots"", ""The Morning After"", ""A Stranger Among Us"", ""Guilty as Sin""),
because there are many superb motion pictures among his films, like ""Twelve
Angry Men"", ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"", ""The Pawnbroker"", ""Serpico"",
""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Network"", ""Prince of the City"", ""The Verdict"", the often
underrated ""Q & A"" and this excellent drama ""RUNNING ON EMPTY"".; But the political aspects
enrich the film and stimulate us to discuss about what's more important:
to change the world with dangerous actions or also to remember the
consequences of these actions not only for one's own life, but for the
lives of one's children too.","Actually it would have been imaginable to treat this
theme in front of a non-political background.; But that would destroy the
family.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
18203.0,Big Night,1993.0,"A wholly
original film that's packed with great performances and privileged
moments.; The acting by Tucci is excellent, but Shalhoub steals the show.; The 
bond between brothers is developed in a believable way, with the usual 
mix of friction and wordless affection.; One of the real joys of this past season, and definite must-see.; While the film can get a bit talky at times (beware of the scenes
with subtitles), it's overall a very moving and delightful first work
for these guys.","Apparently to actually
star in a film he had to co-write the script, co-produce the film, and
then co-direct it.; Nothing big.; Driver, from CIRCLE OF FRIENDS and the Masterpiece Theater TV show ""The
Politician's Wife,"" is a great actress, but her role here is secondary
does not allow her to show off her talents.; Except for that one word,
the movie would be PG.; Many scenes have little dialog and in fact there is a
reasonably long epilogue with no words at all just food preparation and
consumption."
18212.0,Better Than Chocolate,1999.0,"There's a sense that if love may not conquer all, it certainly
makes everything easier to cope with.; `Better Than Chocolate' is better than most.; It is in the erotic
romance and the quirky comedy that the audiences will find enjoyment and
pleasure in BETTER THAN CHOCOLATE.; Judy
performs at a nightclub, in which the performers sing and dance to a
host of fun numbers -- the best being ""Julie Christy Makes Me So Misty.""; I especially liked the dance club sequence, 
where the one girl gives the other a rose;  and, the body painting.","Then irritating and offensive.; And, what was she hoping to prove?; This is one of the year¹s worst scripts, about so much it¹s about nothing.; The un-rated movie's sex scenes are pretty steamy-hot but ought not 
to annoy a savvy public.; And, 
why do gay-bashers have to make an appearance (twice, no less) at all?"
18215.0,Boxing Helena,2000.0,"After she wakes up, Helena
discovers not only that she is prisoner in Cavanaugh's
stylish residence, but also that Cavanaugh amputated her
legs in order to prevent her from escaping.; Jennifer Chambers Lynch has borrowed a lot of her father's
technique and style, and Mr. Lynch's own response to the film is that
he (not surprisingly) ""really liked it.""; BOXING HELENA has elements to
recommend it, but there's a lot that has to be willingly overlooked to
get to that.; A scene where Nick presents the
limbless Helena with a gun and offers to kill himself or her at her
request is effective because it touches on the core emotions
experienced by both parties.; BOXING HELENA has the raw, gritty feel of a junior high-school
drama production.","The movie is painfully like a
bad Lynch movie -- or better to say, like a bad imitation that didn't have
the initative to at least be a parody.; Jennifer Lynch obviously lacks talents in directing
and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are
supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow
the standards of Playboy videos.; But, the result was extremely disappointing film, which
quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion.; People spit out ridiculous lines with no conviction
whatsoever.; Sherilyn Fenn contributed
to this film mostly by her looks, but even the her greater
effort in acting couldn't help this film."

story moving along about as quickly as your average PBS special on tree

writers to create this piece of garbage?); I mean this poor girl looks 
so embarrassed I half expected her to break down and start crying right in

in Locke's world.; At times,
it is not an easy film to watch, and there are scenes of frighteningly
realistic violence.; But there are unexpected twists and stings in the tail which confound us
as much as they seem to confound Billy, our guide though this nightmare
world.; Unflinching in its dialogue and depiction, Essex Boys is a brilliantly
acted portrayal of the lives of a disparate group of villains who form
the underbelly of Essex society.; Essex Boys is a gripping,
compelling story.","Jason Locke is a man with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.; We would
have prejudged it as a Big Mistake.; However, the writers are keen to
stress that is a fictional study of the events leading to that night.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

18402.0,Something to Talk About,1997.0,"The best one that is
printable is Wyly's when he says, ""I may have fooled around a little bit,
but I have never cheated.""; Into this tableaux, tragedy strikes immediately.; If you are a female, preferably married, preferably Southern,
preferably jilted by your husband, and preferably interested in horses,
you'll love this film.; Eddie's family is also
loaded and is in a lucrative real estate deal with Wyly.; Distributor: Warner Brothers Even though it's being marketed as a romantic comedy, SOMETHING TO 
TALK ABOUT is really concerned with the relationships of two generations 
of fathers and daughters.","The worst is Gena Rowlands.; At least there are a few funny-to-hilarious moments that save this film 
from being a complete waste of time.; The whole film comes off as a sad experiment in marketing--to see how
many women the movie could pack in the theater.; I do not even remember any smoking.; His is basically a 
""mail it in"" performance, but, considering the script he's working from, 
it's no wonder."
18410.0,Project X,1993.0,"In particular he was a 
joy in  Biloxi Blues (1988),  impressive in Glory (1989, a howl  in 
the relatively underrated The Freshman (1990),  and a key presence in 
the very underrated  Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994) .; Matthew Broderick, then fresh  from his title role in the delightful 
Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), was and still is one of our most 
likable young (and later, youthful) actors.; The chimps are irresistibly interesting and entertaining.; Even so, I'm keeping it on 
the recommended list of above-average flicks.; But the  film sets a solid sense of poignancy that builds up and 
could carry you through the frenetic wind-up.","Scientists are trying to teach a dolphin
to speak, but it will talk only to the cleaning-woman and then only when
nobody else is around.; That play dealt with a cleaning-woman
at a soul-less research institute.; In fact, I was not excited at all.; When I heard
that in this film Matthew Broderick was causing trouble at an Air Force base
on which experimentation was being done on intelligent chimpanzees, I said
to myself, ""I even know that story.; Then the relationship
between the two grows and the story follows predictable routes."
18446.0,Swing Shift,1987.0,"On another level, SWING SHIFT is a
simple and sweet love story.; Nevertheless, I was able to enjoy SWING SHIFT for what it is: a
film with memorable and sympathetic characters, but one lacking in
substance and lasting emotional impact.; Hawn gives
a strong and credible performance as a woman who is torn between her
devotion to her husband on the one hand and her loneliness and attraction
to her suitor on the other.; Most critics, despite their lukewarm response to SWING SHIFT,
highly praised Christine Lahti's performance--as Hawn's strong willed
friend--and singled her out as the main reason to see the film.; Hawn's character in SWING SHIFT is much deeper
than the cutesy, air-headed roles she usually plays.","Her
acclaimed performance, however, did not particularly impress me.; The movie does not provide any fresh insights into the
predicament of working women during and after the war.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

18486.0,My Girl,1995.0,"MY GIRL does eventually wear you down with its
histrionics, but you feel resentful for having your tears jerked so
violently from you.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Unfortunately, this paper-thin premise doesn't lead to anything
meaningful.; A bigger problem: the
dramatic scenes, which should have been sensitive and heartfelt, are
heavy-handed and cliched.; It's hard to
blame the actors, however, when their characters are so underwritten.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
18495.0,Folks!,1998.0,"Most
people would find this twist to be repulsive, but me and my sick, twisted
mind enjoyed it.; There he discovers that his father (Ameche) is
rapidly losing his mind.; Soon after, he loses his job, his car, his
furniture, his apartment, and his wife and kids leave him.; After their trailer burns down, Selleck takes his
parents back home with him.; Email Me At chuckd21@southeast.net Please visit my movie reviews web site at http://users.southeast.net/~chuckd21/
You'll be glad you did.","The whole next hour is just like that.; Then we meet Selleck's dad (who we're told has something like Senior
Senility Disorder Complex but don't be fooled, it's just a nice way to say
Alzheimer's) and now for some reason the writer can't decide whether or not
to write a comedy or a drama.; An attempted one anyway.; Then, the film takes a truly bizarre turn when Selleck's mother suggests
that Selleck should kill them in order to get the insurance money.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
18561.0,Oxygen,1996.0,"Maura Tierney also
turns in a spectacular performance, portraying a very troubled but
courageous woman.; Written and directed with style by Richard Shepard (The Linguini
Incident), ""Oxygen"" is a compelling psychodrama, whose story is
sickening but is superbly played by an excellent cast.; New York City looks good, from the moneyed streets that
finds Frances on an afternoon stroll with her dog to the
tunnels and byways around Grand Central Station, and
photographer Sarah Cawley's work is given a splendidly
spooky score by Rolfe Kent.; Its premise, that cops and bad
guys sometimes share the same evil inclinations, is given
believable cinematic dimensions because of a especially
good performances by Maura Tierney as a cop with a history
of emotionally sick behavior and Adrien Brody as the sharp-
witted 25-year-old psychopath who has her number--and not
just the one on her badge.; The two prove to be in a way one of
a kind though not nearly in the same degree.","We
soon learn that money--not even one million dollars' worth of
it--is the psycho's real goal.; (That New York State, in which the crime has
taken place, has not performed an execution in decades and
is likely to sentence this psycho to a life term at best is
overlooked.); ""Oxygen"" had some fresh air in its tank which it
leaked out at times to refreshen some of its derivative scenes,
especially the opening subway scene, where the lead police couple come
across a wanted felon and give chase, in a scene that looked like it
came right out of ""The French Connection.""; Shepard chooses instead to exhibit
much of the perversion through the verbal interchange
between cop and killer.; Think as well as that executive who
was kidnapped a year or so ago, buried alive, and ransomed."

Visit Chuck's Movie Reviews at http://users.southeast.net/~chuckd21/
Over 1,500 movies rated and/or reviewed!; ""Ten to
Midnight"" surprisingly though, has some originality to it.; I guess a
studio head thought it sounded good.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.; Have A Question Or Comment?","The scenes which depict the
murders are done without any style and instead are just a gratuitious as any
slasher film.; It's cheaply made.; And the title apparently has no meaning whatsoever.; That aside, there are just too many things about the film which prevent it
from getting a good rating.; Still, a decent attempt."
18603.0,Hands on a Hardbody: The Documentary,1998.0,"This makes for a different type of documentary, one with a
less serious tone than most others but one that is fun to watch, as the
varied contestants of different ages, sizes, genders, and races, each
have their idea on what it takes for them to win.; Paul Prince feels he is in great
condition and thinks he can go the distance.; On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Hands on a Hard Body"" is a crazy, incredible, intense 8.; Bindler 
(McConaughey's best friend) captures the nervous energy, stamina, exhaustion, and determination of the various challengers, revealing their authentic quirks and humorous eccentricities.; Their collective stamina is
amazing.","The result is a quirky, non-dramatic, human interest
story about the need for Texans to drive a pickup, as if it was their
God given right to have one.; Try to
convince your local art house to book it.; By the end of the movie, the
viewers become glued to their seats wondering who among their newfound
friends will next succumb to the pain and have to drop out or will be
forced out through some silly blunder.; Each time someone leaves the
vehicle you can almost hear the audience sigh.; One guy ""fasts"" during the
match, eating only oranges and Snickers."
18722.0,Mr. Baseball,1991.0,"In other words, I
loved it.; The baseball part is absolutely hilarious and made the film worth going
to.; In Japan, Selleck finds that many of the
customs are different than in the U.S., and he must learn to cope with
them.; It doesn't
matter whether you see this film in the theater or on video cassette, it
will be just as good either way.; And the direction, by Fred Schepisi (THE RUSSIA HOUSE), is well
done.","I expect this film to be a box office bomb, and
then will be a hit on home video, just because so many good films are
out or coming soon that this one will get left behind.; Unfortunately the humor lags there and the film starts to drag along.; BASEBALL is a funny, but pointless comedy.; 105 min., PG-13, Comedy, 1992
Director: Fred Schepisi
Cast: Tom Selleck, Dennis Haysbert, Ken Takakura, Art La Fleur Tom Selleck, a major league ball player, is in a slump.; If only the film had been cut by fifteen minutes, I think
it would have ended up much better."
18892.0,Jawbreaker,1992.0,"Faring even
better than McGowan is Rebecca Gayheart, who is always exceptionally believable
as her roles.; In the other central roles, Rose McGowan is perfectly cast as the 
unredeemable Courtney who (slight spoiler alert ahead) gets her just 
desserts in the satisfying climax at the prom, a la ""Carrie,"" cleverly 
set to the tune of ""Young at Heart,"" by Frank Sinatra.; Jawbreaker explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and those
social and political cliques that make adolescence a nightmare for
those who don't fit in.; If you think this 
movie is funny, that tells me things about you I don't want to know.""; Liz is everyone's favorite because she's both
beautiful and kind.","All in all, a horrible disappointment.; Not 
good.; If he ever breaks up with McGowan his
buddies will surely give him shit for being whipped into appearing in such a
lame attempt at a hard-edged black comedy.); Judy Greer is undeniably awful as her one
dimensional, annoying character, as she overacts every line she has.; To call
""Jawbreaker"" garbage would be to insult garbage."
18913.0,Betsy's Wedding,2001.0,"Alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change
of pace from the usual summer fare.; Ally Sheedy, in a wonderfully understated performance, is one of
the film's most pleasant surprises.; Many of the supporting characters give wonderful performance.; Written and directed by Alda, BETSY'S WEDDING is a vibrant
slice-of-life, mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical
humor.; Joe Pesci gives his
patented hyper performance as Betsy's uncle.","They are never 100% bad,
but they are always inconsistent, with good performances hidden by poor
performances, boring writing intercut with wry observations on life, and
clumsy direction.; Both Ringwald and
Alda are incredibly dull in this movie, as is her fiance.; She's supposed to be a dress designer, but she looks more like a
clown.; This movie is rated R, probably just because of some sex-talk.; She looks
hideous with her short-cropped orange hair, red lip-stick and grotesque
outfits."
18937.0,Quest for Camelot,1994.0,"The drawings are well done; the story is excellent.; Celine is surprisingly effective and affective.; The Prayer by Celine Dion
this is definitely the best song in the movie.; The Prayer - Andrea Bocelli
great voice.; She's actually very subtle and her ""prayer"" is
believable.","Bad.; Bad.; It's dull, uninspired, and, worst of 
all, characterized by artwork that could charitably be called 
""unimpressive.""; It ranges from barely passable to
glaringly awful.; And personality, we learn from this 
mess, goes a very long way."
19052.0,Light It Up,1999.0,"After Columbine and other school shootings, this is a
surprisingly effective civics lesson about the dangers of
stereotyping.; _Light_It_Up_ (R) ** 1/2 (out of ****) _Light_It_Up_, written and directed by Craig Bolotin, is different from
most urban dramas in that in emphasizes ideas more than violence; in
fact, the quantity of the latter is surprisingly low for its genre.; It's a sad reality, but also one
that makes perfect sense given the circumstances.; His
performance is intense and surprisingly powerful; like Ice Cube, Will
Smith, L.L.; His DEAD CALM is one of the best because it is as much a sea
adventure as a murder plot.","That five of the six
kidlets can look at a wounded cop and decided that he isn't hurt so bad
is beyond me.; Rather than having just bad kids risk getting shot at by the army of
cops who quickly surround the building, the story has some model
students being stupid enough to take part in such a guaranteed loser of
a situation.; Narrating the picture, Robert 
Ri'chard, as Ziggy, leaves no impression at all, nor does Clifton Collins 
Jr.'s role of Rivers.; Its as if 
writer-director Bolotin was so enthusiastic about actually making a movie 
that he forgot to concentrate and make one that was actually rewarding.; A well-meaning, yet derivative, film of this sort is basically made or broken 
by the writing and portrayals of the characters, and both aspects are 
unsatisfactorily handled."
19214.0,Passion of Mind,1996.0,"Lighten up
and enjoy yourself--in both worlds.; Dreams may
seem real enough when they are in progress, but that is only
because you have not been able to ask yourself this simple
question.; Each believes it to be a wonderful dream reality and
each is envious of aspects of the other.; With 2 fabulous lives, 2 designer-decorated homes, 2 supportive lovers,
2 beautiful countries, 2 high-profile professions and 2 wise shrinks,
Marie/Marty would appear to have it all.; Each seeks out a shrink
to help deal with the dream fantasy and come to grips with reality.","The director appears to have relinquished control
to Moore since his awkward staging makes sense only if one assumes that
the film's purpose is nothing other than to be a vanity piece for Moore.; This poor old male sat there
thinking ""huh?""; The conclusion is kind of plausible, somewhat predictable and reasonably
satisfying, but it certainly doesn't atone for making the audience
endure the rest of this silly, lackluster film.; But this
tepid drama, the first English-language film by Belgian director Alain
Berliner (""My Vie en Rose""), is forgettable - at best.; The
pretentious script is full of such mumbo-jumbo."
19300.0,Carry On Behind,1997.0,"The partnership between Sommer and Williams is very effective and 
amusing.; This is what binds the movie together.; Joan Sims stands out as 
the demanding mother-in-law, Bernard Bresslaw and Patsy Rowlands work 
well together as husband and wife, and Carol Hawkins and Sherrie Hewson 
are a welcome addition to the cast.; A relative flop at the cinema, this movie deserves a lot more 
recognition.; Although the regular cast is 
depleted, the ones that remain show that they can still make a good Carry 
on film.","On the other hand, there are low-key performances from Kenneth Connor 
and Peter Butterworth as Barnes the handyman, and there are very poor 
performances by Windsor Davies and Jack Douglas who spend far too much 
time on the screen!; One of the last entries in the long-running Carry on series, Carry on 
Behind is very similar to Carry on Camping in that it involves a group of 
holidaymakers descending on a 'caravan' site.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
19348.0,Girlfight,2000.0,"She's believable
physically, training and sparring in the gym.; She subtly projects emotions
as well, such as when, discovering a home totally unlike her own, her eyes 
dart around, taking in all the family pictures.; Whether on the streets, in homes, at school or the gym, 
we know we're in a real, urban neighborhood.; The unique score by Theodore Shapiro is heavily percussive, often sounding like 
castanets backing a metronome.; This method is simple, yet effective.","I guess my biggest problem with the film would have to be its lack of
tightness.; Before I go on with my singular-minded tirade of why one should avoid
Girlfight at all costs, let me ask an open-ended question: how many times
have we seen this before?; Plus, the script is burdened with
heavy-handed dramatic confrontations and awkward dialogue.; But it's way too much, as the overall production suffers
from an utter lack of competence in the editing department (no surprise:
Plummy Tucker, a self-indulgent John Sayles collaborator, is responsible
for the mess) and off-kilter photography that misses a lot more of the
action than it captures.; The gym features lots of clichéd signs (""Champions are made not 
born."""
19366.0,Josie and the Pussycats,1996.0,"Great performances from both actors!; :) CRITIQUE:
A cute, harmless little movie that will likely be enjoyed by both young boys
and girls, with catchy, bubblegum songs, many clever in-jokes, some lulls,
some misses but an overall sense of fun.; ""Josie and the Pussycats"" is a surprisingly fun lark that should appeal to
the same audience that enjoyed last year's ""Charlie's Angels.""; Usually spectacular, Posey delivers a 
chillingly off-kilter performance as the weird, wacky woman CEO of 
MegaRecords.; Before long, Wyatt has signed The Pussycats (now known as ""Josie and the 
Pussycats"") to a scorching record deal, and in a week, have shot to the #1 
spot on the Billboard charts, with millions of obsessive fans around the 
world clamoring to see them perform in person.","Unfortunately, this movie
only semi-succeeds with too many jokes which try to be funny, but aren't, a
few corny ""romance"" moments and a way too obvious story line (I know, I
know...that's not why we see movies like this one, but still!).; Drummer Melody Valentine (Tara Reid, Just
Visiting) is just too dumb to pay attention, bassist Valerie Brown (Rosario
Dawson, Down to You) is too concerned that she's not getting enough credit,
and Josie (Rachael Leigh Cook, Blow Dry) is too busy trying to get Alan M.
(Gabriel Mann, Outside Providence) to say that he loves her.; In other supporting roles, Gabriel 
Mann (2000's ""Cherry Falls""), as Josie's best friend and potential boyfriend, 
Alan M, is appropriately bland, as is Paulo Costanzo (2000's ""Road Trip""), as 
the girls' novice agent.; It's also odd to see a film about brainwashing, conformity
and product placement without any ads for The Gap.; But like
I said before, there were also way too many moments in which not much was
happening, or ""funniness"" was supposed to occur, but it just didn't gel
(like Parker Posey's character, who wasn't as humorous as you'd think)."
19371.0,Mr. Nanny,2000.0,"- James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Although Madeline Zima's talents are 
admittedly limited, she's a cute little girl, and occasionally manages to 
brighten an otherwise-bleak experience.; Few who see MR. NANNY will disagree.; Perhaps your sanity 
will be salvageable.; Watching ""the Hulkster"" sermonize about family values and the importance 
of telling your kids that you love them is a truly stomach-churning 
experience.","Watching the whole thing is sort of like being strapped to 
a chair and forced to watch the worst three re-runs of THREE'S COMPANY in 
succession.; The 
production values are poor, the music score is annoying, the dialogue is 
stilted and insipid, and the action scenes are shoddily photographed.; Here, it's handled in such a pedestrian 
manner that it comes across with the audible clunk of a standup comic's 
joke falling flat.; Even by the 
generally low-quality standards of television movies, this film is 
unacceptable.; For a movie to rank alongside CHILDREN OF THE CORN 2, it has to be 
undeniably awful."
19380.0,White Sands,1997.0,"It's a pleasure to watch him work his way deeper and deeper into
the mystery he first uncovers in the New Mexico desert.; Dafoe and Mastrantonio are
each excellent in their efforts.; This is a handsome movie with some fine moments.; Anyway, I can't recommend this movie based on plot, but it's a
pretty picture, and Mastrantonio's character has an absolutely gorgeous
house.; Mastrantonio is
a particular favorite of mine and here she is well used to create an
interesting character, a rich stylish woman with some distinctly
unstylish connections, a woman who is lonely and who faces her
loneliness with humor and a hunger for adventure.","It seemed more like an outline or idea for a
movie.; I'm having a hard time putting my finger on what didn't
work with this movie.; From the commercials, it looks like
it's going to be an action-packed adventure, which I think it was
supposed to be.; There was plenty of blood and guts, killings, and  nasty people,
but somehow it just didn't involve me.; It does have
good scenery, but that's about it."
19381.0,Strike!,1998.0,"Not for the
average Jo, but it will tickle the fancy of women liberationists.; So when Miss Goddards preparatory school for girls is being threatened
with the inclusion of boys, the loyalties of a group of close friends
become divided.; So what follows is a high school romp not too dissimilar to the
Hayley Mills classic The Trouble With Angels'.; All very wicked
and light hearted fun.; Juno now offers FREE Internet Access!","It's a shame that their talents are put at the service of such a mawkish
and poorly constructed piece of melodrama.; The love triangle never
catches fire because Jasper never seems a formidable romantic adversary
for Kelley; once that part of the story has long been exhausted, writer
Michael Seitzman and director Mark Piznarski trot in a lame bit of
potential weepiness that is made all the more annoying by its arbitrary
nature.; So when someone aims to do something
different with a youth-targeted film film, as the makers of
_All_I_Wanna_Do_ and _Here_on_Earth_ have, it comes as somewhat of a
relief.; The three leads' impressive work confirms their potential for
major stardom, but _Here_on_Earth_ is far from the vehicle that will put
them over that plateau.; On the other hand, I can't imagine any audience other than weepy girls
falling for the teen tearjerker _Here_on_Earth_."
19382.0,Biloxi Blues,1997.0,"If you liked him in TRUE ROMANCE
(9/10) and AT CLOSE RANGE (7.5/10), you'll love him in this wonderfully
unhinged achievement.; Great line!; BILOXI BLUES is not a great military comedy, but it is probably the
best thing director Mike Nichols has done in quite a long time.; Also, I have always been a fan of epilogues, so I
did enjoy this one as well, but will admit that it did turn out to be a
little too schmaltzy if you really think about it.; The film's greatest virtue is the portrayal of the troubled
     and enigmatic platoon sergeant.","Somehow the last three show very little sign that anyone in their
production knew or cared what army life was about.; The first two may have been written by someone who actually had been in the
military.; Several divergent young
recruits highlight his group of trainees, as well as an abusive drill
sergeant who will stop at nothing to discipline this naïve set of
youths.; The
writer of MR. ROBERTS gave more of an impression of knowing the military.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
19398.0,Simon,1994.0,"Its light tone
is reminiscent of the earlier Woody Allen movies (particularly SLEEPER)
that Brickman had a hand in.; Despite flaws, film still manages many funny moments - a highlight is
Arkin's mime of the evolution of man, excitedly narrated by observing
scientist Wallace Shawn.; Alan
Arkin plays the title character, a college lecturer who has been
selected for an elaborate, if somewhat fey, experiment by Austin
Pendleton's elite scientific task force.; The newly
'alienated' Simon, in like fashion, is interested only in the trivial
aspects of modern life.; Also with: Madeline Kahn
(less kooky than usual), and Judy Graubert as Simon's girlfriend.","It's obvious that writer-director
Brickman wanted to milk as many ideas from this premise as he could.; Along with ALTERED STATES, this uneven comedy by Marshall Brickman
seemed to make 1980 the year for isolation tank experiments.; Instead, the satire becomes muddy.; These scientists, however, are not interested in
major issues - their pursuits are petty or fanciful.; Film's uninspiring title
didn't contribute much to its box-office."
19405.0,Recess: School's Out,2000.0,"(I especially liked that scene, but I was at Berkeley in the 
60s so it brought back good memories.); Make no mistake--this is a film made for the kiddies, and
it's the young 'uns who will take the most from the animated antics.; His buddy Maxim, age 12, gave it **, 
saying that he liked the fighting part the best.; The film is based on a (supposedly) popular
Saturday morning cartoon, and its crew reads like a who's who of smart
animated comedies (director Chuck Sheetz has worked on The Simpsons and King
of the Hill, while writers Joe Ansolabehere, Jonathan Greenberg and Paul
Germain have served time on shows like Daria, Rugrats and Duckman).; On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Recess: School's Out"" is a kid-friendly 5 - and don't miss the psychedelic homage to ""Yellow Submarine,"" called ""Green Tambourine,"" sung by Robert Goulet over the closing credits.","It's harmless enough, but watching a blank wall is also pretty 
benign, so its lack of offensive material hardly serves as a 
recommendation.; Skip the movie.; There's 
not much to laugh at and barely enough material even to keep the viewers 
awake.; If it did, the characters, which are drawn to 
look as flat as paper dolls, would certainly all blow down, leaving us 
with no actors for the story.; Most of the script is as bland as Saturday cartoons, but a few lines are 
good (""Technically, after the completion of fourth grade, we are 
pre-young adults."""
19600.0,Bossa Nova,2001.0,"A very satisfying film about the
possibilities and the joys of love, BOSSA NOVA shows what can happen
when romantic comedies tone down the comedy and accentuate the romance.; Although the
plethora of competing subplots prevents this romance from being anything
but cursorily explored, it is a touching and effective pairing which
makes good use of the skills of both Irving and Fagundes.; A hospital room makes the madcap
resolution a fitting conclusion to a romance that is more
mature, more complex, and with more real atmosphere than
the typical Hollywood production featuring bubbleheaded 20-
somethings.; The contrasting clothes include some of the best
looking, and best tailored, suits that you've ever seen on Pedro and
some of the flashiest silk shirts on Acácio.; The film is in English and in Portuguese with
English subtitles.","But Deodato's compositions are generally
tedious and sleep-inducing, and the music never becomes the crucial
ingredient that the filmmakers seem to be trying to set up.; But even here the movie undercuts
itself: the blouse scene over with, it appears Machado and Young had
little idea what else to do with the concept, and quickly skip to the
inevitable result of Pedro's secretly sending it to Mary Ann.; Indeed,
Deodato's score is perhaps emblematic of ""Bossa Nova"" as a whole -- not
really bad, in fact occasionally alluring, but for the most part simply 
failing to be at all interesting.; Rated R.  Running Time: 95 minutes.; While it's sumptuously photographed by
Pascal Rabaud, it should be paced like a screwball romantic farce,
complete with mistaken identities and comedic confusion, but,
unfortunately, at times it's somewhat stilted."
20287.0,Extreme Prejudice,1996.0,"The cinematography is excellent, the cast of
characters is broad and has texture, the script is quite good, and the film
lets you keep up with what's happening yourself, without spelling it out to
you.; I appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up.; Torn is the
sympathetic figure of the group; he smiles before shooting anyone.; Frankly, this is a pretty good movie, if you can accept the premise and
can take the macho stuff.; In particular, we got Nick Nolte as one
hard-ass Texas Ranger, Powers Boothe as the drug kingpin, Michael Ironsides as
the leader of the secret army, and Rip Torn as the local sheriff.","Warning: anyone offended by blatant, leering machismo had better avoid
this film.; Finally,
there's lots of Sam Peckinpah slow-motion shoot-ups.; Women exist here to look good,
comfort the man, and get argued over.; Gosh!; With a John Milius script!"
20289.0,Rush,1992.0,"Zanuck's strength may be in eliciting controlled performances from
her actors.; It is definitely worth what ever price you pay and will provide you with
almost two hours of pure enjoyment (but be prepared to be sad in some
parts).; The acting in the film is great.; The film shows the
gritty downside to being a undercover narcotics officer, and because of
how well it does this, it makes the film excellent viewing.; Their partnership is outstanding.","One scene in particular was supposed to show
desperation but struck me as downright laughable.; Patric does not play at it, and
his performance is beyond acting.; Why would anyone actually choose to be an undercover narcotics cop?; Considerably less
convincing is Sam Elliott, who always seems to be posing for the
camera.; Sometimes it's hard to know where the director had problems and
where the script fell short."
20306.0,Swimming with Sharks,1981.0,"I recommend it quite highly.; A lot of what makes the film so funny is the excellent cast.; Actually, in that way it reminds me of ""In the Company of
Men"" (an excellent movie, by the way).; Benicio Del 
Toro (""The Usual Suspects"") also makes a brief, but excellent, appearance as 
Buddy's former assistant.; What makes this 
feat even more amazing is that the film is carried by only three actors.","Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be enough material here to satisfy 
a full length feature, and the movie, which starts with such promise, 
begins to drag around its midpoint.; If you can't do that, avoid this 
film like you'd avoid ""Home Alone 4"" (knock on wood that that never comes to 
be).; * * - Pretty bad, see it at your own risk.; First up we have Frank Whaley (""Pulp Fiction""), playing a guy who bounces 
back and forth from being sympathetic, to being flat-out annoying.; This
happens in the first 5 minutes, however -- the whole movie is a flashback."
20455.0,Digimon: The Movie,1997.0,"Most kids have only one, but there's this one kid in Colorado who is the 
lucky owner of two digimon.; Speaking of the POKEMON movies, my wife said that she thought that she 
would never say it, but she found both of the POKEMON movies were 
superior to the DIGIMON one.; My son, however, disagrees, but he'll get 
his chance to chime in at usual spot at the end of the review.; The pace may be quicker and the action louder and more extreme than in
_Pokémon_, but that doesn't necessarily make _Digimon_ better.; Say
what one will about _Pokémon_ poster critter Pikachu, one must concede
that he has personality, and there is some warmth to his relationship
with trainer Ash Ketchum.","In the first half of the film, the bad Digimon is a computer
virus that threatens to wipe out the world's computers, and its up to
Kari's big brother Tai (Joshua Seth), the rest of the DigiDestined, and
their Digimon to save the world.; Why do these Digimon fight?; And the makers of _Digimon:_The_Movie_ don't
skimp, barely taking a breath between action scenes.; Neither this, nor the lackluster music, can compensate for the story's 
confusion.; Finding out where it is 
will be the least of your problems since the movie's plot is about as 
clear as one of those obscure ""illegal instruction"" error message that 
your computer spits at you when it's angry."
20465.0,Stage Fright,2000.0,"This film, the second one Hitchcock has done in England since his return
there from America, is one of the master's most subtle and sharpest
comic efforts.; Stage
Fright is sandwiched in between Hitcock's ""Under Capricorn"" and
""Strangers on a Train"", and is equal to if not better than both.; I simply loved the film, even though I was not crazy about the choice of
Jane Wyman as Eve Gill, the perky heroine who falls in love anew upon
hearing a beautiful piano rendition played by the lead investigator in
the murder case, as she turns her heart over to him from the murder
suspect she was originally pining for.; STAGE FRIGHT (director: Alfred Hitchcock; screenwriter: Whitfield
Cook/Ranald MacDougall/Alma Reville/from a novel ""Man Running"" by Selwyn
Jepson; cinematographer: Wilkie Cooper; editor: E. B. Jarvis; Marlene
Dietrich (Charlotte Inwood), Jane Wyman (Eve Gill), Richard Todd
(Jonathan Cooper), Michael Wilding (Inspector Wilfred Smith), Alastair
Sim (Commodore Gill), Sybil Thorndike (Mrs. Gill), Kay Walsh (Nellie
Goode), Hector MacGregor (Freddie Williams), Joyce Grenfell (Shooting
Gallery Attendant), Ballard Berkeley (Sergeant Mellish), 1950-UK) Stage Fright is a hardly frightening but, nonetheless, laudable movie,
that features Hitchcock's droll humor and his perfection in regards to
set arrangements.; Hitch starts out with the panicky Jonathan Cooper (Todd) telling his
only friend in the world, Eve Gill (Wyman), who is hurriedly driving him
to a hideout because she loves and trusts him, as he tells her how he
has been implicated in a murder.","She is acceptable in this
damsel-in-distress role, but doesn't really sparkle in the role and make
you feel for her, perhaps, like a Grace Kelly would have.; While being Charlotte's dresser, she is convinced she will
exonerate her boyfriend by getting some information on the actress.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; She next connives
Nellie with some money, to say that she is her cousin and will send her
as a replacement maid and dresser to Charlotte for a few days because of
her illness."
20481.0,Nightbreed,1991.0,"Good acting, good directing, excellent
sets; are you getting the idea that I loved this movie?; *Excellent* special effects.; Rachel was also very good.; The special effects -- especially the creature effects -- are outstanding,
and there's also enough gore to satisfy all but the most hard-core of Barker's
fans.; And truth
be known, once the Phantom realized that NIGHTBREED really wasn't in the same
class as the films in the HELLRAISER series, he enjoyed himself immensely.","NIGHTBREED feels choppy and poorly constructed -- almost as if much more
than its running time of about 100 minutes was filmed but then ultimately left
on the cutting room floor.; I felt they could have spent a little more time developing Boone's
character in the beginning of the movie.; And just for the sake of completeness, the Phantom will add that
NIGHTBREED contains some truly awful dialogue.; They
must have spent most of the budget on the creature shop.; People do and say things for no reason or for reasons that are never explained;
the psychiatrist Decker slips in and out of his Mask at random or convenient
times and kills for reasons Barker keeps to himself; and Midian itself comes
across as little more than an underground Sheraton convention center for the
dead, even though in CABAL Barker presented it as the strange and frightening
home of the last of the shapeshifters -- a species neither living nor dead, but
certainly more than just a bunch of monsters sitting around talking."
20697.0,Ready to Rumble,1998.0,"Perfect.; Good: The wrestling scenes were really cool, only I wish they had included
more of them...pretty exciting stuff!; The one thing that has always eluded me with the newest
generation of wrestlers  Goldberg, Sting, Mankind, and The Rock  is
the human element that drew me into the action so well as a kid.; If on the other hand, you
liked Beavis & Butthead, you liked Bill & Ted's, and you liked, well,
Rocky...you will most likely enjoy this passable update of their respective
themes.; Arquette and Caan put out wonderful performances of
simple men looking to fulfill their dreams without anything standing in
their way.","The actors are dull, the script awful, and the plot which there
isn't much of....really annoying.; * - One of the worst movies ever made.; * * - Pretty bad, see it only if you have nothing better to do.; That moment was also, 
calamitously, at the five-minute mark of this overlong, 107-minute waste of 
celluloid.; The
film is a colossal waste of time but, if you insist on going, make sure
you stick around for the outtakes during the closing credits."
20763.0,Radio Flyer,1999.0,"If anything,
this movie does a great disservice to the very serious issue of
child abuse--either physical or mental.; The picture opens with Tom Hanks telling two kids about his life
growing up with his younger brother.; Simultaneously, the younger brother, who is the direct object
of the king's (that is the nickname conferred on the child abuser)
beatings, yearns to convert his 4-wheeled red wagon, called the ""Radio
Flyer"", into an airplane because he wants to fly.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","The only depth to this whole movie is that the kid wants to somehow
build the airplane to fly away from the king's beating.; How can anyone mix
humor with child abuse?; On the other hand,
we see major hints (like a horribly bruised back) of serious
child abuse.; From the adult perspective, this was a pointless picture that
is worth about 0.5 star out of 4.; The whole action is just his
crying out to escape the pain, from which he really can't escape (at
least not until the king is thrown in jail)."
20770.0,But I'm a Cheerleader,1960.0,"It's
hilarious.; The first time we see the True Direction outfits -- shocking pink for
the girls and iridescent blue for the boys -- they are funny.; ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" shows the influence of the
eminent John Waters on Ms. Babbitt, who even uses a
Waters favorite, Mink Stole, in the role of an Edith Bunker-
like parent.; Still, it's wacky fun, and spiced with loose lips and one-liners
that'll more often than not crack up the crowd.; Soon
Megan is deep into the five-step program, but she also finds herself
interested in a surly fellow ""patient"" named Graham (Clea DuVall) --
interested in an unnatural, unhealthy desire sort of way.","The
irritations of a film like THE REPLACEMENTS are far more mundane by
comparison-you know that it will be at best a tolerable audience-friendly
mediocrity, at worst a bland, pressed and processed Entertainment 
McNugget.; It was painful to watch this kind of kitsch for 80
or so minutes, which seemed to drag on for a hellish eternity.; BUT I'M
A CHEERLEADER might never have been riotously funny as the silly spoof it
initially appears to be, but at least it might have felt consistent.; Unfortunately, first-time feature director Jamie Babbit (whose few
credits including directing the MTV series ""Undressed"" and acting as
script supervisor on The Game) doesn't appear to have much ability
behind the camera, which becomes painfully apparent after only a few
minutes.; ---A copy of this review can be found at
http://www.moviereviews.org/but_i'm_a_cheerleader.htm --- `But I'm a Cheerleader' so profusely exaggerates its entire premise that the
picture crosses the line from being merely satirical of an already
much-satirized society to being downright stupid."
20859.0,Blown Away,1997.0,"If you are from
Boston, you will love the many nice scenes shot on location there.; Jeff
Bridges is the most brilliant and daring member of the Boston bomb
squad, but he is a burn out case who is retiring.; Jeff Bridges is especially good at this.; It's a little slow by action picture
standards, but in comparison to its forerunner, it's an absolute drag.; It's funny how films of the same type get released so closely together.","Badly written plot and badly written characters are
sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all.; The
most annoying element of the film, however, is Tommy Lee
Jones in the role of mad bomber.; It doesn't work.; But the production
just isn't lean enough to sustain that energy.; He's just plain weird, bouncing on beds and making bizarre
videotapes, but for all his supposed cock-eyed creativity he never
comes off as smart enough to be genuinely threatening."
20927.0,Bed of Roses,1996.0,"Slater gives a genuinely tender
and touching one.; Nevertheless, this is one very
romantic movie.; She delivers a
compelling and complex performance.; Voon As modern Fairy-tales go this is pleasantly enchanting.; It is a movie that promises much more
than it delivers, and yet it is a touching and romantic fable that
lifts your heart before it makes a fast exit for reasons that baffle
me.","It is not that the last third of the movie is bad,
it just does not exist at all!; Better, however, for BED 
OF ROSES to be overambitious than for it to ""dumb up"" its script.; It is rated PG for
a couple of bad words.; I could not figure out if
the writer ran out of ideas or what.; For whatever reason, the producers (Michael Haley, Allan
Mindel, and Denise Shaw) should have demanded the script be finished
properly before they released the film."
20978.0,My Father the Hero,1999.0,"Starring:  Gerard Depardieu, Katherine Heigl, Dalton James, 
           Lauren Hutton, Faith Prince
Director:  Steve Miner
Producers:  Jacques Bar and Jean-Louis Livi
Screenplay:  Francis Verber and Charlie Peters based on MON PERE,
             CE HEROS by Gerard Lauzier
Music:  David Newman
Released by Touchstone Pictures Gerard Depardieu's interpretation of Cyrano De Bergerac was a
definitive character in modern cinema, not to mention a jewel in the
crown of his career.; But it is enjoyable, if not an ego acting showcase for Gerard
Depardieu, who is good.; Gerard Depardieu is fun
to watch, and proves surprisingly adept at physical comedy.; Starring:  Gerard Depardieu, Katherine Heigl, Dalton James, Faith Prince.; Depardieu has a pleasant
rapport with Katherine Heigl, and with a flirtatious tourist played by
Faith Prince.","Instead
of going for outright zaniness, the film attempts to stay within the
bounds of ""good taste"" and family values (in spite of the obvious
Oedipal inklings), which not only dilutes the humor but results in an
unwatchable climax involving a water rescue.; It would be one thing if MY FATHER THE HERO were simply
predictable, which it is, but it is also just badly written.; The
lies are just a device, and even if we believe it's just adolescence at
work there's no particular reason to care.; There are serious
issues bubbling away here that the movie doesn't know how to properly
address, attempting instead to turn them into fodder for humor.; For some odd reason, it just doesn't have the same impact."
20992.0,Brother,1998.0,"BROTHER is a breathtakingly beautiful but graphically violent film that isn't
for everyone.; The first American film by writer, director, editor and star Takeshi Kitano, an
enormously popular Japanese version of Clint Eastwood, BROTHER could be referred
to as THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE GUNNER.; The difference is that BROTHER is more violent, much classier and
absolutely fascinating.; The film is in English and in Japanese with English
subtitles.; After a war breaks out between
two Japanese Mafia families, Yamamoto ends up with a Mafia death sentence
hanging over him.","With his pensive stare, his
slight facial twitch and his droll, macabre humor, Yamamoto is a walking time
bomb that explodes at random intervals.; My son Jeffrey, age 12, gave it just one *, saying that it was a bloodbath
without a plot.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; This is
completely unacceptable to Yamamoto, who almost single-handedly gets his brother
and his buddies to the top of the gangster chart.; Just send me a letter with the word ""subscribe"" in the subject line."
21056.0,Big Eden,1994.0,"The cynics, of course, will argue that 
such rampant humanitarianism makes it all a fairy tale, but I found it 
touching and believable from beginning to end.; Both actors turn in nicely nuanced and 
compelling performances.; In the paradise of
Big Eden, what you are doesn't matter as much as generosity of spirit, respect
and kindness.; And Rob Sweeney's photography of Glacier National
Park is spectacular!; This fable about home and family is a major debut for first-time
film-maker Thomas Bezucha (a former designer for Coach and Polo/Ralph Lauren)
who is meticulous about minding details, using ballads like ""Welcome to my
World"" and ""Achin', Breakin' Heart"" to set up the concept of our universal
longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved.","Eden
is nothing more than a small-town gay love triangle with no antagonist and
very little conflict.; Pike can't even make eye
contact with Henry, which mistakenly comes off as rude behavior.; Aside from the gay angle,
Eden is a formulaic mess.; Besides the breathtaking scenery and another
chance to see Louise Fletcher teamed up with a really tall Indian (a la One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest), Eden is only interesting for the fact its star
plays a character that's returning to his hometown...not unlike Gross'
former television co-star Ellen DeGeneres, whose new show is about the same
thing.; It is rated PG-13 for some mature thematic material 
and would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up."
21202.0,Madame Butterfly,1997.0,"This Madame Butterfly is a great movie.; Puccini's opera has never had a more beautiful, more loving, more
touching production than Martin Scorsese's presentation, directed by
Frederic Mitterand.; The story is set in Nagasaki, Japan in 1904, and it is a simple
tale.; At first 
glance, it might seem odd, but, as brought to the screen by first time 
feature director Frederic Mitterrand, this adaptation of Giacomo 
Puccini's classic MADAME BUTTERFLY is electric.; It is in Italian with English
subtitles.","I can not
recommend this tepid attempt at turning an opera into a movie.; My biggest problem with the movie is the staging.; The singers he chose have modest voices with
little resonance or interest.; The
singers in this film have minuscule acting ability so they bring little
to their roles to compel the audience's attention.; Being a big opera buff, I can testify that opera is one of God's
gifts to mankind, but as in all things, there are bad examples."
21252.0,Nil by Mouth,1998.0,"I sure was, but Clapton has
done a terrific job with a subtly jazzy score that fitted the film very well.; She imbues Valerie 
with a quiet dignity that is evident from the first time we see her.; Oldman does an excellent job of bringing the audience into a world 
where despair and hopelessness are the norm.; Oldman has based this bleak, gritty tale on his memories of growing 
up in the economically deprived projects of South London.; The film's treatment of 
Valerie is equally well-rounded and believable.","No flashy loud camera work (Albino Alligator), no overpriced
contrived production values (Braveheart) and no heavy handed ludicrous
symbolism (Dead Man Walking).; However, overlong, tedious, plotless,
and dragged-out apply as well.; Now, I have nothing against plotless films
(witness my love of the films of Kevin Smith) but scene after scene of
absolutely nothing passing itself off as Something Important was just too
much for me.; This latter deficiency is on
display particularly in the opening half-hour, in which Oldman
wants to impress on every member of the audience the
ambiance of the South London district of his childhood.; -Robert Bresson, Notes on the Cinematographer There seems to be a general disaster zone that the majority of
actors-turned-directors wander into."
21309.0,River's Edge,1995.0,"Subdued photography
by Frederick Elmes and score by Jurgen Knieper maintain a cool,
barren, neutral atmosphere.; Ironically, the only member of the group to get worked up about the
incident (Crispin Glover) has sympathies that lie not with their dead
schoolmate but with her killer.; It's not difficult to see these characters
still living in their town twenty years in the future.; Certainly
that's the case for Hopper's Feck, who has spent twenty years isolated
inside his own house - it's he and Glover who steal the show and
provide the most eccentric moments in the film.; His
high-school friends, including Matt (Keanu Reeves) and Clarissa (Ione
Skye Leitch) find out, but their reaction is largely unemotional.","Moody film by director Tim Hunter and scriptwriter Neal Jiminez has an
unsettling premise, but is populated with characters that are so
dysfunctional they'll have you shaking your head in distanced
amusement.; Story has serious societal
comment interspersed with black comedy: a teenager (Daniel Roebuck)
kills his girlfriend and leaves her corpse on the river bank.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; But maybe that's the point.; It's a generation gap exemplified by
Reeves' family, none of whom understand each other, all of whom ignore
each other."
21349.0,Anywhere But Here,1994.0,"Both Sarandon and Portman give very good, precise performances.; It's a touching and funny tale for anyone who's been in a situation
resembling the emotional challenge that Ann and Adele are facing.; Sarandon is astonishing as her eccentric, charismatic character, as she
convinces you of her deep, impassioned love for her daughter, and lets you feel
the fact that Adele may seem over the top, or a little nuts at times, but she
just doesn't want to let go.; But I was pleasantly surprised with Natalie Portman.; Corbin Allred is charismatic, funny, and virtuous as Peter, and 
works well with Portman.","But the worst failing of ANYWHERE BUT HERE is the utter lack of any
sort of plot.; ANYWHERE BUT HERE is so bad that if I wasn't a film critic, I would
have left the theater in the first 45 minutes.; This was
just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater
where this film is showing.; I mean, what is this movie supposed to be about?; For two hours, we drag through one boring and random
tragedy after another."
21352.0,Andre,,"Those with children can feel confident that ANDRE will present an
enjoyable ninety-six minutes for their offspring.; The villains are suitably nasty, the heroes are
nicely heroic and, of course, the seal is cute and funny.; ANDRE is a kid's show based on a true story.; Other than the obligatory, lets make them think someone is
going to die scenes, it is a sugary sweet show.; It
will be well written and carefully paged all the way to the end, not leaving
many unanswered questions.","On a strictly clinical level,
it really isn't very good--the cliche-riddled plot is hopelessly
predictable, the characters are broadly realized, and the acting is
merely serviceable.; There's a lot of
saccharine here--perhaps too much for the ""intellectual"" movie-goer.; She's an appealing performer who shows promise, but she
still has some rough edges to file down.; The MPAA rates it PG for reasons that
totally escape me.; Some might argue that
there's a little more to this film than that, but all of the peripheral
stuff is only so much excess baggage."
21355.0,All the Pretty Horses,2000.0,"What suffers most is a romance between cowpoke John Grady Cole (Matt
Damon) and Alejandro (Penelope Cruz), the daughter of a powerful
rancher.; After his
harrowing experience in Mexico, which left him scarred, Matt Damon feels
so comfortable with the Texas judicial system, that he has a
heart-to-heart talk with a kind-hearted judge (Dern).; veteran Thomas is quite strong as Lacey, Cole's pragmatic, but
good-humored buddy.; Together, they make a great team.; Join Juno today!","Basically, none of the characters - except Miriam
Colon's - exude passion or even interest.; Unfortunately, however, what is intended to be art is just
another horse opera made in an understated and
underproduced manner to give the viewer the impression that
he is looking at virtuosity.; There might have been a good picture in this tale, but it just never
kicked in.; Fully 45 minutes pass before anything of 
consequence happens, and, even then, it is nothing memorable.; But no sooner have 
we hoped that this thread to the story will take off than it is dropped 
like a hot potato."
21450.0,Naked,1987.0,"NAKED is one of those rare, powerful motion pictures that refuses
to slip easily from memory.; This film is brutal and raw, and its
sense of humor comes with a serrated edge.; Those in search of escapism should not
look to this motion picture, but anyone willing to assume the risk of
facing the ugliness of Johnny's world will find a startling,
gut-wrenching, eye-opening film.; Its images and themes linger long after
the viewer has left the theater, and the most stark of these are
commonly the most disturbing.; Mike Leigh has always been known as a creator of exceptional,
insightful character studies.","He's not particularly choosey about his listeners, entering
into conversations with the vacuous Sophie, a middle-class guard named
Brian (Peter Wight), a lonely woman who he initially observes from afar
through a window, and a man putting up posters.; However, whereas comedies such
as LIFE IS SWEET and HIGH HOPES showed Mr. Leigh's whimsical side,
NAKED is anything but charming.; Their reunion is
less-than-affectionate, and propels Johnny into a violent and
self-destructive sexual relationship with Louise's flatmate Sophie
(Katrin Cartlidge).; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
21661.0,Air Bud: Golden Receiver,1999.0,"It's refreshing, by the way, that Bud likes him back 
- a turnaround from many family pets' uncanny instincts and hatred of a 
human character.; More than a comedy, it was a touching 
little film with some very sweet scenes.; One 
part of the movie that is refreshing, albeit not especially believable, 
is that the coach isn't really interested very much in winning.; Cynthia Stevenson turns in a credible performance as Jackie.; With a quick opening that does its job - 
moving fast and reinforcing Bud's craftiness and basketball expertise --  
the story unfolds easily and reintroduces us to Josh Framm (Kevin 
Zegers), now an eighth grader, and his mother Jackie (Cynthia 
Stevenson).","Of all the ridiculous subplots, the one of the stupid Russian 
animalnappers is the worst.; Subject any wild child to 90 minutes of this charmless,
preachy and flabbergastingly dull excuse for a movie and the kid will
promise you anything in exchange for directions to the door.; But this sight gag is not 
enough to sustain a full-length movie.; Are a couple of 
shots of  Josh's deceased test-pilot father enough to make us believe 
Josh's motivation to act like he does?; From moment to moment, it's hard to tell
whether AIR BUD: GOLDEN RECEIVER is supposed to be an Afterschool Special,
a John Hughes film or an episode of Rocky and Bullwinkle (though with
considerably less wit)."
21811.0,Ski School,2000.0,"Like most B movies,
some of the cast really stand out.; Those of you who enjoy films like THE NAKED GUN 2
1/2: THE SMELL OF FEAR will probably find this film worth watching,
once.; Mixed in the battle are the new recruits.; SKI SCHOOL is done by Moviestore Entertainment and distributed by
HBO home video.; These two deserve more than what this film ended up being.","In this film there are two, Charlie
Spradling and the guy who looks and sounds like Rob Scheider of
""Saturday Night Live"" (sorry, I couldn't figure out which one he was).; On a scale of zero to five, I give SKI SCHOOL a three.; Too often the joke gets lost along the way, or
the joke gets changed and is no longer funny.; Then again, if I had seen the Moviestore Entertainment
name on the videocassette box, based on my past experiences with their
films, my expectations would not have been so high.; Although this film
seems to try hard, it is inconsistently funny and only worth watching
for below $1.50."
21991.0,State and Main,1998.0,"with perfect aplomb.; The best story line also happens to include the
two best actors in the picture -- Hoffman and Pidgeon -- who find
themselves in the most peculiar -- and believable -- romance I think
I've ever seen on screen or off.; As both writer and
director, Mamet keeps masterful control over when information is revealed,
adding layers of humor at unexpected moments.; Mamet's dialog is well-delivered if not
entirely realistic and believable.; He meets local bookshop owner Ann Black
(Rebecca Pidgeon, ""The Winslow Boy"" and Mamet's wife) who tries to keep him
on a true course as he navigates the ways of Tinseltown while an innocent
romance blooms.","about that horrid waste of actors and celluloid, SUPERNOVA?; Unfortunately, the 
execution of these amusing ideas falls flat with too much going on with too 
many characters.; My bad.; Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, vacillates between robotic and just plain terrible, 
as always--she has the glassy-eyed stare of someone being fed her lines 
off-screen.; For a movie about making a movie, there isn't enough movie-making 
stuff to the story."
22010.0,Grass,1995.0,"Some of the best moments of the film are the official truths of 
the time.; Hypocrisy is present on both sides of the argument.; The truth, as issued by the government and accepted by non-users, 
flashes before each decade.; It seems Grass covers only the periods where 
people lived in ignorance about the downsides from using the drug.; The previous inquiry morphs into different forms as 
time and the film go on.","This picture certainly does not break any new ground, and 
rarely rises above the amusing level.; Unless you can personally relate to Grass's subject, it is likely to have 
little impact.; Grass is essentially a piece of harmless propaganda.; Whenever a law passes 
that is against marijuana, a disaster diagram (erupting volcanoes, spinning 
tornadoes, etc.); If it were more thought provoking than 
rebellious, it would be much better."
22067.0,Jason's Lyric,1999.0,"All in all, JASON'S LYRIC
represents failed yet refreshing experiment that
nevertheless can be seen as a decent film of its own.; JASON'S LYRIC lives up to that limited vision, encasing its actors in
all too-familiar roles.; But the concern for his brother and
memories of tragic childhood incident involving his drunken
father Maddog (played by Forest Whitaker) is going to stop
him until it is too late.; Jason's life begins to change after he meets beautiful girl
Lyric (played by Jada Pinkett) and starts romantic
relationship with her.; This is quite an interesting approach,
especially for the often misogynist black ghetto sub-genre.","Another idea
- to give some biblical overtones to the script via Cain vs.
Abel story - is also compromised with the heavy-handed
approach.; George McHenry isn't depraved enough to show a son giving his
father uncut heroin to shoot up, but that's about all that separates
his directorial debut JASON'S LYRIC from being as twisted as this
year's earlier entry in the inner city black pathology sweepstakes,
SUGAR HILL.; Instead, McHenry pushes him into an undisciplined, boozy incoherence
that overshoots sentimentality and lands squarely on embarrassment.; Like SUGAR HILL, JASON'S LYRIC is another lazy retelling of the
Cain and Abel myth.; Ironically, the best of the three leads, Jada Pinkett, fares the
worst, because she's a prep-school brotha's wet-dream and an intelligent
knockout who spreads her legs on date number three--and nothing more."
22189.0,Havana,1996.0,"Alan Arkin does an excellent job as
Redford's friend, a casino manager with no illusions about what's
coming.; The film does a good job of contrasting
the decadence of the city with the war in the countryside and the
brutality of the secret police that underlies everyday life.; The husband of the Olin
character, played by Raul Julia in an uncredited role (due to a dispute
over the billing to which Julia was entitled) is good in the Paul
Henried part, and the actor who plays the chief of police (whose name I
didn't catch) is also good.; The supporting cast is good.; But the Batista government is on its last
legs, the rebels are about to win, and the revolution ultimately upsets
Redford's plans for both Olin and the score.","In the scenes without Olin, Redford pulls this off
fairly well, but when he has to be tender with Olin it just seems lame
and out of character.; Much of that humungous budget went into creating the look
and feel of Havana of 1958.; The conclusion contains some
rather incoherent events relating to the CIA's involvement in Batista's
government, which I felt blunted the impact of the film (the
incoherence, that is, not the presence of the CIA itself).; You should not put all your money on one number.; Or another example: Hollywood should bet on a bankable combination
like Sidney Pollack directing Robert Redford in films like THE WAY WE WERE,
THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, ELECTRIC HORSEMAN, and OUT OF AFRICA."
22213.0,Boiling Point,1998.0,"Unlike many films that focus on con artists and their scams,
BOILING POINT only presents a few run-of-the mill capers.; BOILING POINT is based on the novel MONEY MEN, which in turn is
based on a true story.; Having
said that, it also features a slick Wesley Snipes acting like a bad-ass
while chomping on a cigar every chance he gets, one of Viggo Mortensen's
earlier and less subdued roles, and an overall decent noirish time if you
happen to catch it on video.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; We keep
expecting Red to come up with something brilliant, but the ""card up his
sleeve"" is one that we learn about early--that he's leading Ronnie on
while training him to be his assassin.","CRITIQUE:
This film includes some pretty bad acting, little to no action, a ""Miami
Vice"" leftover script, and Dennis Hopper acting with his red hair.; Is it all together boring?; It's as mediocre a movie as there ever has been, with very
little to like or despise.; Is it all pretty predictable?; He doesn't even like carrying a gun."
22256.0,Without Limits,1999.0,"Containing an intense performance by Billy Crudup as Pre and an
Oscar-worthy one by Donald Sutherland as Bill Bowerman, Pre's coach at
the University of Oregon, WITHOUT LIMITS is one of the best sports
movies in quite a while and is worth seeing, whether you are a sports
fan or not.; The most fascinating part of Without Limits centres on the
complex and volatile relationship between the cocky, arrogant and
strong willed Prefontaine and his brilliant coach and mentor Bill
Bowerman (Donald Sutherland).; The ubiquitous Matthew Lillard makes an appearance as one of
Prefontaine's team mates, but the acting award goes to a magical performance
by the ever reliable Donald Sutherland.; The
performances are top-notch, with Crudup giving a star-making performance
as the doomed athelete.; Sutherland is at his best (you know his great acting like in
Ordinary People (1980) that won 4 Oscars).","Whether this was the filmmakers' intent, or just the result of
some sloppy editing, the result is a vague outline of the events in
Pre's life, rather than a clear picture.; He didn't do enough to fill a two-hour running
time.; Monica Potter is the only weak link in the cast.; His college romance with writer Mary Marckx
(Monica Potter, from Patch Adams, etc) is the least interesting
element of the film.; (Director Steve James's trite PREFONTAINE, from early last
year, was not very good when evaluated on its own merits, and it suffers
dramatically when compared to WITHOUT LIMITS.)"
22317.0,Lightning Jack,1999.0,"Besides that, anyone having seen the theatrical trailer has
seen nearly every moment worth seeing.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Riding into Junction City come the legendary Younger Gang, ready
to rob the bank.; Paul Hogan plays Jack Kane like his most famous creation,
Crocodile Dundee, thrown into a time warp.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","The laughs--which are supposed to be the
payoff--are occasionally amusing, but there's far too much dead air in
between.; Trying to plumb it
once too often has resulted in a series of poorly-written,
mostly-unfunny motion pictures that the viewing public as a whole does
not deserve to be subjected to.; There are numerous
examples of movies without a plot or a point, but few are as dull and
meandering as this one.; If he was
hoping to resuscitate an image battered by a pair of awful films
(DUNDEE II and ALMOST AN ANGEL), LIGHTNING JACK isn't likely to do it.; With his name in the slots of co-producer, writer, and
star, Mr. Hogan can hardly be absolved from this travesty."
22345.0,Baby Geniuses,1997.0,"But Elena's plans begin to unravel.; Sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several
security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics.; The
tykes effortlessly combine brawn and brain, and they also perform
complex martial arts and dance floor moves with remarkable ease.; Sly dives into the pram,
surprising the little beauty.; Inevitably, the babies meet - at a shopping mall at
Christmastime - and, in a mistaken-identity switch, they find
themselves in each other's environment.","Anything to avoid this painful movie.; Then again, I don't
suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking
incredibly stupid.; The writing behind this project is embarrassing.; Cute but cloying - unless you're
really into watching the screen antics of two-year olds.; ""Geniuses"" shares with most of Clark's other films an utter
lack of taste and a genuinely ugly look; not only is the movie less
funny than a case of diaper rash, it's even less picturesque."
22423.0,Guilty by Suspicion,1999.0,"Irwin Winkler's GUILTY BY SUSPICION, based on his own script, is a very
realistic and at the same time subdued portrait of a blacklisted film
director.; It is possible to make a film about a subject that is
realistic and at the same time does a disservice by being so realistic.; The film builds to his
eventual hearing with HUAC.; An artist painting a picture has the option of reproducing exactly what
the eye sees or of distorting reality to reach a deeper truth.; For refusing to draw others
into the net, he finds himself blacklisted.","after a pathetic binge.; DeNiro's character is
weak and indecisive and spending so much time showing him not finding work
just does not grab the audience the way it could.; He is willing to cooperate until he is required to
start by giving names of involved associates.; What kind of an example must they
set for their child; two single adults living together outside the
bounds of matrimony!; What follows is a long and not entirely interesting siege
of unemployment seasoned with FBI harassment."
22455.0,Body Melt,1996.0,"Back in suburbia, it seems (set warm grandmotherly tone to ON) that 
nice Lisa McCune is playing a young pregnant wife.; ""Body Melt"" does 
feature a lot of Australian soapie stars in it, which provides some 
vicarious pleasure.; Presumably it 
is within these dimensions that it is possible to understand what this 
movie is about.; [*/misfire] and ""The 
Young Doctors"" on the Sid and Nancy scale.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Moral: it's 
easy for a deliberately bad film to be just bad.; But though its heart is in the right place, ""Body Melt"" really doesn't 
have the Jacksonian stroke of genius or even enough of anything else 
to fill its (barely longer than one hour) running time.; The 
pulsing electronic music and some moments of direction (particularly 
in the opening credits) are certainly well done, but don't make up for 
plot idiocies and the terribly banal dialogue.; It's gross, it's tacky, it's cheap.; Cue the sartorially challenged police 
pathologist, who after some ferocious overacting examines the corpse 
and goggles, ""He's healthy - too healthy!""."
22617.0,Dinner Rush,1999.0,"You can tell the
film is a labor of love, just like Big Night, and it stands a chance at
making you nearly as hungry, even though its story isn't quite as based in
food and its preparation.; As
usual, Gigino is packed full of hungry customers, including Black and Blue,
who may or may not be there to rub Louis out.; The young man will not be satisfied until
his dad makes him an equal partner, but Louis is stringing the kid
along.; Surprisingly, Bob Giraldi, though considered a new director--
who had his film exhibited as such in the New Directors/New
Films series of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and of New
York's MOMA--turns out some cinema as tempting and delicious
as the prize creation of a master chef de cuisine.; Giraldi wisely avoids a conventional, tightly woven narrative tale
in favor of a looser structure, setting cameraman Tim Ives from
table to table, from bathroom to back room, giving us a pointillist's
point of view of what really goes on in those chic places that
people patronize not so much for the food as for the show.","Either your mouth will water so much from the marvelous
exhibition of foods in the kitchen of a Tribeca establishment or
you'll be convinced that these overpriced mess halls are nothing
but palaces of snobbery and pretention.; Meanwhile, Gigino's drink-slinger (Jamie Harris, Fast Food Fast Women)
amazes everyone at the bar (including a Wall Street trader played by Sex and
the City's John Corbett).; Not Rated.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
22621.0,Heavy,1995.0,"This is a very precisely directed film and it has many very nice
subtle touches.; Mangold captures the nuances of life 
perfectly, and, by never cheapening his vision through facile 
resolutions, he fashions a memorable cinematic portrait.; Liv Tyler also gives a very impressive performance
as the young Callie, a difficult role which shows that she has alot of talent 
and Shelley Winters is a delight as Victor's mother.; It may, for some viewers, feel a bit heavy and in need
of some pruning, but on second thought, the same viewers might realize
that the length (not excessive by today's standards) allows the movie to
develop, so that several poignant, even heart-breaking passages
(Victor's mostly) can affect us as they do.; This indie film is filled with many gratifying small touches,
as it takes its time developing and forces one to tune into the way
Victor sees things.","With
typical restraint, the film does not make a big show of this.; Her boyfriend is a handsome but obnoxious
garage mechanic and a guitar-strumming jerk (Evan Dando-lead singer of
the Lemonheads), who wants to control her and doesn't want her working
in the pizza place.; The root of the trouble is more likely that Victor's poundage --tough
the man is far from  a monster of obesity --weighs heavy on his mind,
especially as he can't help eating  high-fat and junk foods.; On the way out of the theater, I heard someone remark, ""Why 
did I just sit through that film?; Editing,Meg Reticker."
22625.0,Circle of Friends,1996.0,"One refreshing aspect of the film is the very realistic way that
religion is included as a major factor in the characters' lives.; It is rare today that a film treats
religious values as a subject worthy of thoughtful discussion.; She was a character
I'm glad I got to know.; CIRCLE OF FRIENDS is a small, pleasant film with some very
thoughtful and intelligent dialog and a tremendously good lead
performance by Minnie Driver.; There are definite parallels to the part
Toni Collette played in Muriel's Wedding which was released in the US
about the same time.","The writer (Andrew Davies) took no risks, and the result is
a completely predictable plot.; Even Driver can't lift the picture out of the hackneyed dilemmas
of the 1950s.; The big mistake is making
Sean into an >obvious< villain in the film.; CIRCLE OF FRIENDS has none of these
qualities, and stands as an example of how to mire a solid cast in a
morass of mediocrity.; From that point on, the movie becomes distressingly 
predictable, with nary a surprise to be found."
22828.0,Homicide,1994.0,"The criminally underrated HOMICIDE is one of David Mamet's best movies.; Mamet shows great skill in this genre.; Mamet's story is an amazing orchestration of smoke and mirrors.; Mantegna has earned directors' and audiences' respect in a long string
of solid performances, including Woody Allen's ALICE, Francis Ford
Coppola's THE GODFATHER III, and (reportedly) Barry Levinson's BUGSY
(which will be opening soon in the Seattle area).; There is a lot to this film.","""Homicide"" suffers from one of the worst cases of cinematic schizophrenia
I've ever seen.; And if the film had not already
descended on a major tangent, it continues to skew as Gold seems to drop
everything to get some kind of revenge, and even this act doesn't make much
sense.; A sub-plot of another
possible hate crime begins to form, and although some attempt is made to
resolve it, nothing seems to exist for a reason.; There might be a revenge plot going on against the
gunrunners that would explain the murder.; We get scenes of soul searching disguised as detective
work, but nothing seems to be adding up to anything."
23210.0,Six Degrees of Separation,2000.0,"Great gags, great
lines, and a cast that's perfect.; My favorite has to do with what to give rich people
and how simple it is.; While the overall theme is lost in the movie, it is a
great evening of entertainment and a chance to see some of the greatest actors
in Hollywood.; SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION provides some very funny
human comedy in an extremely well-constructed story.; Will Smith shows that he is a wonderful actor.","Will Smith's genteel Paul Poitier persona seems too forced and
phony for anyone to accept, even the star-struck Kitteredges, and the
problem is that he's giving a big, broad performance much better suited
to the stage.; I think that credibility is
not the point here.; Not only does it lack the depth and
sparkle of what came before, but its attempt to hammer home a message
already delivered seems unnecessary and tedious.; Will
Smith is actually fairly charismatic as Paul, but the characters played by
Channing, Sutherland, Ian McKellan, Mary Beth Hurt, Bruce Davison, Richard
Masur, and Anthony Michael Hall are all quickly forgettable as indeed John
Guare's screenplay based on his Broadway play would have them be.; However, its
rapid-fire dialogue and exaggerated acting will strike those unfamiliar
with live theater as too stylized and unrealistic."
23535.0,Class of 1999,1990.0,"CLASS OF 1984 wasn't a great film, but it was a lot of fun.; By the film's end, we're just
biding our time until the teachers can all be exterminated by the rival
gangs of students (who have, in a wonderful moment of classic film
cliche, shook hands and joined to fight their common enemy).; But CLASS
OF 1999 is worth seeing once the hoopla of the summer's releases fade
and fall is once again upon us.; Unfortunately, although both
ROBOCOP and THE TERMINATOR deal with future technology and specifically
with androids and how they interact with people, they're fundamentally
different films.; We've seen it all before, but while obviousness is a serious
drawback in other genres, it is sometimes a distinct plus when it comes
to horror films.","It's
very important that you try to remember...""  But instead of expanding on
this idea (furthering the already outrageous joke by making the teachers
inhuman robots), Lester decides to go the TERMINATOR route and turn
CLASS OF 1999 into a bad remake of that hunt-and-destroy classic.; Instead, he chickens out and turns CLASS OF 1999 into a
TERMINATOR clone about half way through.; Things get so bad in
the schools they have to hire androids to teach, but they lose control
of them and...""  The Phantom was disappointed that the print ads didn't
feature an original slogan like ""Meet the future of classroom
instruction,"" though perhaps the fear of litigation stifled the
producers' creative impulses.; Instead, it winds up as another candidate for our ever-expanding
""half-film festival.""; Still, how can you not enjoy seeing an android teacher approach an
unruly student and go through a menu of possible responses in his
heads-up display [ (1) educate, (2) reprimand, (3) discipline ]?"
23655.0,Groove,1999.0,"Watching the
DJs (all real-life rave disc jockeys) interact with the (teensy) crowd
is probably the most fun there is to have in the movie.; Though the ecstatic group bounce to the music of 25 artists
on display while psychedelic decor brings back memories of
the sixties, we get to know some of these fellows as
individuals.; This is an electronic Now Generation from their
means of communication to their music.; While Groove - the story is pretty limp, Groove - the slice of life
examining today's counterculture is far better realized.; ""For the nod,"" he
insists....for the thank-you's, the handshakes he gets from the
guys who sincerely appreciate what he is doing for them.","The acting is
servicable at best, the characterizations not even that.; It is rated R for drug use, language and brief
sexuality and would be acceptable for college students, although I would
not suggest that anyone waste their time on this piece of drivel.; No, it's worse than 90210.; After all, if drugs are this boring, why would anyone buy them.; Worse still
is the contrived drama in the relationship between Colin and Harmony,
which takes a ""hip,"" independent film sort of turn for the worse."
23685.0,Monkeybone,1997.0,"It's a hauntingly delightful creation.; Rose McGowan does a sweet turn as Kitty, Stu's helper 
in the demented Downtown.; It's a visually stunning dimension with
it's unusual inhabitants lifted from the world of Star
Wars, including a bulbous Cyclops, a Bee lady, a
humanoid kitty, and Downtown's leader who resembles a
Satyr.; The standout performance is the voice of Nick Turturro as Monkey 
Bone himself, he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film 
from being a total bust.; Making 
a new friend Kitty (Rose McGowan) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from 
Death, he can go back up and live his life.","Bridget Fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a 
screeching halt, her performance is bad and she seems miscast.; For those curious however, it might be worth 
the rental, but other than that avoid this one.; Special F/X, alone, do not make a movie.; ""Monkeybone"" is a very bad movie, and amazingly so.; A tragic waste of talent 
and incredible visual effects."
23945.0,Carpool,1998.0,"Keep in mind that
the film's producer, Arnon Milchan, has produced some of the best films in
the last fifteen years, such as ""The King of Comedy"", ""JFK"", and ""Falling
Down"".; With such experience, these men know exactly what makes a movie
great.; The man who
directed the hilarious Alan Arkin/Peter Falk comedy ""The In-Laws"" and also
such acclaimed films as ""Love Story"" and ""The Hospital"".; One-by-one, he picks up his 
five passengers, but, because nobody had breakfast, Daniel has to stop 
at the local supermarket to buy some donuts.; So, during 
the course of their flight from a couple of incompetent cops (Kim Coates 
and Rhea Perlman), Franklin and Daniel bond, and the repressed father 
learns to let loose and have fun.","The movie is bad, the endings are
terrible, and, after a mere ten minutes of screen time, Mr. Steiger has
managed to sink even lower than his Cuban- accented turn in the stinky
SPECIALIST.; Things might have been okay if this film had gone someplace, 
anyplace, but it stalls early, then coasts through an hour of minimally-
amusing material before screeching to an amazingly improbable stop.; Ninety minutes stuck 
in a minivan with Tom Arnold, David Paymer, and five annoying kids is 
not my idea of a fun time at the movies.; And the worst thing about the film,
regardless of what kinds of jokes there are, they just aren't funny, no
matter how old you are.; Which is why it's so shocking that ""Carpool"" is a truly horrible
mess."
23949.0,Tape,1918.0,"Are you familiar with the song, ""Friendship, friendship,/ Just a
perfect blendship,/ When other friendships have been forgot,/
Ours will still be hot""?; (While Thurman's performance is good, the trio need to watch Brad
Anderson's Session 9 for a good example of subtle acting on video.); While Vince, an unsuccessful, callow
adult who is a low-level drug dealer and volunteer firefighter is
full of off-the-wall physical activity, John is still pretty much the
shy goody-two-shoes he was in his high school days.; Both men are flawed characters.; Adapted from his one act play by Stephen Belber, director Richard Linklater
(""Before Sunrise"") uses digital video technology to capture an intense
character study in real time.","When he's not spending too much time sitting on one shot -- trying to be
kind of video ""underground"", I guess -- he's pulling off annoying swish
pans between Hawke and Leonard while they argue, trying way too hard to
force some urgency.; So it's quite a disappointment to see
Linklater's direction of Tape alternate between being stale and cliché.; Through some poorly delivered dialogue -- although much of it can't be
saved from the page anyway -- we learn of Vince's problematic tendencies
and Johnny's existence as a self-proclaimed goody-two-shoes, high on
moral fiber and good intentions.; Hawke's performance reeks of exaggeration, and Leonard would appear to
be a plain-old bad actor.; Tape is based on a play by Stephen Belber, and the playwright
contributes the clunky script, full of obvious dialogue and silly
posturing."
23954.0,Atlantic City,1996.0,"It's one of the most unusual love stories you will ever see.; Sally (Susan Sarandon) is training to become a casino
dealer, and dreams of escaping her dreary routine
to live a cultured life, perhaps in Paris.; This
Canadian and French production first released abroad with the above mentioned
title would come to the U.S. in 1981 with the title 'Atlantic City' and play
across the country including a run in a Los Angeles theatre to qualify it for
Oscar consideration which it got being nominated for five Oscars: Best
Picture, Actor (Lancaster), Actress (Susan Sarandon), Director (Louis Malle)
and Original Screenplay (John Guare).; His romantic
consumation of their relationship is based purely on lust while Sarandon uses
him in a somewhat justifiable manner out of a sense of survival and need.; 'Atlantic
City' manages to convince its audience that while it stands up as a
respectable character study, it's also a story of human nature at its most
immoral and has the stamina to invoke itself as a classic motion picture
without popularity but takes its place as a buried treasure.","""Atlantic City"" is a character study that falls
short of expectations.; While the characters are
interesting, their actions are not always credible.; Why would she let him move in with her again?; In that film he played a second rate preacher whose moral
followings were called into question.; He is also
fond of telling everyone that he has just killed
two gangsters, which does not seem credible even
given his need for recognition."
24065.0,Guncrazy,1999.0,"I highly
recommend this film.; I think the film should be commended for
its achievement--it is an incredible film for a a first time director,
and an incredible non-mainstream film with a definite political view.; Who ever played the
sheriff also was great.; However, beneath the surface, this
movie has surprisingly deep currents, with characters and relationships
that are complex.; GUN CRAZY certainly isn't for everyone, but anyone
who has a taste for twisted love stories will find something here to
savor.","They serve as propaganda
pieces, but without artistic, particularly cinematic, flair.; I
can't think of very many--and FRIED GREEN TOMATOES does not count for
the purposes of this debate.; Even the
most ridiculous elements of this over-the-top scene have been left
intact in the final print of the movie.; 10)  I wish I could come up with some insightful comparison between
these two films, something along the lines of ""women's pictures"" or some
other Critspeak.; This film is not particularly concerned about getting all the
details right, either."
24066.0,"Happy, Texas",1993.0,"A good, subtle touch.; It's sweet and it's
simple and it's heartfelt and it's well worth your time.; One of the best subplots in a wonderful romp of a film concerns the
moves that Chappy puts on Harry.; The busy but always reliable Macy brings a nice touch
of pathos to his wonderful performance as Chappy, the lovelorn
sheriff.; Also
great is the date Harry has with the chief.","Not funny.; This movie is a total mess.; This bank robbery is the final
clumsy attempt to draw laughs out of its unconvincing story, but this
robbery scene was too witless to watch without cringing.; Here is a film with nothing -- nothing -- going for it; how it
became a big hit at the Sundance Film Festival is completely beyond me.; Happy, Texas is the worst kind of disappointment, a film that has no
idea what to do with its ingenious comic premise."
24070.0,Mixed Nuts,1998.0,"(For a really memorable night, see it back-to-back with
TRAPPED IN PARADISE.); There is
lots in this lightweight film that will make you laugh.; Running away with the movie in one of her funniest roles is
Madeline Kahn playing Blanche Mutchnik, who picks on everyone, the
callers and the volunteers.; As soon as your uncontrollable laughter has subsided after
reading that last sentence, you can continue reading this review.; There are other people in the show, and in fact, the movie is
filled with quirky characters.","I recommend you avoid this show
at all cost, and I give it 1/2 of a star because, although the movie
was a disaster from start to finish, at least it was more stupid than
offensive.; There's nothing even
remotely funny here.; Regardless
of how dreadfully unfunny that Martin/Ephron collaboration was (she
wrote it; he starred in it), it was only a precursor to MIXED NUTS, as
unwatchable a motion picture as you're likely to find this Christmas
season.; The director should be shot.; Even
though she has a fairly hefty part, Juliette Lewis somehow manages not
to be the most annoying person on screen."
24128.0,Stop Making Sense,1984.0,"Brilliant,
innovative, and probably one of the best rock performances I've seen in my
life.; What a refreshing way to view music.; Demme's pace, and his use of light and color (deep blues and reds),
reminded me of Stanley Kubrick, who displayed similar skills in his
masterpiece, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.; Jonathan Demme's (The
Silence of the Lambs) film has it all: great music given a backbone of
top-notch camerawork and editing.; Byrne's oddity is set in perfect contrast to solid
punk-funk-rock and roll.","If I put in a CD and listened to the music of the Talking Heads for 90
minutes, I would be bored.; If I watched a 90 minute Talking Heads music
video I would be bored.; There are barely ever any audience
reaction shots or music video intercuts: the camera focuses solely on
the band.; STOP MAKING SENSE, on the other hand, did nothing for
me.; Jonathan Demme's lighting designer has a ball
aiming his beam at one point just under Byrne's chin, giving
the effect of a schoolboy trying to scare his classmates on
Halloween Eve."
24150.0,Halloween II,2001.0,"""Halloween"" has its firm place in the horror genre, a classic shocker that
moved with the slow, creepy pace of menacing, inevitable evil.; It is the opening scenes and the closing climax that come close to Carpenter's
original, evoking a real sense of terror.; Sometimes not
knowing a murderer's motives is more frightening than knowing.; For more reviews, check out JERRY AT THE MOVIES at

rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; He is facing a
court-martial back at the institution.","Another problem is the screenplay, which gives motivation
to the snail-paced killer Michael Myers by telling us that Laurie's sibling
status is the sole reason why he came back to Haddonfield!; These are merely distractions considering we don't learn much
about said victims.; I could have lived without seeing a syringe inserted in
a woman's eyeball, or a half-naked woman scalded to death.; There are kids dressing up in Michael Myers masks, lustful doctors,
kids biting into razor-sharp apples, irate dogs, and a largely nonexistent
hospital staff caring for the weak Laurie who mostly sleeps and has nightmares.; ""Halloween II"" continues the same sense of dread and menace that the original
had, but the gore is accentuated making the goings-on less suspenseful than
they should have been."
24227.0,Excessive Force,1998.0,"James Earl Jones makes a few appearances as Jake, the owner of the
bar above which McCain lives.; Good
films of this genre are rousing.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; I hope he got paid
well.; Fortunately, Jones' reputation
is solid enough that this shouldn't blemish it.","His acting isn't any better than
Steven Seagal's and he lacks anything resembling charisma.; This one is simply dull.; It doesn't work.; This role is superfluous and obviously
included in an attempt to give EXCESSIVE FORCE credibility through the
use of a ""big name"".; Little
that I say here is likely to make any difference to anyone, but since I
sat through this ninety- minute travesty, I intend to express my
opinion."
24525.0,Hurlyburly,1999.0,"""I know I don't know what I
mean, which is better than most people,"" Eddie confesses towards the
end.; It's a riveting performance as one of
the best-written characters of the year.; This is not a great drama as much as it is a black comedy that has great
acting and intriguing dialogue.; The sound is excellent.; And yet it is such a deeper and more shocking film.","The dialogue remains horribly pretentious and artificial.; 'Hurlyburly' is like a
car wreck with no chance to breathe, an extremely high decibel level,
and a screenplay by David Rabe, based on his play, that tries too hard
to look like a well written piece of art when it is nothing more than a
two hour play on semantics with a calculating sense of the preposterous.; Rabe has crafted a script that will be irritating and stilted, just adequate,
or revelatory depending on the viewer.; It's all pretentious nonsense as these Hollywood losers snort cocaine,
drink, screw and continually blab about nothing.; But that would be doing a disservice to anyone who is thinking of seeing
this sorry excuse for a motion picture."
24584.0,Get Real,1999.0,"Get Real contains a number of quite moving moments, but
it is also a remarkably warm and very funny film.; Silverstone beautifully captures Stephen's vulnerability,
angst and confusion with a well rounded performance.; This delightful and entertaining film offers a
warm and engaging portrait of teen angst that will also appeal to more
mainstream audiences.; This film deals with these things
rather carefully but never gives up, and makes sure that the total honesty
and beauty survive to win.; But, I'm afraid the genre
has taken a step in the
wrong direction with Simon Shore's dramatic comedy ""Get Real"", the first
feature from Paramount
Classics.","Later, we witness his
stereotypical sex education class, complete with a video of copulating
porcupines and a lecture that includes horrible descriptions of sex that
would scar the minds of youths forever.; ""Get Real"" is also very, very melodramatic, so I ended up feeling almost
nothing for it's characters,
making it a dull experience.; Can you quickly name the three clichés that make up the basic
gay film?; Most of the rest of
the story is fairly predictable from this point.; One
just wished the filmmaker had not felt compelled to put such saccharin
twists on the behavior."
24623.0,Decoy,1987.0,"Cynics would say that Peter Weller and Robert Patrick seem
like an excellent choice for the roles of mercenaries
because they played killing machines in their best known
films (ROBOCOP, TERMINATOR 2).; The job is not so simple

plot is incoherent, the action scenes look terrible, so in
the end DECOY sinks bellow the standards, which are lowest,
even for B movies.; Author of this review tends
to agree with that, but their presence alone is not enough
to save DECOY from well-deserved road to ""straight-to-
video"" oblivion.; When he was
executive producer for DECOY, Canadian 1995 action thriller
directed by Victor Rambaldi, the result was something which
was only bad and hardly the stuff he is going to be
remembered for.; The only thing that is relatively
pleasing to the eye is the use of Saskatchewan locations but
the viewers might do themselves a great service if they
watch some documentary instead of this.; Reason for that is their former
employer who had obtained a revolutionary new chip."
24662.0,Cats Don't Dance,2000.0,"Jeffrey, age 8,
thought the film was ""excellent,"" and he especially liked Danny.; His
friend Amara, age 5 1/2, liked the film too but got a bit scared when
Max chased Danny.; ""If we all work together, we can make our
dreams come true,"" he tells the animals in a classic pep talk.; The House of the
Mouse has been smart enough to hitch its wagon to timeless stories,
resonant themes and memorable characters.; CATS DON'T DANCE is lightweight
stuff, a simple ""naive kid makes good"" story as much _from_ the 1940s as
_about_ the 1940s, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.","The problem is, CATS DON'T DANCE was so hectic, I actually had a hard time
telling what was going on, or even what the characters were saying half the
time.; Danny spends the rest of the movie as a virtual warrior in a sort
of Animal Liberation Front.; Cute critters and peppy
tunes, like those in Warner's CATS DON'T DANCE, aren't enough to support a
flimsy script and simplistic animation.; But as incredibly dull as the rest of the
film was, I can't really say it's a worthwhile effort.; Not only the animation
quality (which was very two-dimensional and boring), but the comedic devices
and storyline played more like a Saturday morning episode of ""Loony Toons""
than an elaborate Disney production."
24711.0,Above Suspicion,1989.0,"Protagonist of the film is Dempsey (played by Christopher
Reeve), superb police detective who is loving father and
caring husband.; He
approaches Gail and Nick and asks them to help him in his
plan to end his life by staging his suicide as apparent
murder.; However,
suspension of disbelief, necessary for viewers to enjoy this
film, is forever marred by the real-life events that put the
entire plot of the film into completely different
perspective.; Knowing that he would have to spend the rest
of his life in a wheelchair, Dempsey decides to commit
suicide and provide for his family in the process.; In 1995 Christopher Reeve, actor best known for
playing lead character in SUPERMAN films, filled headlines
after suffering terrible riding accident that left him
paraplegic.","Director Schachter is not able to make his mind
whether to make this film as straightforward thriller,
police action film or courtroom drama.; Genre confusion is
not much helped by low budget that makes this film look much
cheaper than it should be.; Motivated less by compassion and more by huge
insurance policy, adulterous couple decides to participate
only to find themselves as targets of Dempsey's diabolical
scheme.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; The script, which was written by Jerry Lazarus, Steven
Schachter and actor William H. Macy (who plays the role of
prosecutor in the film) had some potential."
24734.0,K2,1996.0,"This adds a bit to the realism.; This was very well captured.; Although K2 is second in height, K2 is considerably more technically
challenging than most Everest routes.; It makes for great
arguments at high altitude.; Time is the climber's single most important resource.","I mean slow, meticious, *dull*.; Yeah, some dumb looking soloing (contrary to
most expedition technique), numerous dramatic falls and arrests--far too
many.; The film is not among the worse films to
portray climbing: bad films (with a few decent climbing scenes) like
THE EIGER SANCTION [the ""Plan 9"" of climbing films] or FIVE DAYS ONE
SUMMER.; Far too high.; I had not planned on reviewing this film until a storm of more or
less uninformed material appeared."
24739.0,Miracle Mile,1998.0,"Ben Kingsley (one of my 
  favorite actors) is excellent as Basil, Charles Dance does a fine job as the 
  archaeologist, and Helen Mirren is very good as Basil's best friend.; MIRACLE MILE (1989) ****
  A sleeper from last year, this story mixes romance, suspense and the threat
  of nuclear war in a very different, very engrossing film.; We watch his portrayal of suppressed panic, which breaks at
different levels for different people, and wonder if we would fare any
better in a similar situation.; Beautiful
  cinematography and great performances by the leads, esp.; The film
  covers Orton's rise to success and the emotional struggles of Halliwell 
  to adjust from his early start as Orton's mentor to his later role as 
  Orton's ""personal assistant.""","""Oh s**t!; Despite 
  the good performances and an interesting setting (ritzy Rhode Island during 
  the 20's or 30's), the story on this one never really drew me in.; Warning: those who have trouble understanding
  heavy accents (particularly Cockney) may want to avoid this film.; (To tell more
  would spoil too much of the plot.); I couldn't tell either."
24746.0,Six-String Samurai,1998.0,"You can be certain; you will see loving tributes to both
Akira Kurosawa, and Kenji Misumi (Lone Wolf & Cub).; So many techniques and styles are used in filming
the fight scenes that some of the references may be lost on most film
historians.; At a time when Hollywood is aping everything
from Hong Kong filmmakers, its refreshing to find a film that tries to
create it's own style.; Falcon also delivers the cod 
rock'n'roll dialogue with a wonderfully thin-lipped mealy pout and 
proves surprisingly lithe when it comes to all the fight poses.; Each one more inventive than
the one preceding it.","McGuire is the only actor who demonstrates 
any talent potential.; The 
formless story drifts aimlessly like a tumbleweed blowing nowhere in 
particular.; And it all gets pretty silly - the scenes 
with the moronic mutants conducting a 'Mad Max' style chase at about 
five miles per hour is quite inane.; SIX-STRING SAMURAI seems to think so, 
but if we have to have another parody of a post-apocalyptic America, 
does it have to be this unwatchably bad?; Occasionally these little films live up to their hype,
but most time they do not."
24929.0,Return of the Living Dead Part II,2001.0,"The story has been scaled sown so that two teens and one
pre-teen can be the heroes.; And he did.; And NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD prospered.; And audiences looked upon RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD and many were well
pleased.; And in the fullness of time George Romero saw that there were
multitudes who were mindful of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and he made DAWN OF
THE DEAD.","And it played only at theaters with big screens and
no walls.; An occasional clever joke but in general a
     degradation of this branch of the series.; And in the land of America there had been no ZOMBIE I, so there ZOMBIE II
was called ZOMBIE.; Capsule review:  Entertaining but unimaginative
     retelling of RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD with younger
     protagonists.; And it came to pass that in the land of Pittsburgh there dwelt a
lowly maker of television commercials."
24940.0,Head Over Heels,1999.0,"A romantic comedy requires 
not only laugher, but love.; The first meeting of Monica and Jim balances the sweet charming beats

through December, shows the best of a bad lot plus the better stuff 
of potential Oscar candidates.","4 models + 1 cop = a very bad scene.; Not only is the amateurish Head Over Heels based on a lame premise,
but its co-stars are supermodels, too.; In line with the recent and unbelievably profitable string of lame teen
films like Save the Last Dance and Dude, Where's My Car?, Head Over
Heels is a train wreck of bad lines and predictable plot twists.; It's chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting
snuggly into a preposterous plot.; The story for this mess is attributed to a committee of writers - John J.
Strauss, Ed Decter, David Kidd and Ron Burch - and it shows in its
scattershot approach to the disjointed material."
25128.0,Love & Sex,1998.0,"In a role that for once neither relies on her imposing
physicality nor stunning beauty, Janssen reveals a beguiling
vulnerability and wonderful comic flair as Kate revisits her romantic and
sexual misadventures while attempting to write an article about finding
the perfect man--a subject that could not be more foreign to her.; They also enjoy sharing bedtime 
flatulence.; There is a sense of fun when
these two are together, and not the artificially sunny type of movie
happiness; just as doing a typically awkward striptease in front of a
camcorder is good for a laugh, so are more grounded moments like pointing
out each other's physical flaws; nonchalantly doing what would normally
be embarrassing in the comfort of bed; and coming up with knowingly dumb
yet intimately special terms like ""I cheese sandwich you.""; ""Scheduled spontaneity is the key to 
long-term love,"" he says.; Janssen, most widely known for the empowered female types she's
played in films such as _X-Men_ and especially _GoldenEye_, is a
revelation as Kate Wells, magazine writer and perpetual screw-up in the
ways of romance.","The cast 
almost uniformly suffers from a bad of case of low energy.; Yet, the filmmakers seem inexplicably
scared to go `all the way' and instead opt for a very unsettling lack of
nudity.; ---A copy of this review can be found at

at http://www.moviereviews.org/florida_film_festival_2000.htm --- `I know ten times more about blowjobs than I do about relationships' insists
Kate Welles (Famke Janssen) in the opening moments of `Love and Sex.'; Although the movie has some wonderfully acerbic moments and some 
insightful parts, it is basically forgettable fluff.; The article in question, originally supposed to be a
commentary on the pleasures of oral sex, turned into a how-to on performing
effective fellatio; Kate refers to it as `a blow by blow' description."
25166.0,Drowning Mona,1974.0,"Jeff immediately replies,
""Finally!""; Your Comments Appreciated!; Laid-back
police chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito) soon learns that the car had been
sabotaged and launches a murder investigation.; Danny DeVito was one of the standouts in the cast, playing an excellent
straight man in a town full of ninnies.; William Fichtner and Marcus Thomas make an effective
father-son pair, Danny DeVito nicely underplays his role and Neve
Campbell whoops it up as a hillbilly debutante.","* - One of the worst movies ever made.; But ultimately the film doesn't gather much
steam, lulls from point to point, and basically just bounces around from one
decent joke to another lame one and then back again.; * * - Pretty bad, see it only if you've got nothing better to do.; The result is a sloppy whodunit
that tries too hard to be quirky and, instead, is a pretty darn dull
knock-off of Fargo.; It is a very bad
film."
25224.0,Masterminds,1999.0,"Unlike painting and literature, the cinema both gives to life
and takes from it..."" The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; It's unlikely that adults will find much worthwhile in MASTERMINDS,
unless it's Patrick Stewart's jolly performance as the leader of the
terrorists.; Starring: Patrick Stewart, Vincent Kartheiser, Brenda Fricker.; He shows a great sense for delivering what the film's
audience demands, sneering and threatening just enough so that it's worth
a big cheer when he allows himself to be humiliated.; And it's a
fairly satisfying diversion for that audience, as well as one their
parents don't need to worry aobut.","MASTERMINDS is bad.; Unfortunately, in MASTERMINDS, the 
distinguished actor is literally the only worthwhile piece of flotsam 
bobbing around on a sea of hackneyed sewage.; Instead of this being a pulse-pounding 
rollercoaster ride of adrenaline, it's a pointless bore.; Everything 
that was special about DIE HARD has been negated here by careless 
writing, bad acting, and pedestrian direction.; (Plot-wise, such an omission wouldn't have mattered 
-- the movie is so obvious that it would have been simple to guess what 
was missing.)"
25232.0,This Is My Father,1999.0,"""This is My Father"" interweaves a comic light spirit with
melancholy and ultimate tragedy so seamlessly that we scarcely are
aware of when one genre ends and the other takes root.; This is the current reality and is
probably the basis for Paul Quinn's intriguing film, ""This is My
Father.""; The Fiona-Kieran relationship is revealed to us and to the Chicago 
Kieran in successive episodes, with the time frames alternating 
between 1939 and the present.; ""This is My Father"" carries some of the baggage usually conveyed in
stories of rural Ireland.; THIS IS MY FATHER(US/Ireland) **1/4   Written & directed by Paul 
Quinn.","The romance itself ultimately makes no sense from Fiona's
side, with nary an attempt to explain why the spunky girl would be charmed
by the socially inept Kieran.; Unfortunately, that romance is so ridiculously apocryphal that it's not
clear until the last ten minutes which of two girls is supposed to be his
own lovely lass.; For one thing, relationships can be muddled.; In fact, the entire
framing story feels like little more than a series of ridiculous
contrivances.; Caan's monotonously shellshocked performance offers little
indication as to what his problem is, how long it's been going on, or how
it's connected to his equally shellshocked sister and ill mother."
25355.0,Irma Vep,1994.0,"IRMA VEP features some 
wonderful performances (notably those of Cheung, Leaud, and Richard), 
that, in concert with its sure direction and smart script, make for a 
wholly satisfying motion picture.; Maggie is our 
often-bewildered but always good-humored guide through this strange 
land, and we become attached to her almost from the beginning.; In a picture that has a lot to say about the 
film making process and the people who engage in it, Assayas has not 
restricted his commentary to the French movie industry -- he has words 
for the American and Hong Kong brands, as well.; Distributor: Zeitgeist Films
In French and English with subtitles IRMA VEP, Olivier Assayas' incisive and entertaining 1996 feature, 
takes an offbeat look at the current state of French cinema.; There's also a more 
serious point to this aspect of the movie, as it will prod viewers into 
considering what they look for and appreciate in a film, and whether the 
true strength of the medium lies in its variety and versatility.","One character states that many French movies have become boring because 
they're intended only for the elite, and that the tendency of French 
directors to embrace such limited projects is contributing to the death 
of the movie industry.; Re-arrange the letters in the name ""Irma Vep"" and you get 
""vampire.""; Vidal, who is trying 
a comeback after his once-promising career has hit rock bottom, spends a 
great deal of time muttering unintelligibly about his artistic 
viewpoint.; The sight 
of actress Maggie Cheung (SUPERCOP) garbed in a skintight, black latex 
outfit should be enough to create lines at the box office (it won't, but 
that's beside the point).; Are French films stuffy?"
25389.0,Matinee,1998.0,"This isn't a gag film like many other comedies
but an intelligent, well-thought out, film about real people with real
problems told in an often hilarious way.; I believe that Goodman is one of the
finest comedic actors in the business today.; The film shown in this film is great.; Cathy Moriarty (KINDERGARTEN
COP, NEIGHBORS) does a great job with her role.; The cast for this film I feel does an excellent job.","It's not clear whether the movie is trying to make a
point or simply emphasizing its historical context.; Unfortunately, the script falters during a hackneyed 
'child-in-peril' climax, which is dispensed with so briefly that there's 
almost no justification for its inclusion.; The writing might have been dull, but it is unlikely
to have been so melodramatic or vaudevillian.; The distorted style of MANT!; is inconsistent with the rest of the film."
25440.0,Widows' Peak,1998.0,"A relaxing, simple, feel good movie.; While there is plenty of lovely scenery, there is also
a tremendous level of energy, a sassy edge uncommon to films in similar
settings.; This is a 
very British comedy that will cause laughter and smiles wherever it is 
shown.; A funny, charming, witty
mystery story, murder and mirth in equal measure.; Sure, the plot is
devious enough to keep you happily befuddled until the very end--which
is nice--but when you look back over the journey, it all seems pretty
incredible.","I suppose
the writer wrote how two men would handle it, and ""femalized"" the
fight, but it just doesn't work.; The dialogue is muted, the direction is
limp, and the music is way too-intrusive.; Natasha Richardson and
Joan Plowright seem fine (Natasha's accent wavers all over the place
but then I guess it's supposed to), but Mia Farrow feels wrong.; The trouble is--and it's a kind of tribute to Mia Farrow's
enduring ingenue good looks--that she doesn't look old enough or act
old enough to be this impecunious middle-aged spinster.; This is not a film predicated on some
gasp-inducing, CRYING GAME-like twist; rather, the plot twists are just
there to allow the character development, befuddling at first, to fall
into place."
25501.0,"After Dark, My Sweet",2000.0,"It's well-worth
seeing, and Patric's performance makes this a film worth buying.; AFTER DARK, MY SWEET pulls you in bit by bit, always holding back
and making you try to fit the pieces together.; But, of course, this opposition is illusory; noir   
is the Western's illegitimate child, and the two genres have fertilized   
and influenced each other in countless ways.; The acting is superb.; Most obviously, the best   
films in the two genres share the same ur-protagonist, a complex hero who   
is at once sinner and saint.","And it's hard to do a film that's mostly about absence; it tends   
to hollow out the entire project, and indeed, this film is missing any   
real energy or drive.; But the novel has a   
punchy energy that this film lacks; the novel ends up as a framework for   
Foley to do what he wants to do.; The storyline is firmly grounded in Thompson's novel; much of the   
dialogue is culled more or less word for word.; Interesting from the
very beginning, it sure as hell doesn't follow a formula.; And what he seems to want is to give us   
a noir that's really a sort of hollowed-out Western."
25624.0,Rosewood,1973.0,"Don Cheadle rocks, as usual, Esther Rolle is a great all-loving maternal
force in the film, and Bruce McGill is awesome as the most hateful
bigot.; Many
of the individual images in ROSEWOOD are riveting, portraying
unromanticized violence and pastoral beauty with equal effectiveness
thanks to the impressive cinematography of Johnny E. Jensen.; There's a kernel of truth that both films have in 
common -- the theme of the duality of human nature:  the capacity for 
great good and great evil, boundless love and infinite hatred.; Singleton is careful to present a balanced and believable picture of the 
participants on both sides.; It is an important film that should not be missed.","The only actor who does
resort to broad histrionics is Kellner; while the woman who causes all the
madness should be shrill, she's shrill to the point of inducing a headache.; But it doesn't work out.; An easy mistake to make would have been for Singleton to craft an
ultra-violent diatribe against racism, thus making a statement and
little more.; It
damages the credibility of a film when a screenwriter seemingly could
not be bothered to pick up a World Almanac to check a day of the week.; Here's barely intelligible as the local law.)"
25697.0,Getting Away with Murder,1999.0,"Cast: Dan Aykroyd, Lily Tomlin, Jack Lemmon, Bonnie Hunt, Brian Kerwin

Producers: Penny Marshall and Frank Price
Screenplay: Harvey Miller
Cinematography: Frank Tidy
Music: John Debney
U.S.; BILKO, EXIT TO EDEN) and supporting parts in light dramas (MY 
GIRL).; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER is 
too fatuous and superficial to have any dramatic impact, and all of its 
supposed ""twists"" are hackneyed and predictable.; As I was watching this movie, 
I wondered how anyone could make such a lame picture about this serious 
subject and get away with it, or why a producer would expect more from 
this limp screenplay than a complete failure -- which is precisely what 
resulted.; This time around, he appears to be going through the motions 
with even less gusto than usual.; Distributor: Savoy Pictures Some movies are ruined in post-production.; The script, which is 
credited to director Harvey Miller (who wrote PRIVATE BENJAMIN), is 
peppered with attempts at levity, but few of these jokes have any zing."
25884.0,Feds,2001.0,"The training course is presented seriously and realistically
with future Senator Fred Dalton Thompson playing quite
believable chief instructor and giving lessons usually not
applied by most of the on-screen lawmen.; Those who have read some of my previous reviews know that I
have some problems accepting words like ""comedy"" and ""Ivan
Reitman"" in the same sentence.; Unlike Mary Gross, who has the same facial
expression for the most of the film, she gives some realism
and humanity for her character.; FBI, just as any
other police organisation in the world, relies on its brains
more than its guns, and this film reflects that - good
psychological skills, intelligence and mastery of
complicated legal procedures are actually more valuable than
simple gunplay.; This message of FEDS is more important than
cliched and unsuccessful attempts to preach feminism.","Luckily, charm and tragically underused comedic
talent of Rebecca de Mornay save this film from turning into
total disaster.; Probably some time during production Goldberg and his
screenplay co- writer Len Bloom realised that their gags
simply aren't funny and that this rather weak copy of POLICE
ACADEMY couldn't work.; Even with that, this film remain unattractive and
its short length shows the lack of creative juices among its
makers.; Janis
Zuckerman (played by Mary Gross), her nerdish roommate, has
quite another problem - she could eat toughest academic
courses for breakfast, but her physical skills and fitness
seem way bellow high FBI standards.; Reitman record as producer was equally
unimpressive, and FEDS, 1988 comedy directed by Dan Goldberg
is just another example."
25985.0,Jump Tomorrow,1995.0,"Granted, there's a lot more going on in Tomorrow than in Paradise,
but the similarities are still there.; Jump Tomorrow is cute with a capital C.  Everything about it is cute, from
the story, to the direction, to the sets, to the songs.; Tomorrow is a lot like Jim Jarmusch's Stranger Than Paradise in more ways
than just having three main characters and being predominantly set on Lake
Erie.; As chance would have it, Alicia and her smarmy Brit boyfriend Nathan (James
Wilby) are hitching a ride to Canada, and most of Tomorrow shows Gerard
trying to coerce George into following Alicia and winning her affections.; When a love-obsessed
Frenchman, Gerard (Hippolyte Girardot), runs into him at the
airport where George had gone to meet his intended but is one
day late, the two strike up a conversation about the nature of love
and find themselves promptly together in a rental car where
Gerard agrees to give George a lift to Niagara Falls, the site of
his forthcoming marriage.","How George and Alicia ever got cozy with each other is
anybody's guess, but director Joel Hopkins seems to be clueless
on this matter, especially since--as we later learn--George's
fiance is a strikingly attractive Nigerian immigrant, Sophie (Abiola
Wendy Abrams) while Alicia is a plain-featured, motormouthed
bore.; Nonetheless the performers try their best with a lame script,
with Tunde Adebimpe successfully maintaining his deadpan
features (not too difficult considering the lack of laughs in the
script), Hippolyte Girardot doing OK as a second-rate Daniel
Auteuil, and James Wilby projecting embarrassment at not being
in his usual Merchant-Ivory venue.; George, who looks like he came out of his mom wearing a suit, could be a
grown-up Urkel on quaaludes.; The film is unlike recent British drug-and-crime
imports like ""Trainspotting,"" ""Sexy Beast,"" ""Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels"" but considering its indie classification it is
virtually bereft of style or signature--more like a romantic sitcom
you're likely to see on TV any weeknight at about 7.; ""Jump Tomorrow"" is a curiously unfunny romantic comedy,
with sparks generated only by the relationship between two
heterosexual men who team up on a buddy trip that takes them
on the road to Niagara Falls and vicinity."
26141.0,Fatal Instinct,1998.0,"There's another woman in Ned's life, as well - his shy, innocent 
secretary Laura (Sherilyn Fenn), whose past is about to catch up to her 
in the form of an abusive husband that she ran away from.; Most of the 
funniest moments in FATAL INSTINCT are shown in the theatrical and 
television trailers, and I didn't laugh a whole lot when I saw them then.; He seems to have a great deal of fun
mocking the image of the sullen detective, and pulls off some
surprisingly deft physical comedy.; Never underestimate the power of expectations.; It's also a hoot watching Sean
Young play to her reputation as a jealous psycho.","Jokes are mostly lame
and not particularly funny, additionally limited with the
filmmaker's need to tame the humour to PG-13 levels.; This movie is about as stale 
and unfunny as they come.; Bad assumption.; Frankly, Sherilyn Fenn is too good to have 
been wasted in this movie.; Belaboring that issue is like watching this movie or 
continuing this review:  pointless."
26149.0,Music of the Heart,1999.0,"We
re all aware of the multiple problems facing today's youth.; It is a
movie you will stand up and cheer, a film that offers a positive message
that may also inspire as well as entertain.; It is a
movie you will stand up and cheer, a film that offers a positive message
that may also inspire as well as entertain.; In addition, it's also a terrific family film.; Give yourself a treat and see it.","Such a waste of talent.; Even so, the fact that there are only 89 of them doesn't make
any of those minutes any less tedious, and 89 minutes of Shue's strained
Acting display is 89 more than anyone should ever have to endure.; The next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre.; Roberta's 
character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat.; Meryl Streep does her best with it, but fails to lift it above
mediocrity; the general storyline is too tired and too overdone to work
with any actor or actress."
26177.0,Annie,1999.0,"Happily, the buoyant, endearing ""Annie"" about to debut on ""The
Wonderful World of Disney"" (premiering Sunday, Nov. 7 at 7 p.m. on ABC)
is a remake that easily outshines the first try.; Victor Garber's smooth tenor
makes him a solid choice for Warbucks and Audra McDonald is a walking
dream as Grace, Warbucks' devoted secretary.; Another delightful surprise is Kathy Bates, a blowsy treat as
scheming orphanage matron Miss Hannigan.; Her voice is pure and sturdy, but she
doesn't sound like an apprentice diva; when she delivers the deathless
""Tomorrow,"" she concentrates on the optimistic innocence of the lyric
rather than musical bombast.; Although Marshall probably had to scale back his choreography
to fit the TV frame, it still has plenty of zip, an achievement that's
particularly admirable considering, in the case of Bates, Cumming and
some of the other stars, he wasn't working with trained dancers.","Anyone remember what a mess director Richard Attenborough made of that
one?; Now that Marshall and company have largely erased the memory of that
earlier fiasco, perhaps as an encore they can tackle ""A Chorus Line.""; Most of us have been subjected over the years to a host of Annies
who came off as mini-Ethel Mermans, less concerned with creating a
credible character than they were with blowing their adult co-stars off
the stage.; All sorts of bad ideas -- including casting non-singer Albert
Finney as Daddy Warbucks and throwing out much of the show's score and
substituting mundane new numbers -- came together to ruin what should
have been great fun, and matters were not helped by Huston's leaden
direction and claustrophobic staging.; But even geniuses slip up once in a while, and one of Huston's
biggest mishaps was filming ""Annie,"" a mostly charmless extravaganza
adapted from the outrageously successful Broadway musical (which was in
turn, of course, taken from Harold Gray's comic strip ""Little Orphan
Annie"")."
26219.0,Sticky Fingers,1988.0,"The funniest one in the film, was Lolly's somewhat-boyfriend Sam
(Guest).; Her romantic dalliance with the parking lot attendant next
door is really good.; Danitra Vance, one of the best Ebersol-produced SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE performers of the early 80s, does a nice job as the girls' rational
musician friend.; And Mayron, who is a favorite of mine on the TV program
THIRTY-SOMETHING, is appealing in her quiet moments; it's a pity she didn't
bring the writers from the show onto this project.; STICKY FINGERS (United States, 1988)
Director: Catlin Adams
Screenwriters: Catlin Adams, Melanie Mayron
Cast: Helen Slater, Melanie Mayron, Danitra Vance, Eilleen Brennan,
      Carol Kane, Christopher Guest, Stephen McHattie Well, what can I say?","The girls try so hard to be funny
by making faces and doing slapstick, that it is a shame that the
storytelling ability of the director is so poor, that it undermines the
comedy.; Observations so far: seen quite a few films, though I
avoided IT'S ALIVE III on the basis of the lateness of the hour, IGUANA because
the showing at the Secret Festival (which I can't tell you about, sorry) was so
disturbing that I went home and read for the rest of the day, and A KILLING
AFFAIR on the recommendation of Peter Reiher.; Inside the bag is $900,000 smackers, which
throws the girls into a frenzy of feeble comic antics, unworthy of
Laurel and Hardy on a bad hair day.; To provide some NYC character atmosphere, we have the girls' landlord
(Brennan) demanding rent from the girls in a strident NYC accent.; Christopher Guest, one of
the best comic performers of the last decade, isn't given anything to be use,
and ends up being rather dull."
26247.0,Bombay,1997.0,"And, 
while the music isn't exactly of the toe-tapping variety, it's stronger 
and more memorable than most songs in American movies over the past year 
or two.; It 
also reminds us of the maxim that those who don't learn from history are 
doomed to repeat it.; Cinematographer Rajiv Menon captures the chaos of the riots.; In many ways, BOMBAY is deceptive, but the manner in which it 
deceives the audience adds to its eventual impact.; Just when you're starting to feel comfortable with BOMBAY, 
everything changes -- and the unexpected shift in tone hits like a punch 
to the gut.","Also, the film might have been a bit better with a screen or two
at the beginning explaining the basis of the conflict and the name ofa
political group referenced in the film.; There are nightmarish depictions of the riots
that presumably will bother the entertainment-oriented audience.; Trying to do both, it is not altogether
successful at either.; Largely because of their limited North 
American appeal and dubious quality, Indian movies are routinely ignored 
by distributors.; There are some light musical
interludes in what is being shown but not the popular songs that were
probably in the original."

would do themselves a favour if they skip this one and rent
FIRE OVER AMAZON instead.; Dale Launer's humour is
not very effective, even bellow the standards of 1980s teen
comedies, and the actors don't seem to put much effort in
their work.; There is perhaps one good scene in the entire
film, but the most interesting thing about it is seeing what
popular actresses like Sandra Bullock had to do before
reaching Hollywood Olympus.; Ancient pop songs seem like a rather strange inspiration for
the films, and it isn't hard to imagine such films being
equally unimpressive as those inspired by video games.; Madame Ruth is ready to improve young scientist's
by offering him ""Love Potion No."
26269.0,Twilight,1997.0,"Sarandon is a 
wonderfully mature-yet-sultry femme fatale, Garner is enjoyable as one 
of Harry's old friends, and Witherspoon is fresh and sexy.; It's in keeping with the characters of Harry
and his contemporaries Jack and the ironic Raymond (Garner), a former cop,
later a film-studio's security chief, now retired and living in a dream
house.. At the same time, while the typical classic film noir, although not
humorless, takes itself with seriousness, has passion and, inevitably, a
""femme fatale,"" ""Twilight"" departs from this norm.; My favorite character actor, M.  Emmet Walsh, has a wonderfully
satiric 45 second part as terminally wounded private eye.; The simplest way
to describe it is reassurance, a confidence that the movie will not
disappoint you.; Email him at
redman@bvoice.com with your witty comments.)","However, the script is tired and
predictable.; The lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full
effort, even when burdened with a bad script.; Unfortunately
the principal characters are poorly developed and unbelievable.; The only reason for watching is the actors.; The editing lacks a philosophical
consistency."
26337.0,China Moon,1995.0,"An excellent actress I hope to see in many more roles.; My view is 
that this is a MUST SEE for devotees of film noir.; The romance is better than the last show (BLINK) that
Stowe was in although I must admit BLINK was better overall because its
mystery worked.; If you
have a romantic or a poetic side, I especially recommend it to you.; What do people think the popularity of film
noir says about the way late Twentieth Century people see themselves
and their destiny?","The first forty minutes are not only dull, but dull in a manner that
calls attention to the bad dialogue and obvious plot points.; Basically, for anyone who just wants to see a truly convoluted
thriller without considering the logic or intelligence of the
serpentine track of the story, CHINA MOON isn't a terrible choice.; The real reason to see CHINA MOON, however, has nothing to do with
this ""mood thing"".; It is easy to listen to the dialog and think this is pretentious and
kind of ridiculous.; As far as thrillers go, this one starts off dead in the water."
26338.0,Romance,1997.0,"Breillat's opening
scene of Marie (Caroline Ducey) in the virginal-white bedroom
of her lover Paul (Sagamore Stevenin), vividly conveys to us
the extent of her frustration.; My thoughts are
that the film's presentation didn't particularly excite me, but
afterwards it left me thinking about what it had to say about
relationships, which are still just as great a mystery as God is, and I
began to warm to the film more than while I was watching it.; Only
when a woman frees herself from dependence on timid,
restrained, traditional--in a word uncaring--men to satisfy
them can she find her sexual identity and become
transfigured.; With the startling, innovative movie ""Romance,"" professed
feminist Catharine Breillat has given us a film quite a bit more
mature and developed than her innocuous ""36 Fillette"" eleven
years ago (about a 14-year-old who may or not give up her
virginity while on vacation with her parents).; She loves him very much and early on in their
relationship there was much passion, but there is one major problem for
Marie now: Paul hasn't made love to her for months.","While its theme of one woman's struggle to overcome
sexual oppression is innovative, it lacks tact and fails miserably due
to the crudity of its approach.; I'd like a dollar for every time I've heard a woman
defensively say, ""I'm not a feminist, but..."" or a couple of
bucks for every man who intones, ""I'm all for equal pay for
equal work, but...""  Look around.; I saw the movie with two French grad
students who both walked out of the film disappointed and visibly
queasy.; The biggest problem with the film is not only its graphic (just about
dragged-out with nothing substantial occurring.; Even Rocco's biggest fans will be disappointed, because the blue movie
titan fails to satisfy."
26371.0,Maurice,1995.0,"That great
achievement, coupled with its cinematic excellence, makes it a very significant
film and one well worth seeing.; MAURICE is not a great film, but it is a good one.; Rather, it is an affirmation, a celebration, an intelligent presentation of the
strengths, hopes, fears, desires, and problems of homosexuals in Edwardian
society and (by extension) our own society of today.; James Wilby turns in a convincing performance as the torn Maurice.; There is enough quality present to make the film worth
     seeing, but not as much as you'd think.","Capsule review:  Disappointing E. M. Forster entry by
     much of the same team that made A ROOM WITH A VIEW.; Julian Sands would have been too
""pretty.""; I think Ivory wanted to
repeat that film's success, so he put in many of the same faces, forced Ben
Kingsley into the wrong role, chose a not-very-good novel, and then gave it
a long and florid treatment.; I don't know if that man was gay or not as I consider it rude and
completely inappropriate to ask a total stranger about his sexual orientation.; I do not have
any compulsive need to have charming and intelligent women on the screen in
order to make the film's depiction of male homosexuality palatable and
acceptable."
26477.0,Back to the Beach,1992.0,"Today, Annette is a perky peanut-butter pusher and Frankie owns a Ford
dealership in Ohio.; Stealing the opening scenes of the film is Demian Slade, who is hilarious 
as their punk son.; Funicello, especially, is 
so purely good and sweet that she is absolutely entertaining to watch.; And 
when you're dealing with Frankie and Annette, what more could you ask 
for?; One of the biggest surprises of the film is that the movie is a little 
bit more edgy than expected.","Then the
premise starts wearing thin and the comedy gets very uneven.; But, just like the old films, every- thing is
just hunky-dory by the end of the film (""even, with no winners and no losers,""
to borrow a line from the film).; ), and some string, and he'd have a nuclear reactor, but could he fix a
two-foot hole in the boat??""; Annette and Frankie are the only original cast members from the originals,
although the movie would have us believe there are more.; There's the obligatory big
bonfire/party, a pajama party, good-people/bad-people on the beach (updated
for the '80s audience), bikini shots galore along with the muscle-types one
always sees at the beach (at least in California!!!"
26538.0,Jack Frost,1996.0,"Beneath the many mistakes in 
""Jack Frost"" lies a sweet story with a kind spirit and a nice message.; ""No, I da snowman,"" replies Jack.; I enjoyed the 
heartfelt father and son bonding, and thought the gentle lessons on 
dealing with the death of a loved one were poignant.; Every character is essentially a decent human being, a nice 
change from the parade of creeps who populate so many movies.; As a sort of litmus test to see whether or not ""Jack Frost"" is the movie
for you, consider your response to this bit of information: It includes
Hanson performing covers of the Spencer Davis Group's ""Gimme Some Lovin'""
and the Rascals' ""Good Lovin',"" as well as a Spice Girls' rendition of
""Sleigh Ride.""","A bad joke?; Filled with
long chase scenes on snowboards and sleds, the movie tries hard to gain
some momentum but fails.; Is it some sort of karmic punishment for
being a poor father?; The script is as bad as the special effects.; It was
probably just a lazy screenwriter."
26561.0,Enchanted April,1999.0,"And this is a film that turned out to be well worth
seeing.; The film will be getting a theatrical release in the UK later this
year and I thoroughly recommend it as an enjoyable evening's
entertainment.; ENCHANTED APRIL, despite it thinness, its incredibility, is both
magical and very funny.; The actresses are letter-perfect, the husbands a tad grotesque, the deja vu
magic convincing.; This is one of the
year's best films.","It uses ellipses with
tact and no arty editing, avoids the obvious.; I
admit it was a silly reason to pay $7 to see a film but nothing else in the
film appealed to me.; The tempo is slow, not recommended to fanatics of action movies, car
crashes or gun play, but slow like a musical movement marked ""lento.""; Why, after all, would 1920's women travel alone?; Joan Plowright, the
vinegary old survivor of the Victorian literary set, who want to sit in
the shade and remember better times, takes over any scene she's in,
which is as it should be."
26665.0,Aberdeen,1998.0,"It's a film that avoids cliches for its answers, has plenty of energy,
and an intelligent script to go along with the brilliant performances by
both Lena Headey and Stellan Skarsgard.; Skarsgård and
Spring Forward's Ian Hart (he plays a trucker who gets involved in Kaisa
and Tomas' journey) turn in typically strong performances, but Headey
steals the show as the long-legged vixen with more character flaws than
a politician on the take (think of a taller, thinner Heather Langenkamp
with a Scottish accent).; When we see a flashback of Kaisa's relationship with her
dad when she was about ten years old, jumping into his arms
as he arrives home from work in their rural Scottish town, we
can understand how she had the motivation to become a
lawyer.; What she has
learned best from him, is that you can't trust men.; ""Aberdeen"" is thematically similar to Mike Figgis's ""Leaving Las Vegas,""
except there the end of the journey was most important, here it is the
journey itself that counts the most.","Weak, unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of Kaisa.; Headey's too busy acting,
using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of
insouciance.; Unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note
and repetitively bitchy dialogue, screenwriters Kristin Amundsen and
Hans Petter Moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events
forward -- lost money, roving street hooligans looking for drunks to
kick around, nosy cops, and flat tires all figure into the schematic and
convenient narrative.; ABERDEEN (director/writer: Hans Petter Moland; screenwriter: Kristin
 Amundsen; cinematographer: Philip Øgaard; editor: Sofie Hesselberg;
 cast: Lena Headey (Kaisa), Stellan Skarsgard (Tomas), Charlotte
 Rampling (Helen), Ian Hart (Clive); Runtime: 106; Norsk/Freeway;
 2000-Norway/UK) A road film about trying to reach somewhere.; Stellan Skarsgård plays
such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it's difficult to spend
nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly, boozed-out presence."
26670.0,Noises Off...,1999.0,"It's a confection, but a very entertaining one.; But it's a faithful preservation of a riotously funny
play, and I encourage anyone who liked it to go see the movie.; But it allows me to enjoy again what I enjoyed
onstage, so I have to say I liked it a lot; so did the (mostly young)
audience I saw it with, and I intend to go again.; Julie Hagerty and
Mark Linn-Baker make the most of the harried stage managers, Sheridan
embodies Vicki as well as one could ask, and Christopher Reeve, if not a
natural for the dimbulb Freddy, makes the character work anyway.; ""Noises Off"" was one of the funniest plays in a long time; and the
good news is that the movie has retained all the laughs.","Too bad, but
remember that all this takes up less than five minutes, total, of the
movie.; ); she exudes sex-bomb
instead.; Dash something off in five minutes, and you'll
probably do about as well as the screenwriter did.; This seems to be a *very* low-rent pre-Broadway bus-and-truck tour.; There is some evidence of making a few things more obvious for a mass
movie audience, like Lloyd being off directing ""Hamlet"" (presumably
better known to moviegoers than ""Richard III"")."
26834.0,Soft Deceit,1996.0,"Review written on September 20th 2001 Dragan Antulov a.k.a.; However, these days spiritual values aren't so strong, and
that includes protagonist of SOFT DECEIT, 1994 thriller
directed by Jorge Montesi.; Script by Jorge Montesi and Roy Sallows had many interesting
possibilities, especially those arising from the constant
mind games and sexual tensions between two major
protagonists.; However, the things
don't go as planned - Trent seems to always be one step
ahead of its pursuers, and Fowler realises that she started
to fall in love with attractive criminal.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Unfortunately, most of that potential got
drowned beneath the sea of cliches and terribly uninspired
performance by Kate Vernon, actress whose good looks didn't
match her acting abilities, at least in this film.; As a
result, SOFT DECEIT, despite few bright moments, is not the
film that should be viewed as anything more than forgettable
cinema product.; Adam Trent (played by Patrick
Bergin) is a professional criminal who managed to steal
millions of dollars from the Church funds.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; On the other
hand, influential Church officials want the money back and
the police, under political pressure, sets up a sting
operation for that very purpose."
26890.0,I Shot Andy Warhol,1942.0,"It's also 
engaging and entertaining and does an incredible amount of justice 
to the sense of surreality that the late 60's had.; The film is well researched and, in many ways fascinating.; THE 
SCUM MANIFESTO represents Valerie's legacy (it's still in print today).; This is a film of powerful ideas, 
impressive set design, and compelling performances.; Since the film is 
essentially a character study of Valerie, it gives an uncompromising 
presentation of her views and experiences.","Flaws are abound however, most of the film is boring and needs something
interesting to be put on the screen and the story was told harsher than it
needs to be.; I can not even repeat its name in
this G rated review of an R rated film.; What was the director trying to accomplish?; The only scene from this play we hear 
rehearsed involves a woman looking for a ""yellow turd"" for dinner.; Andy comes off as having no visible talent, and his brain seems to
be on another planet."
26937.0,F.T.W.,1989.0,"Rourke and Singer play their
characters very well, though, and it is quite a surprise to
see late Brion James in the role of sympathetic lawman.; from the title stands for ""F**k the World"", Rourke's
answer to all those who took great pleasure in describing
him as Has Been.; After the
release Wells is determined to turn another page in his life
and return to his old career.; Every movie star must think about the time when his or her
career may take a downturn and consequent dip into
straight-to-video territory or character roles.; Wells is attracted to her because she has his
initials F.T.W.","However, director Karbelnikoff didn't notice plenty of
cliches in Eddie Cook's and Mari Kornhauser's script, His
directing style, heavily influenced by MTV (visible in his
previous effort, MOBSTERS), seems inappropriate for what was
supposed to be grim, realistic story, and the ending seems
even more predictable and pathetic.; Unfortunately, this uncompromisingly
individualistic message was not worthy of the low-budget
exploitation film masquerading as ""socially conscious"" story
about losers in rural America.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; In this film Rourke plays Frank T. Wells, rodeo rider who
served prison sentence for the manslaughter.; is for some
unexplained reason (probably something to do with
controversial title) absents from many video guides, but
those who don't watch this film because of it won't miss
much."
26949.0,In Love and War,1994.0,"The music by four-time Academy Award nominee George Fenton (THE
FISHER KING, DANGEROUS LIAISONS, CRY FREEDOM, and GANDHI) is on a grand
scale.; Directed by the great Richard Attenborough (GANDHI, CRY
FREEDOM and SHADOWLANDS), the film is called IN LOVE AND WAR and stars
heartthrobs Sandra Bullock as nurse Agnes von Kurowsky and Chris
O'Donnell as Ernest Hemingway, who was one of her wartime lovers.; I like love affairs that are
believable and not ethereal.; Although the trailer looks to be similar to the disastrous ""love-story""
The English Patient, In Love and War shines way above it, in more ways
than one.; Since it was recently released on video, I decided to check
it out and see what I missed.","The final act, a 
thirty-minute denouement, is poorly-paced and tedious.; Whatever the case, the film ended up relatively
pedestrian, with a disappointing ending.; Supposedly, Hemingway's experiences with Agnes in Italy formed the 
basis for A FAREWELL TO ARMS, but it would be difficult to make that 
connection from this film, an uninspired motion picture populated by 
one- and two-dimensional characters.; Instead, he seemed more like a male Doughnut Dolly
whose job it was to hand out candy bars and cigarettes.; Her character
could be summed up by the word ""bland""."
27224.0,Lost in Yonkers,1999.0,"This is the story of the boys and that summer, but even more,
this is the story of the boy's Aunt Bella, who lives with her mother.; As is often true of stories penned by play-and-screenwriter Neil
Simon, this is a simple tale about simple people.; This is the story of
how the boys come to love their aunt and understand their grandmother, but
the telling is not pat.; Receiving top billing is Richard Dreyfus as the boys' uncle who is
fooling around on the shady side of the law.; I may be one of the few people in the world who was
not bowled over by Mercedes Ruehl in THE FISHER KING, but LOST IN YONKERS is
a good film and it is mostly due to her.","Near the
beginning of LOST IN YONKERS, Bella is completely unconvincing,
presenting a wide-eyed facade of sheer idiocy that few viewers are
likely to accept.; Except for a few humorous vignettes, this part
of LOST IN YONKERS is dull and unspectacular.; It doesn't help that Ms. Ruehl goes over-the-top
during these scenes.; In fact, for about the
first third of the film, it looks like the decision to finance this
project was a mistake.; Something has definitely been lost in the
translation, and as hard as the movie works to keep its audience's
attention, it's only partially successful."
27281.0,Operation Dumbo Drop,2000.0,"I award it a single star for a great visual
when the elephant makes his drop from the sky.; It is a doubly strange movie ""inspired by a true story.""; My son Jeffrey (age 6) gave the movie a thumbs
up and a thumbs down he said with the thumbs down being for all of the
frightening bombing.; Green Beret officer Jim Morris (Ray Liotta) and an Army Captain
played by Danny Glover manage to get the only elephant in a Vietnamese
village shot by the VC in retaliation for the village having helped the
Americans.; Be careful if your child is
sensitive to violence.","I do not recommend this show to you mainly
because it is so boring.; All of this made for a slow, tedious, and
almost serious, movie that was a putative comedy.; OPERATION DUMBO DROP runs 1:48 which is too long and too slow.; The script by Gene Quintano (of
POLICE ACADEMY 3 and 4 fame), was boring.; All of the actors
seemed to be on autopilot and were there only to collect their fees."
27295.0,Mom and Dad Save the World,1998.0,"He does a great job.; The various creatures in this film are also great, especially
the ones that live in the sewers.; Eric Idle
(NATIONAL LAMPOON'S EUROPEAN VACATION, MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF
LIFE) is the best actor in this film.; But still she's
energetic and gives it her all.; The set and costumes
are heavily retro, equally influenced by BRAZIL and ROAD WARRIOR and THE
WIZARD OF OZ, by Las Vegas and Bugsy Siegal, by Antonio Gaudi and
Dr. Seuss and Liberace.","Wallace Shawn (THE PRINCESS BRIDE, SHADOWS AND
FOG) is disappointing.; Kazui (TOKYO POP) has given us a
occult black comedy on a shoestring budget -- only one of the points of
contrast with DEATH BECOMES HER, which opened the same weekend.; However, that doesn't mean that
this film is a waste of time because it is far from that.; This film
will only be liked by those who enjoy ""stupid"" comedies.; Rutger Hauer did not strike me as a very sinister head
vampire."
27322.0,Love Jones,1998.0,"""Love,
passion -- it is what it is.""; While the romantic 
dynamic between these two is familiar, the performances add a refreshing 
dimension to the often-stale choreography of motion picture love 
affairs.; Ernest Holzmann's warm cinematography evokes an immediate intimacy
that promises more that the show ever delivers.; Larenz Tate (DEAD PRESIDENTS) and Nia Long (BOYZ 'N THE HOOD) 
invest their portrayals with a great deal of energy.; There are several reasons why this film works better than the 
common, garden-variety love story.","I suppose that if this lame excuse for a film has a point, it is
that blacks can make formulaic romantic comedies too.; When the characters open their 
mouths, it usually because they have something intelligent to say, not 
because they're trying to fill up dead air with meaningless words.; It's just not
particularly enjoyable.; As bad as FOOLS RUSH IN is, at
least it had enough energy to keep your interest.; Both Long and Tate
are good looking actors, but they are unable to make any talent they
have shine through this material."
27381.0,Innocent Blood,1998.0,"Parillaud is quite wonderful as Marie, very
sexy, very tough, at times voluptuous, at times boyish, alternately the
innocent and the enthusiastic pleasure-seeker.; It is well worth even a
full-price ticket.; The supporting cast is a lot of fun.; Especially enjoyable is Don
Rickles, who plays Sal's mouthpiece, and has a unforgettable final
scene.; I recommend INNOCENT BLOOD highly.","There are some inconsistencies in it,
which really annoy me (a couple of them could have been fixed by simply
removing a couple of scenes that didn't add much to the movie at all),
but there were not enough to make me decide I didn't like the film.; The
other really cheesey thing about it was the glowing eyes; the
commercials which had those made me think it was going to be a *really*
stupid movie.; INNOCENT BLOOD started out poorly, in my opinion, with the leading
lady parading around her apartment in the nude (usually an inauspicious
beginning for a movie.); Even security guards are watching commercial TV, not
their surveillance monitors.; (My copy of VIDEO HOUND'S GOLDEN
MOVIE RETRIEVER 1991 lists almost 120 video titles under the rubric
""Vampires"" as well as 18 under ""Vampire Spoof."")"
27442.0,Senseless,1999.0,"The answer is simple: we are taken in
by the unmixed love that our dogs feel for us (assuming we
treat them half-decently) and we probably envy the many
ways they are superior to us homo sapiens.; His primary competitor for the job is
the evil Scott Butler (David Spade, who is totally hilarious here), a
Rich Boy who gets everything handed to him by his rich father.; Surprisingly, 
Wayans is perhaps most effective when working through the romantic 
subplot.; His
""intervention"" scenes with Darryl, however, do provide a rare, and
welcome, laugh.; But
there are also very good scenes.","The screenplay does nothing with a potentially-interesting premise.; Unfortunately, Wayans can't significantly overcome this dopey
script.; He tries giving blood four times a day,
but this proves tiresome.; As a story, however, Senseless is particularly bad.; The entire job
selection process is completely ridiculous."
27455.0,Foolish,1992.0,"He spouts
profanity with impressive dexterity (to the extent which that can be done),
and while I hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes
in this movie.; He has much in common with Chris Tucker (Rush Hour, Money Talks)
in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips.; Co-star Eddie Griffin (really the star of the show) is quite a different
story.; Master P stars as Fifty Dollah' (beat that!); And indeed, I laughed at a few stand-up scenes here, but from a
feature-length movie I expect more.","Foolish, the new movie written by and
starring Master P is a jaw-droppingly horrible film, one with no redeeming
value socially, cinematically or otherwise.; Every scene which has any potential for dramatic
impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke (in a scene where
tension escalates between the two brothers, Foolish blurts out towards his
jewelry-sporting sibling ""You lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going
to be a gold rush"") or something even more idiotic such as Foolish smashing
his own car (to which I said, a bit too loudly for the occasion ""Huh?""); A better question, what would inspire a studio to produce said movie?; Starring Eddie Griffin, Master P. Rated R. What would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a
movie?; Foolish provided me with no reason to
care for these characters."
27649.0,Robot Ninja,1999.0,"The credits have a
bit of humor thrown into them, especially the part where it says no
copying the film and that the film is in no way connected to anyone
living or dead.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","The
acting in the film is horrible.; I don't recommend watching this
film even for free.; The actors don't even look like they
care about how well the film comes out.; The music is sad,
it doesn't even sound good (most of it was done by Mr.  Bookwalter on an
Amega).; The other eleven minutes are the end
credits, which are the only good part of the film."
27726.0,Q,1997.0,"This is real funny stuff.; I loved the explanation given for what God is: an invisible force we
fear, and in our vanity, we try to make it human.; What is amazing, is how well the story and the routine investigation of
the cops into this bizarre newspaper headline story go together, as
Carradine takes it all in as just another day at the office, while Quinn
couldn't be more goofier and likable, smiling like he won the lottery
when he blackmails the city into giving him a million bucks for his
info, stating that he also wants a Nixon-like pardon.; Dennis Schwartz: ""Ozus' World Movie Reviews"" © ALL RIGHTS RESERVED   DENNIS SCHWARTZ The review above was posted to the

right into the claws of the nesting bird, giggling at their misfortune
of being eating to death, and realizing he has his meal ticket, if he
plays his cards right, as the police question him about the jewelry
heist, but are really concerned about all those mysterious killings.","A tenured college professor is found flayed
in his hotel room, while on a visit to NYC, as the cops rule out suicide
since there is no reason for a tenured teacher to kill himself.; Powell, as the straight gung -ho cop, has the honor of teaming up with
an undercover cop, disguised as a mime, as they chase the lunatic priest
over NYC rooftops, after the priest fails to get the not-too-swift Quinn
to pray with him, so he can voluntarily give his blood to God.; So he sees the Museum of
Natural History's curator and hears his explanations on myths of
sacrifice, and it now comes obvious, even to a skeptic like him, that
this must be the Q in the title of the film, Quetzecoatl, the flying
Aztec god, that the curator is talking about, who can be prayed back
into existence and kept alive with the blood that must be given
willingly by the victim, or else, the ritual performed by the priest
(the flayer) is meaningless, and the bird or God, can't gain strength
from the blood.; Is there a connection
between the flayer and the birds?; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

27845.0,Trees Lounge,1957.0,"I think his brother, Michael, did an
excellent job for his debut performence.; Not
autobiographical exactly, but realistic.; Buscemi has a unique style as
evidenced in ESCAPE FROM L. A. and FARGO.; Music:  Rachel Portman.; Buscemi has
apparently lived through a good deal of what he puts on the screen, and so
keeps everything on a firmly realistic level.","It's
a pointless, lackluster, unpleasant character study of a bunch of
pointless, lackluster, unpleasant people who sit around a bar all day.; I can't argue with that, but I'm
not sure what the point is of putting the audience through such a
shallow and tiresome account.; She's the only worthwhile character in this whole mess, but her
predictable relationship with Tommy is never well-developed, and we're
left wondering whether they slept together or just ""made out like a
couple of teenagers"".; If I hadn't been
preparing to write a review, I would have walked out on this one.; Apparently, he
wasn't paying attention to their methods of direction, however, because
nothing appears to have rubbed off."
27857.0,Prick Up Your Ears,1999.0,":-)  Molina was
perfect as the frustrated and neglected ""wife"".; This is a solid dramatic film and one of the
     year's best.; There are many more wonderful details in this tragic story which I 
recommend highly to anyone who enjoys black comedies.; Both performances were unforgettable.; Based on clips I have seen from SID AND NANCY, I
am as impressed as the critics were with Molina's versatility.","Bald by 20.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

27994.0,Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.,1987.0,"It's also
well-sustained.; KABUKIMAN was by far the best of the bunch -- a funny, sustained,
surprisingly witty movie with a ton of good lines.; KABUKIMAN knows, and wallows happily in it.; The plot is typically Troma-weird: an NYPD detective, name of Harry
Griswold, gets involved in a massacre during a Kabuki performance and gets
the power of one of the dying players transferred to him.; I saw SGT.","KABUKIMAN in a week where I'd
suffered through an unbelievable amount of forgettable and uncompelling
big-ticket junk movies -- some of them bad but most of them just plain dull.; CAPSULE: Another great piece of nonsense from the masters of enjoyably bad

28032.0,Thumbelina,1989.0,"But the best thing is that not only is it fun--an
eminently watchable--but it's a perfect ""family film,"" capable of
pleasing both children and their parents.; Fortunately, THUMBELINA breaks this non-Disney trend,
presenting a theatrical experience that is lively and enjoyable for
both children and adults.; She lives a generally happy day-to-day life with
her human mother and several animal friends, but something is
missing--until she meets Cornelius (voice of Gary Imhoff), the Fairy
Prince.; While children most likely won't notice this, adults will,
although it shouldn't detract much from anyone's enjoyment of the
film.; One song in
particular, ""Let Me Be Your Wings"", co-written by Manilow with Bruce
Sussman and Jack Feldman (who partnered with Menken for Disney's
live-action NEWSIES), is a standout, and every bit the equal of BEAUTY
AND THE BEAST's title track or ALADDIN's ""A Whole New World.""","The same can be said of the other
characters, most of whom are animals, and none of which embarrass their
creators.; The success of THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and
ALADDIN has brought an upsurge in animated motion pictures, most of
which (ONCE UPON A FOREST and WE'RE BACK: A DINOSAUR'S STORY) border on
unwatchable.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

28033.0,Stuart Saves His Family,1994.0,"I was surprised to discover a truly entertaining, often hilarious yet
also touching little film.; For a lightweight comedy, it handles these scenes especially
well, often better than many so-called ""serious dramas"" of today.; Although filled with small, very funny scenes, Stuart Saves His Family
also has its share of dramatic moments, especially towards the
conclusion.; If you feel like renting a comedy, and you haven't seen this film, I
definitely recommend you try this one out.; It has some genuinely dramatic moments and also some genuinely
funny ones, most of which involve Stuart's flashbacks to the days he
was tormented for being an obese child.","Not only is this
latest ""Saturday Night Live"" character spinoff incoherent and
unfunny, its basic idea and tone are just appallingly wrong-headed.; Stretched out to an agonizing ninety-seven minutes, STUART
goes from being passably amusing to tedious to virtually unwatchable.; The result is a failed attempt to turn a SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE spinoff into a social commentary.; Of
course, part of the problem is the script, which suffers from a bizarre
case of split personality--this has to be the first SNL movie that
attempts to deliver a drama-based denouement.; Big mistake."
28059.0,SubUrbia,1950.0,"Parker Posey is a breath of fresh air as 
Pony's personal assistant; her optimism, tempered though it may be, 
provides a much-needed counterpoint to the cynicism of the others.; The film is wonderfully acted, with standouts by Ribissi, Zahn, and 
Katt.; But the whole cast works wonderfully.; And Linklater always seems to find the perfect everything for a scene.; There's a ton of great lines and jokes, and all the characters are 
cleverly constructed.","All in all, a generic dialogue-intensive film with no plot,
uninteresting characters (save for Ribisi) and an open ending.; Listen pal, I just invested two hours of my
time into these cheesy characters, so the least that you could do it give me
a decent payoff!; There is no real plot, just talking, which just orchestrates that these 
people have nothing to do but talk.; SUBURBIA runs way too long at 2:00.; Using the same
cutesy upper and lower cases  in the title as in  Eric
Bogosian's play does nothing for the movie."
28339.0,Hard To Die,1994.0,"Very impressive trick!; Now lets talk about the great special effects for this film.; I'm afraid folks that this
is about as good as they get.; has been presented.; While
we are on the subject of the story, the story also provides every
chance it can to disrobe an actress.","The script for this film is completely pathetic.; I'm sorry folks but this is
completely unnecessary, ridiculous, and hurts the story more (if that
is still possible).; The before mentioned three
were the only actors from part two that I thought could act, well they
seemed to have lost that ability.; Any good moments
that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story
line.; Now, we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big
plan (?!!?)"
28353.0,How to Be a Player,1999.0,"What a pleasant main character.; Anyway, Bellamy agrees to teach, and his
wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car
while he rides from house to house having sex with women.; One day, his friends decide
that they want to find out how to be a player.; Many blacks in
Hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their
race.; Be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well.","Instead
of jokes, there's just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts (and
naked breasts aren't so bad, but naked breasts alone don't make a good
movie).; Wow, a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever.; I think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves, and
stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sex-crazed
buffoons.; Amazingly, aside from Gilbert Gottfried's 90 seconds of screen time, there
was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner.; They should have brought him along
for the entire film."
28377.0,Hell Night,1992.0,"The climax, 
especially, is very frightening and well-crafted.; The story, like most films in the genre, is simple.; ""Hell Night,"" which was released in 1981 at the 
time of the big slasher film craze, is actually an effective, well-made 
picture.; Now here's a surprise!; Admittedly, ""Hell Night"" has an unoriginal story that is like any number 
of other similar slasher films, but what makes this one above-average is 
that, unlike the countless, ""Friday the 13th"" sequels, which were only 
concerned about violence and gore, ""Hell Night"" actually tries to be 
scary and suspenseful, and it surprisingly succeeds.","For their initiation 
into a fraternity, four college students agree to spend the night in the 
infamous Garth Manor, a mansion in which the family living there was 
murdered years before by the deformed son, Andrew, with the gate locked 
up so they can't escape.; Rated R (for violence, profanity, and sexual situations).; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

28384.0,Husbands and Wives,2000.0,"And it is a great movie, brilliant, sparkling, insightful, moving
and touching, thoughtful, challenging, and a whole lot more.; Juliette Lewis, who was the best thing about POINT FEAR,
is amazing and hilarious as the brilliant writing student in Allen's
class.; But anyway, this
is just one amazing film, and I highly, highly reccomend it.; All of the cast does a wonderful job and in
that aspect this film is perfect.; It's satisfying, realistic, yet still a big downer.","Allen's script also fails in the characterization.; Allen is too good a director to produce a complete bust, and
HUSBANDS AND WIVES is by no means Allen's worst film.; The primary couple
are just plain dull, and their problems and concerns are hard to
sympathize with.; The most annoying thing about 
HUSBANDS AND WIVES is that Woody tries to make the whole 
thing into a documentary, using one camera to go from person to 
person instead of cutting between cameras and sticking interviews 
with the main characters between scenes.; Director/writer Nora Ephron shows up as a ""dinner party guest"" in this film."
28387.0,Kicking and Screaming,1989.0,"It played to a surprisingly packed house at
the Commodore.; Review- This wonderful surprise was hands down the funniest movie of 1995.; Eigeman, 
whose Max is similar to characters he essayed in Metropolitan and 
Barcelona, is perfectly cast and Jason Wiles perfectly captures the 
endearing lost puppy quality of Skippy that Posey's Miami finds so 
attractive.; **** Amazing, potent stuff.; This is one of the funniest movies of the decade.","The ending of Kicking and Screaming, which doesn't even have a fade out
(the credits just suddenly start), could be viewed as an illustration of the
lack of direction that the characters have.; Josh
Hamilton (WITH HONORS) is the weakest of the performers, giving a
somewhat bland portrayal as Grover, a 22-year old would-be author with
writer's block.; When he drolly 
tells a friend on the phone (within earshot of the girl he's bedding), 
""Sorry, I can't talk now, I have to sleep with a freshman"", the director 
probably wants usto empathise with his ennui, but all I can do is wonder 
why that girl even talks to him, rather than doing something far more 
worthwhile likekneeing him in the groin.; Were this just any film with just any apparent point of illustration I
would decry the pointlessness of the movie simply stopping and leave it as
just a mildly entertaining movie.; He spends the year working in a video store 
with the most ridiculous categories fo rit's movies (terminal illness,
 dog-buddy pictures, interesting failures)."
28671.0,Habit,1997.0,"This fresh
perspective is a welcome change from more traditional treatments of the
vampire story, and is the thing that makes this movie deserve to be seen in
wider release.; His fast-paced urban lifestyle shows
that he both parties and works hard, employed as a manager in a Mexican
restaurant, who just happens to be at a difficult stage of his life at
the present moment, undergoing severe physical and mental changes, and
is saddened by the recent death of his father, whom he keeps seeing
visions of.; The direction is well-crafted and paced, and
Frank DeMarco's grainy color cinematography borders on stunning.; And the strange bloodsucking
behavior during sex... it's almost as though Anna were a... well, of course
not LITERALLY, there is no such thing, but if there were.... Several things make this film a surprisingly good sleeper.; Snaider had the
next-biggest role, and though not as strong a performer as Fessenden, she
held her own.","Said friend said that he had been let
down by far too many vampire movies to care about either the concept of
vampires or any cultural product geared towards (or stemming from) their
legacy.; For example, he had
written off the whole concept of sex in vampire movies, saying that it
was another genre of film entirely.; It is five hundred
channels of insipid cultural drivel...; But Sam's
too old to be taken care of, and by instilling that function in Anna,
and to a more fine point, deriving it from naughty sex acts, he loses
his way even further.; With his
mussed up long hair and missing front tooth, he resembles an overgrown
child whose parents have long given up trying to raise him."
28864.0,Angel Eyes,1997.0,"Fortunately, their second time together is better
than their first.; Catch (played by James Caviezel) is
first seen observing (or, perhaps, spying on) Lopez's Sharon Pogue as she
hangs out in bars and coffee shops, shooting the breeze with her peers,
Chicago's finest.; ""Angel Eyes"" is being marketted as some kind of supernatural outing, but it's
really a love story about two troubled people who find each other.; Lenser Piotr Sobocinski shifts between dark and brooding
lighting, when things are serious, to warm and soft as the romance
traverses the film story.; The
angst of the characters and their release from despair won't get the action
fans, but it will get the romantics.","Luis Mandoki's film (he made the Kevin Costner/Robin Wright sudser
""Message in a Bottle"") is another drama/mystery/thriller/romance, but those
looking for anything more than a romance (replete with delectable JLo
close-ups) will be disappointed--there's not a whole heck of a lot of drama
here, even less mystery, and virtually zero thrills.; Caveziel, however, needs to stop playing Christlike characters.; To make matters seem more artificial there is some loud,
syrupy music before the film ends and the credits roll by, as JLo and
Caviezel drive off together seemingly having survived their personal
tragedies with some big fake smiles on their faces.; I'd like to see the guy get a chance to thesp once in a while,
instead of just expressing for the camera.; Director Luis Mandoki and screenwriter Gerald DiPego tone down the saccharine 
syrup they applied liberally to their last effort, ""Message in the Bottle,"" 
but can't resist overdoing the melodrama in the home stretch of their new one."
28881.0,Wind,1995.0,"The
photography of the sailing scenes is marvelous and the races are
compelling.; Sleek and elegant, they cut
through the waves, tacking and overtaking each other heroically.; WIND is a film directed by Carroll Ballard from a script by Rudy
Wurlitzer and Mac Gudgeon taken from a story by Jeff Benjamin and Roger
Vaughan & Kimball Livingston.; The story is loosely inspired by Dennis
Connor losing and subsequently regaining the America's Cup in the 80s.; The boats are the real stars of WIND.","Modine and Grey and the others turn in reasonable performances, but the
script doesn't allow them to become interesting, engaging characters.; Most of the
overlong middle portion of the film could have been chopped with no
loss: presumably it was cheaper and easier to film in the desert.; The sailing is noteworthy (I don't know anything about sailing but
I was impressed) but the plot leaves much to be desired.; (The writers apparently think that making the supporting characters be
eccentric will make them interesting.); The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

28902.0,In Dreams,1988.0,"The nightmarish scenes seem surpassed by
cinematography techniques, allowing the story to move into the realm of
make believe Hollywood hokum rather than relying on the viewer's
imagination to do the job.; Naturally, nobody takes Claire
seriously, not her husband (who tries to) or the police (who try not
to), but when her daughter is abducted -- in the best scene of the
movie, at the elementary-school staging of ""Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs,"" performed by night in a forest  --  we see Claire go bonkers.; It was the only scene in the movie that was able to convey how
believable her panic attacks really are.; She is so sure of what she sees, that she tells her daughter
the police won't find anything there.; Dennis Schwartz: ""Ozus' World Movie Reviews"" © ALL RIGHTS RESERVED   DENNIS SCHWARTZ The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","The film
just becomes a mess and the acting is constantly shrill.; Here, he is playing the role of
Vivian Thompson, by making his villain role as campy as he could,
managing to give the impression that he is a totally evil pervert,
possibly even gay.; The Irish-born director, Jordan, whose
accomplishments include a few first-class films among some
disappointments, only proves here, that the horror thriller, perhaps, is
not what he is best suited for.; Jordan's idea
of a horror thriller, seems to be in letting the heroine to act in a
shrill voice, rather than letting the heroine's nightmare and mental
breakdown come down as something internally real.; Downey Jr. basically brought a sense of the ridiculous to
this role, allowing the film to sink lower than than the ordinary
Hollywood horror film usually does."
29076.0,Gun Shy,1999.0,"Both movies are strong, funny and
unique in their own ways.; Andy Lauer's happy-go-lucky
performance as the yuppie financial investor lends a contrasting and funny
element to the quiet tough guy cast.; * * * * - Great flick.; Still, these blemishes along with a few other highly
implausibles seem minor and just don't slow this strong, fun production.; These flashbacks are produced
beautifully and artistically.","* - One of the worst movies ever.; * * - Pretty bad.; Just because TV writer/director Eric Blakeney worked on
Moonlighting, Wiseguy, and Max Headroom does not mean he can pull off
this kind of unconventional feature film, particularly when he
presents a colonic irrigation as a romantic encounter and relies on
feeble poop jokes for laughs.; Susan Granger's review of ""GUN SHY"" (Hollywood Pictures) It's got Sandra Bullock and Liam Neeson but something went
terribly wrong with the incomprehensible script and lame direction of
this silly mob comedy.; But, if you ask me to state confidentially, the worst thing one can say
about this film, I would say that it suffered from too much flatulence."
29154.0,Stand and Deliver,1989.0,"Edward James Olmos does a wonderful job as the math teacher
who pushes his students and himself hard (perhaps too hard at times), and shows
his pupils, their parents and the school that limits, defined by class,
background and race are non-existent.; It has some complex,
entertaining characters, good acting and a story which is exciting to watch.; Their current
release is STAND AND DELIVER.; This is the story of how a math teacher in a barrio school
fought to take students who had a hard time learning fractions and turn them
into some of the country's top scorers in the advanced college placement
tests.; This film
actually shows that in one very unlikely school, math did become the ""in
thing.""","This half of
the film fails, though, to impart to the audience the magic that Escalante
worked in his class because of choppy editing and faulty construction.; These issues should be at the top of the list of any
filmmaker who wants to show the success of a teacher in a gang-ridden high
school.; Project Consultant:
Kate Long.; Americans love a success story, and the first half goes overboard trying
to oblige.; It introduces the characters and begins to show the unorthodox
teaching methods of Escalante (like bringing a machete to class)."
29461.0,Soul Food,2000.0,"Although it's very 
easy to tell who is going to screw up and why, Soul Food  still works as 
great storytelling because we know all these characters from our own 
families.; In a unexpectedly powerful moment, Ahmad takes a ride in LemUs 
truck.; Her husband Lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper 
gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving.; The
theme of having a special relationship with a loving Grandmother and
Matriarch is a winner, and when it is done without heavy-handedness like
it was in *Soul Food*, a good time will be had by all.; Yet, Soul Food is certainly a film that adults should see.","Some would say using standard family stereotypes is not 
good filmmaking.; While a few of his observations are 
insightful, most of his voiceover narrative is superfluous and even 
irritating.; United States, 1997

everything."
29621.0,Solo,2000.0,"He's the perfect solution:  disposable, replaceable, and 
stronger than 10 men.; There have 
been a lot of high-adrenaline movies this summer, but SOLO fits in more 
as a bastard stepchild than a true member of the family.; Solo 
(Mario Van Peebles), as he's called, is developing emotions.; When his commanding officer, Col. Madden (William 
Sadler), orders him to set off explosive charges with women and children 
in the proximity, Solo refuses.; No one will 
cry when he's gone.""","Worst of all, not only is SOLO totally 
devoid of originality, it's a bore.; The problem 
is, these disparate plot elements don't fit together too well, so 
screenwriter David L. Corley has forced them, sometimes in the most 
inelegant and illogical manner.; Van Peebles plays his character without much emotion, 
resulting in a personality that's as dreary as the worn-out script he's 
working with.; It's a 
dreadfully dull pastiche of moments that were fun in their original 
incarnations, but, here, have been stripped of all energy.; It's all painfully formulaic."
29786.0,North Dallas Forty,1997.0,"Truly a stunning and realistic presentation of gritty
characters and explosive personalities and definitely not a film for the
faint of heart.; The spirit of competitive action is predominant throughout 'North Dallas
Forty' and its rough edge is indicative of one of the world's most physically
demanding sports.; There are plenty of scenes on the gridiron showcasing the
dirty play that was most dominating in the 1970's and the NFL has cleaned up
its act greatly in the last 20 years and some of it may have been influenced
by this film.; Frank Yablans, the
film's producer, also scripted from Gent's novel and depicted its focus
primarily on a star wide receiver (Nick Nolte in one of his finest
performances) and his relationship with the team's front office, star
quarterback, the women in his life anda large part of the movie showcases his
performance on the football field.; The only
exception to this is the team's star quarterback (Mac Davis) who turns in a
fine performance and proved he's more than just a country and western singer.","The football team showcased in 'North Dallas Forty' is primarily made up
of macho misfits and a few wise cracking no-talents who are promptly dealt
with by the team's coach (G.D. Spradlin) who is obsessed with winning a
championship.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

29833.0,Brain Dead,1998.0,"But it's also very effective, and the Phantom thinks that it will be
much more greatly appreciated by true phans of the genre.; Of course, this theme has been touched upon by countless horror
films in the past (most popularly in the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET
series); its roots go back to the stellar DEAD OF NIGHT in 1945, a film
that predated the ""Twilight Zone"" television series by 20 years and
provided the inspiration for many of its best episodes (the Phantom is
indebted to Brandi Weed, who reminded him of this wonderful classic --
those phans who enjoy classic Zone episodes will be more than pleased by
this very early horror effort).; However, those phans who stick it out will be amply rewarded: unlike
run-of-the-mill horror films made by run-of-the-mill directors with
dreams of sequels dancing in their heads, BRAIN DEAD has a real,
believable and satisfying ending.; So imagine his surprise when he found that not only was BRAIN DEAD
a cut above the average horror film (and at least three cuts above the
cut-rate TALES), but that it was a superb example of the genre, a
little-known and limited-release gem in the rough of big budget and big
name bungles.; In the Phantom's eyes, this is what makes BRAIN DEAD a cut above
the average horror film.","I felt cheated by its
wearisome ploy of not decifering what was a dream and what was reality,
feeling more like I was being manipulated than I was at being treated to
something special.; The film didn't do much for me, as it was not worth putting in all the
effort to watch it, as the payoff seemed too little.; He had quite a selection of choice films from which to choose, and
although several of the ninja and revenge films seemed to have much to
recommend them, he chose BRAIN DEAD instead because he felt it so aptly
described the sad excuse for a horror film to which he had just been
subjected.; Sometimes this works -- HALLOWEEN and NIGHT OF THE
LIVING DEAD come to mind -- but most often it doesn't, and instead it
creates the ""7 minutes of tedium"" scenario that we've grown to loathe
but live with in the interminable FRIDAY THE 13TH SERIES: for every
killing or suspenseful scene, there is a corresponding seven minutes of
pointless dialogue and exposition (""Where's Sally?""; Before we get to the problems, though, the Phantom will attempt a
brief plot synopsis: ""It's a dream, isn't it?"""
29911.0,FairyTale: A True Story,2000.0,"FAIRYTALE also 
addresses the one area where faith is most necessary -- the great 
unknown of death.; The two girls,
shown here as almost being too storybook perfect, build a bond of
friendship.; Distributor: Paramount Pictures Fact or fiction, FAIRYTALE: A TRUE STORY is a fine motion picture.; FAIRYTALE echoes and 
amplifies that message, adding that the purity of childhood is a 
necessary ingredient to the unquestioning acceptance of things that defy 
a rational explanation.; It's a simple picture with two very likable, 
believable young protagonists and an uplifting, optimistic viewpoint.","With its severely underdeveloped script, the movie
is a big disappointment.; The true disappointment for me was that the fairies only
appear onscreen briefly, and we never get to meet any of them.; Unfortunately, this inspired attempt at a sweet
story fails on both accounts.; His
character seems too anxious to convince others to believe in the
supernatural, at one point even saying to be skeptical is to show
disrespect to him.; To claim this to be a true story
and to have special effects fairies flitting around seems less than
strictly honest, though I suppose the filmmakers are taking the
viewpoint of believers."
29918.0,Lassie,1997.0,"In the end, he loved it and wants to go back many times to see it.; It is a simple fable, well
told.; There is even an extremely sweet subplot of a romance between
the boy and a beautiful and slightly taller girl from his class.; The boy and the father wake up quickly and
become just as energetic as the females in the family.; His sister and his stepmother, on the other hand, are happy
and full of hope.","If I have had been at home and seeing this Lassie movie on TV, I
would have given up during the first 10 minutes.; The initial plot
setup and acting were too trite for me.; The
acting by the dad (Jon Tenney), stepmom (Helen Slater), son (Thomas
Guiry), daughter (Brittany Boyd), and grandfather (Richard Farnsworth)
are all good but nothing special with perhaps the exception of Thomas
Guiry plus the villain father (Frederic Forrest) and the sweetness of
the girlfriend (Michelle Williams).; LASSIE runs 1:35 and is rated PG.; What a caricature I
thought."
29932.0,Hanussen,1999.0,"One of the many happenings that make the film so fascinating is the
foretelling of the future and the hypnotism with which Schneider is
able to get people to do things such as crowing like a rooster, setting
fire to a curtain.; The film, based on a true story, is of a soldier, Karl Schneider, lying
on the battlefield, physically and psychologically wounded.; Ironic and strongly anti-war scene
it is in the opening few minutes.; It's 92 now.; When his fame spreads and reaches into the highest ranks of the Nazis
and Hitler becomes aware of him, Hanussen's life is in danger.","The next day the stock drops to 25.; As a voice-over intones ""Our Father Who art in Heaven...."", the camera
pans across hundreds of infantrymen in trenches, guns pointed in front
of them.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; His act consists of reading questions written on paper by
members of the audience."
30120.0,Whoops Apocalypse,,"In their respective times both were probably deliciously dark comedies.; But today they both, especially the movie version, weirdly resonate with a
dark foreboding that its creators might admire but could never have
imagined.; a never too deceased
Leonoid Breshznev and the idea of a Labour Government were the funniest
things around.; All this is presented as a warm fuzzy photo op.; I suspect this will appear on HBO or Showtime sometime soon (if it hasn't
already).","The ""demo"" tape cpntains an 80's version of a
politically incorrect gallery of thugs who supposedly hired Lacrobate to
do their dirty work.; The movie version aims its invective at petty Conservative Prime
Ministers, air head Royals, pointless wars in the South Atlantic and the
endless machinations of world governments who ought to know better.; The unintended message of ""Whoops Apocalypse"" seems to be that though the
nuclear demon's threat of global destruction has decreased it has been
replaced by a world wide homogenization of evil that guarantees each of us
a personalized dose of terror rather than a world wide global catastrophe.; In spite of the jokes that have no shelf life, the movie version of
""Whoops Apocalypse"" starts to become very creepy, as we realize that the
90's have rendered the greed and rapaciousness of the 80's rather mute.; I believe in both versions the Assassin tries to impress everyone by
holding his manhood over a candle flame, ""It's not that it doesn't hurt,
it's that I don't mind the pain,""  he warbles."
30157.0,Amateur,1997.0,"Hal Hartley's latest film, AMATEUR, is quite a departure from his
earlier work.; I think this is a fantastic movie to see in the mix of blockbuster
summer fare.; It is very revealing and adds to the
enjoyment of watching his films.; And while that analogy is not entirely accurate, it does best
point at what makes AMATEUR so much more wildly enjoyable than his
previous works and more accessible.; To those who aren't familiar with Hal Hartley's past works
(UNBELIEVABLE TRUTH, TRUST, SIMPLE MEN), AMATEUR is the best flick to
get acquainted with this young and talented director.","As best I could figure out, the movie appears to be an attempt at a
parody of a bad movie.; The
other so called actors seem not to care enough to attempt much acting.; With this script, who can blame them.; AMATEUR runs way too long at 1:45.; There was a tiny
bit of blood, some discussions of sex, and no nudity that I can
remember."
30265.0,Chinese Box,1997.0,"Gong Li is a beautiful, talented actress, and is wonderful here in a
quiet, understated way.; The atmosphere is eerie and very
effective.; This is a stately and poetic
scene that gives a glimpse into Hong Kong's fragility.; It also keeps the film in John's perspective,
and this is a good decision because it keeps the setting foreign, and
even a little bit threatening.; This scene is perfect moviemaking, and is strong
mostly because of the acting.","The obvious allegory is,
unfortunately, not as well developed as it might be; at least, much of the
plot doesn't seem to support the allegory in any intelligible way.; Unfortunately, Wang chooses to plunge 
viewers into a soap opera, a decision which robs CHINESE BOX of much of 
its potential power.; But just how little dialogue she is
given is beyond ridiculous: ""What?; On the other hand, Wang and company, as
much as they wanted to make a Hong Kong story, were obviously straining for
an idea; as such, what should have been the emotional hook of Chinese Box
is forced and unconvincing, rendering that talent-heavy film shockingly
impotent.; Irons is lifeless in this role, and his 
uninspired performance does little to draw us into John's world."
30366.0,Leningrad Cowboys Meet Moses,2001.0,"The songs in general aren't as good as they were in
LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO AMERICA, but there some really good pieces, like
""The Rivers of Babylon"" and a great rock'n'roll song performed by the
French (?); IMHO, the best song was the
version of Finnish lullaby ""The Goblin and the Sun Ray""--damn, it
almost made me cry.; Matti Pellonp{{ (who played the part of the despotic manager
Vladimir in LENINGRAD COWBOYS GO AMERICA) steals the whole show with
his Moses/Vladimir character.; Still, I would say that LENINGRAD COWBOYS MEET MOSES is better
than its reputation and give it three stars [***] out of the five,
because we should keep in mind that: The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; The
movie gets more ""road movie"" like feeling and there are more music
performances.","The first half of the movie is actually boring as hell.; Well, was it all that bad?; It is understandable
that people don't like comedy that is not funny at all.; It was said
that the worst rock'n'roll group in the world got the movie that is
worth the band.; Nothing
really happens and the band performs only one song (which is quite
funny, though)."
30416.0,Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures,1980.0,"Fittingly, it's 
Christiane, who he fell in love with while directing her in PATHS OF GLORY, 
that gets the film's great final line.; A LIFE IN PICTURES is more than a 
homage; it's also a gift.; As it's directed by Kubrick's brother-in-law Jan 
Harlan, and features interviews with his sister, daughters and widow 
Christiane, it's reasonable to expect a personal account of Kubrick 'the 
man'.; )are priceless - it comes 
full circle when we see him filming his own children.; It 
was impossible for Kubrick to be innovative for every new film (which may 
explain the increasing gaps between each new project) but A LIFE IN PICTURES 
also reminds us that his work nevertheless remained unique, copying from no 
other cinema product before it; even a practise as basic as the use of 
established music can be traced back to his incorporation of Vera Lynn in DR 
STRANGELOVE and Strauss in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

30910.0,Went to Coney Island on a Mission From God... Be Back by Five,,"When the two friends go in search of Richie, in the deserted winter
landscape of Coney Island, we see in flashbacks all the disappointments
in their lives that led to their current despair and what bonded them
together and why this search becomes a spiritual odyssey for them.; Fortunately, a number of
lighter moments (and a memorable by Frank Whaley as a Skee-Ball
attendant) make the film quite watchable, not to mention keeping you, as
a viewer, from slitting your wrists thanks to all the melancholy.; Who would have thought that the life of Jon Cryer -- actor in such
memorable films as Hiding Out and Morgan Stewart's Coming Home -- would
be such fertile ground for based-on-a-true-story filmmaking?; Danny is the timid one who works as an appraiser for a
jewelry store, a respectable job but the store operates much like a
pawnbroker's, and he feels unsatisfied with his position but thinks he's
lucky to have it.; Richie has a chemical imbalance and chooses to be a
homeless person, with sparks of memory coming back to him, but because
of his sexual problems and guilt-trip over his sister's car accident,
and because he refuses to take his medicine to treat his condition, he
can't function as a normal person any longer.","It was also done in by a needless
subplot of Stan getting into gambling debts and being beaten, which just
seemed like padding to a thin story.; And an
unethusiastic waitress, with a scowl, who serves them hotdogs without
any relish.; Too much of the film seemed to have
no place to go, just like misinformed tourists who go to Coney in the
winter to see the idle Cyclone ride.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

30923.0,Alice in Wonderland,1997.0,"""Alice in Wonderland"" is a Disney animated feature that
is better than its reputation.; It is not as great as
some of the Disney features that preceded it, such as
""Snow White"", ""Dumbo"", or ""Pinocchio"", but there is
still considerable charm in the animation, story,
and voice characterizations.; She fantasizes about a world where animals talk and
things aren't so logical, and finds herself in that
world.; The animation is quite good.; This is in keeping
with the spirit of Carroll's writings, which have
the useful moral that gullibility is punished.","The audience is supposed to feel
sorry for her, but this cold-hearted reviewer merely
lost interest.; She is determined to learn more about
a frazzled white rabbit, a search that leads to encounters
with various extremely silly characters.; There is also a song that the flowers sing
to Alice that isn't that interesting.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; There are some slow parts to the story."
30949.0,Palmetto,1998.0,"Confidential,"" easily the best film of 1997, is a 
wonderful piece of contemporary neo-noir filmmaking.; It's not a 
classic by any means, but it sure is quite an engaging surprise.; One of the best small twists occurs when
Harry is first brought in by the police after they find out about the
kidnapping.; We've seen
examples of deadpan noir (an Ebert term applicable to ""Destiny Turns on the
Radio""), farce noir (""Clay Pigeons,"" ""Fargo""), revisionist noir (""Pulp
Fiction,"" and a slew of rip-offs), old-fashioned, hard-boiled detective noir
(""L.A.; Further grounding the story in reality, Gina
Gershon gives a rock solid performance as his blowtorch wielding,
sculptor girlfriend with whom he lives.","It was a waste of $6.50.; Avoid this nonsense and go see ""L.A.; Kingpin, one of
the worst comedies of all time, features Harrelson in an unsympathetic
role as another terrible guy.; Secondly, 
the guy is as dumb as a wooden post.; To make 
matters worse, Schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character's 
lips are running over each others bodies."
30950.0,Metroland,1992.0,"Great people.; ""I think you will,"" she tells him.; Absent these two, relatively minor criticisms, the film
is an astute and intriguing story loaded with subtle but quite
impressive acting.; Love, Toni.""; Those expecting to see a lot of
the great Emily Watson will be disappointed, but METROLAND gives her a
chance to restrain herself, as she plays a character not nearly as
animated as her previous ones.","The former is dull and dingy, and the latter is bland
and uninspired.; Chris, as a bohemian, was too pathetic to seriously believe and not
funny enough to laugh at.; But that's not
to say that the film was so terrible that it can't be seen, that would
not be true, since it is not so bad as it is a case of it being so dull
that it negates any enjoyment value.; The worst line in the movie is when Chris realizes he has a good thing
going with Marion and tells her his reason for not fooling around with
another woman, ""Who wants fast-food if you can eat at the Ritz.""; Why Toni is a poet, we have to take as a
statement of fact coming from the filmmaker, because he appears like an
obnoxious jerk and an actor who is badly miscast, and there was no
evidence given in the film that he shows even enough intelligence to
spell poet, let alone to even consider him to be a poet."
31044.0,My Favorite Year,2000.0,"""My Favorite Year"" is not a great film, but
it is an entertaining comedy that provides several
memorable characters.; The off-and-on humor
makes for half of a great movie, which is a much
larger portion than most comedies have.; The basic story is good,
and the film is well-cast.; But some of the gags are very funny, especially O'Toole
crashing a party by swinging down from a fire hose.; Mel Brooks produced ""My Favorite Year"", and the
story idea came from his experiences with Errol Flynn
when he was a young comic writer on the Sid Caesar show.","However, the film
does drag in the middle, some scenes don't quite
work, and there is an unnecessary mobster subplot.; His staff includes young comic
writer Benjy Stone (Mark Linn-Baker), whose love
interest is gopher Jessica Harper.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
31067.0,Fail-Safe,1996.0,"Still powerful today,
even after the end of the cold war.; Again, this is achieved through Groeteschele, who is easily
the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme
significance.; With the help of his
translator Buck (Larry Hagman), the President negotiates at length with the
Soviet leader, in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their
simplicity, with Lumet's long takes of Fonda and Hagman in the same frame,
exchanging the dialog between the President and the Soviet leader.; Nevertheless, under
Lumet's direction and Walter Bernstein's intelligent adaptation of
Burdick's and Wheeler's novel, the film continues to have a lasting effect
even after the events on screen have unfolded.; In addition to providing the central ""pro-nuclear war"" voice
that the film warns against, he also makes key remarks about Communists
that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone
to when it came to communism.","(Just *how* does one pass
off the deaths of millions of people as an *mishap*?); The unidentified
aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner, but a mechanical failure
strikes the military base that commands the bombers.; Why continue to build such machines of mass destruction
while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times
over?; The idea--and perhaps the only real
option--is to avoid war at all costs.; Is it even logical?"
31174.0,Richard III,1948.0,"This is a
fascinating interpretation of Shakespeare's portrait of our most
villainous king; and Sir Ian McKellen is awesome in the lead.; This film captures all the mood of the
original play, and makes Richard of Gloucester into one of the great
screen villains, wonderfully portrayed by the underrated Ian McKellen.; This play tells of the machinations of
Richard (Ian McKellan), a royal prince with a twisted spine and
grotesque physical appearance, to place himself in power.; But the bits that Hollywood would enjoy,
that the play has, like the asides, really are what makes this film so
enjoyable.; And the ending is wonderfully funny (with Richard's
line ""A Horse!","I am sorry to say that it has massive smoking for no purpose.; The well-honed dialogue and intimate camerawork 
would have been enough without the soap-opera-like interludes.; I was excited when the Bayreuth production of Wagner's
RING OF THE NIBELUNGS was to be broadcast in this country, but when all
of the fantasy was sucked out by staging it in late 19th Century dress,
I decided that I was not really so anxious to see it after all.; According to 
him, none of them can do anything without turning it into a performance.; She heads a cast that doesn't have many weak 
participants."
31306.0,Crazy in Alabama,1988.0,"And if you stay with the film and
give up being a critic and just let yourself have fun, by the end I
think you'll find that in its own way it has its charm.; It also gives Lucas
Black--Peejoe in the movie--license to get thick and heavy with Southern
dialect, which he does as well as anybody and better than most.; Add to that an excellent ensemble of
supporting actors, including the always effective David Morse, the
surprising Meatloaf and the scene-stealing antics of the 'contender's brothe
r, Rod Steiger.; Simple stuff.; I think the most credit has to be given to the
director in this case, who was able to juggle the two plot lines with great
aplomb, and bring out solid performances from all of his players.","It was SOOO bad!""; Does this abysmal movie have any saving grace?; As a movie about growing up
in the racial turmoil of the 1960s, it might have succeeded--there's some
good material there--but as is, there's another movie edited in, and it's
difficult to tell which is supposed to be primary.; A cinematic hash of stale ingredients lifted from
other movies, CRAZY IN ALABAMA includes a wacky woman, a cheesy chase, a
racial rebellion, an aspiring actress and stupid-sounding Southerners.; After all, did we really need to have to 
sit through another stock courtroom scene?"
31357.0,Waiting to Exhale,1999.0,"Ladies, go and enjoy this 
movie.; Of the quartet of stories, Bernadine's is the most compelling.; Standout sequences include a hilariously frank sex scene 
and the early show-stopper of Angela Bassett torching her hubby's 
BMW.; It's no coincidence that this character is played by Angela Bassett, the 
best actress in the cast.; All of them are looking for love in all the 
wrong places with all the wrong people, but rest assured the movie 
does end for the most part happily, with uncredited performances from 
Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines livening things up.","The message of 
""needing a man to make me happy"" is inappropriate, sure, but no 
worse than, say, the legions of big-gun testosterone poisoners that 
teach violence as a method of problem-solving.; Neither of these stories is of more 
than passing interest, and the movie slows to a crawl when Houston or 
Rochon takes center stage.; Further,
while it is not written in The Ten Commandments that every film about
blacks should be meaningful in the sense that films by Spike Lee are,
it would still be nice if the film did not have 4 women who, whatever
the reason, smoked, drank, went to bed with men after a slight meeting,
held conversations that were always sexual and whose lives seemed to be
devoted only to finding ""a man.""; With the exception of Bernadine, I never felt anything 
for the women populating this film, as they failed to capture my 
interest or sympathy.; Only one of the 
characters (Loretta Devine) consistently acts responsible, and 
she's the least-glamorous of the lot."
31413.0,Innocence,1998.0,"The obviously experienced and
intelligent cast is excellent, performing even the most intimate scenes of
reawakened sexuality with understated dignity and discretion.; This is a perfect sentiment for our times.; The sometimes surprising story is
wonderfully moving without being overly sentimental and completely honest while
avoiding cheap theatrics.; ""Love.; Although they may be
in their waning years, the movie's seventyish characters demonstrate a palpable
zest for the essence of life and love.","and inept editing.; (Truth be told,
the flashbacks are the biggest problem with the film, taking up too much
time showing a young couple almost void of any real personality.); All 
three main characters over-analyze their situations to obscene standards, and 
use lots of big words.; A pall is cast on the whole
affair.; More unnecessary scenes and dialogue pile 
up as it goes on."
31503.0,My Boyfriend's Back,1999.0,"Director Bob
Balaban has fun blending fantasy, comedy, and parody together, and does
a surprisingly smooth job of it.; The
nonchalant way that everyone treats Johnny's return is clever and
enjoyable to watch.; It's surprising how good the cast is.; They are proud of their son's achievement, but
determined to do everything necessary to keep things normal.; Now, with the
approach of the Senior Prom, Johnny finally gets up the courage to ask
Missy out.","I recognize that the people behind MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK are
trying to do something positive, but comparing the plight of the
undead--a truly ridiculous situation to begin with--to the bigotry
faced by many minorities is more than just a bad idea; it's
insensitive.; If only his script had more bite,
this could have been a worthwhile film.; However, as idiotic as it is, MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
is not without a few redeeming qualities.; There is an anti-racist, anti-prejudice message that doesn't
work.; I would never argue that MY
BOYFRIEND'S BACK is a good movie, nor would I recommend it to anyone,
but it's not nearly as awful as the title would suggest, and there are
at least a few worse pictures available at the moment."
31504.0,Little Big League,1998.0,"The interesting thread that flows through the film deals with how
the pressure to win can quell the simple fun and enjoyment of playing
the game.; The
eleven-year old takes his new role very seriously--so seriously, in
fact, that when he fires the current manager, he decides to come down
from the front office and manage the Twins himself.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; It comes as something of a
surprise to everyone, however, when, after Granddad's death, the will
reveals that the baseball team has been bequeathed to Billy.; The smile and youthful enthusiasm are gone.","Unfortunately, the resolution of this situation is simplistic and
disappointing.; The
lack of salty language is as obvious as the lack of enthusiasm, and
there's far too much culture and civility.; The most serious failing of LITTLE BIG LEAGUE is the screenplay.; The first half of the motion
picture is especially poor, as characters and situations are introduced
in contrived fashion.; There is
no sense of spontaneity, and none of the actors gives a strong enough
performance to transcend this limitation."
31535.0,Chairman of the Board,1995.0,"One day, he meets an old man (Jack
Warden) with a shared love for inventions and surfing.; CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, without a doubt, deserves each and every
one.; Sharing a passion for more than just riding waves, Armand is
deeply impacted by the young inventor's notebook of dreams and ideas, and when
the old man dies soon afterward, Edison learns he is named a benefactor in
Armand's will.; - Matt Williams (matt@shreck.com)
Reviewer for Shreck's Cinema: http://www.shreck.com
Home of over 500 reviews, and information on over 600 upcoming releases The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; She certainly went beyond the call of duty
- she has to kiss Carrot Top!!!!!!","A gimmicky
prop comic, Carrot Top (aka Scott Thompson), lacks even the range of
thespian Pauly Shore, and the film's meager compliment of jokes fails to
even be amusing in a bad way.; A movie this bad speaks for itself.; The script is 100%
recycled, the direction is hokey, and the acting is absolutely horrible.; The film's pathetic attempts are so brainless that they're too
stupid to be considered stupid-but-funny.; How about an overly exhausted, paper
thin plot approached with utter incompetence?"
31546.0,American Buffalo,1991.0,"Flaws and all, the film is excellent, and I recommend it and
give it ***.; David Mamet is one of the most brilliant of today's playwrights
and screenwriters.; Here is where I begin to have problems with
the film and where I find it one of my least favorite, albeit still
excellent, works of Mamet's.; As a film, AMERICAN BUFFALO is not spectacular,
but it brings a great play to a wider audience, and that alone makes it
noteworthy.; All of the people give fine performances.","Does he need the money badly 
enough to put up with all this aggravation?; In fact, the main
failing of the film is that too often it becomes tedious and little
more than a mechanism for delivering some admittedly fine lines.; There is a slight weak link
in Sean Nelson, who made an electrifying debut in 1994's FRESH but appears
to have grown more self-conscious; he clearly never quite gets a handle on
Mamet-speak.; ""Nothing, I'm just talking.""; It is rated R for frequent bad
language."
31579.0,God Told Me To,1994.0,"Often thrilling, funny, exciting and tense, ""God Told Me To"" is one hell of a ride for a B movie.; Cohen elicits good performances from all his
actors, especially tough character actor Tony Lo Bianco in the lead role and
Sylvia Sidney, who plays a mysterious old woman who holds an important key to
Nicholas' past.; However, only those
who are intensely religious will be offended; the rest of us can just smile at
the film's simple and entertaining absurdity.; This deeply affects Nicholas because of his own strong religious background.; For more reviews, check out JERRY AT THE MOVIES at http://buffs.moviething.com/buffs/faust/ E-mail me with any questions, comments or general complaints at Faust667@aol.com or at jerry@movieluver.com The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","It's just that its aspirations seemed to be emanating from an A movie.; Cohen seems to have the right ideas, but
he lacks the patience and drive to bring it all together.; There is the absurdity of ""It's Alive"" and the pointlessness of ""The Stuff,"" one of the worst films of the 1980's.; Or did these sudden killers just snap?; Like many of Cohen's films, ""God Told Me To"" is cemented in an interesting idea,
but the final product seems more like a hastily thrown-together mosaic of
scenes, rather than a satisfying whole."
31582.0,Flawless,1999.0,"He's very good!; And it is Hoffman's
performance that is really flawless - he makes his affinity for Hollywood
starlets very inviting.; Philip Seymour Hoffman, so adept in his
role as the sexually inhibited Allen in Todd Solondz's
""Happiness,"" is often so convincing that a viewer entering this
movie late could swear he was a woman.; In ""Flawless,"" De Niro plays a paralyzed
cop, and this echoes memories of the mental patient he played in ""Awakenings,""
yet surprisingly his role here is overcome by the dazzling Philip Seymour
Hoffman.; Hoffman can easily add
this character to his memorable turns in ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Happiness"" - this
is an actor I will keep an active watch for the in the future.","Unfortunately,
the director does not yet appear to have either the confidence or
ability to helm a project which requires such depth; hence, we're
treated to countless gay stereotypes and unimaginative plot twists
(Stolen drug money?; Koontz on the other hand, is dull, plodding and bigoted.; But even that's not enough -- as a
screenwriter, Schumacher can't say 'no' -- so every 15 minutes or so
""Flawless"" cuts away from the stormy Rusty/Walter relationship to a
completely incongruous subplot about stolen drug money and murdered
hookers.; As Rusty, a drag queen who badly
wants to be surgically transformed into ""a real woman,"" Hoffman huffs
and puffs and sometimes blows everyone else off the screen, as if he's
certain he can somehow turn this shabby stick figure of a character into
Mama Cass.; To
make matters worse, writer/director Joel Schumacher (8mm) continues to
use the building's robbery as a continuing subplot throughout the film."
31610.0,Trixie,1987.0,"A Sony Pictures Classic release.; More recently 
""Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle"" (1994)  (about Dorothy Parker 
and the Algonquin Round Table ) was exceptionally good,.; His nearly 20  films are a mixed bag, with some 
among those he was able to write and direct --as opposed to having to 
hire out to others as a director--having a nice following, notably 
""Remember my Name"" (1978) and ""Choose Me,"" (1984).; The first
half-hour is solid and moves with purpose.; If you can think of Trixie's
condition as a mental disease, a ""Rain Man""-kind of syndrome, then you'll
feel more sympathetic towards her character.","The film was mildly enjoyable, but
could have been much better if Rudolph tried to put a coherent story
together instead of just going for cheap comedy.; Any
one member of this capable cast should have taken a look at his sorry
script and realized it just wouldn't play in Peoria (or anywhere else for
that matter).; Don't be
tricked into spending your entertainment dollar for this
self-indulgent garbage.; The last hour and half
simply sink under the movie's, and Rudolph's, pretentious voice.; This is
not a particularly original idea, of course, but Rudolph overwrites it as
if he's just invented the palindrome."
31611.0,White Man's Burden,1997.0,"What follows is a compelling, thought-provoking study of racism and
the frightening economic and societal realities it can create.; While he stops a little
short on pushing the film to its limit, it's still a nearly flawless
example of how modern cinema ought to be done, unadulterated by Hollywood
glitz and driving its message home with a hammer.; The comic relief is very well-done, also, and the film never
wallows into the hopeless despair that other ""victim of circumstance""
stories tend to do.; This is one
very rich, high society family.; Nakano's
script is masterful at challenging every preconceived notion we have, and
Oscar-deserving performances by Travolta and Belafonte really bring his
words to life.","The idea of a relationship developing between a kidnapper and his
victim is nothing new, and not much of interest is added here.; About twenty minutes into the movie it became clear what point
writer/director Desmond Nakano wished to make:  What if black people
changed places with white?; In order to make it clear what's going on--that the blacks are
the ""haves"" and the whites are the ""have nots""--WHITE MAN'S BURDEN
falls into a pattern of gross stereotyping and oversimplification.; The director is so busy pointing to skin color
that he loses sight of the characters under the pigmentation.; It's a clever gimmick, but,
ultimately, as depicted in WHITE MAN'S BURDEN, that's all it is."
31643.0,Jimmy Hollywood,1999.0,"The best part of JIMMY HOLLYWOOD, and it is very good, is the
sequence over which the end credits are shown.; Jimmy Alto (Joe Pesci) moved to Hollywood from New Jersey to try
his luck in Tinseltown.; When he makes another appearance, Jimmy takes
matters into his own hands, giving birth to the S.O.S.; When the public begins expressing appreciation for the vigilantes,
Jimmy begins to play the role for all it's worth, to the dismay of
long-suffering girlfriend Lorena (Victoria Abril).; If there has been one theme one can identify running through the
work of director Barry Levinson, it is the search for the American
Dream.","Unfortunately, the idea is all
that Mr. Levinson had, because the final result--JIMMY HOLLYWOOD--is
a somnolent mess.; I just found none of
them truly engaging.; It is typical of Levinson to make his heroes' motives less
than completely pure, but in this instance they're simply muddled.; There are interesting ideas in the script, and some of
the dry humor characteristic of Levinson's dialogue, but it's never all
that compelling because the character of Jimmy Alto is too
schizophrenic, and with him the tone of the whole film.; The fault is not entirely that of the
script, since none of the principals gives a noteworthy performance."
31776.0,Where the Money Is,1999.0,"Newman is great, as
he always is, funny, sarcastic and always entertaining.; The flick does...) Until
the lady manages to crack the man's shell, this flick is a very sexy and
very funny good time.; The flick does...) Until
the lady manages to crack the man's shell, this flick is a very sexy and
very funny good time.; Points also go out to Fiorentino, who had up until
recently been relegated to roles featuring her gruffy voice and fine legs
(this film also focuses on her booty), scoring with a solid performance of a
down-and-out small town nurse looking for a way out of her hum-drum life.; Fiorentino is also a fun
presence.","The only thing worse than a dumb movie is a dumb movie that clocks in at
two hours.; It's not that it was intended that way but director Marek
Kanievska and writers E. Max Frye, Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright (why
did it take three people to write this?); Any actor needs some material to work with, and the
screenplay by the writing committee of E. Max Frye, Topper Lilien and
Carroll Cartwright is sorely lacking in plot and character development.; The whole concept of Carol's character was an insult to this 
viewer; I never took her seriously, and for the life of me, couldn't 
figure out why Wayne or Henry would, either.; I did not believe a single thing 
they were trying to ""sell"", not for a moment--partially because my 
husband works in Corrections and I know (at least in our state) that It 
Just Doesn't Work That Way--but mostly because I did not feel the actors 
believed it either."
31908.0,Ghosts of Mississippi,1996.0,"The supporting cast was
good and Reiner's directing is solid.; DeLaughter, is a perfect
character to pick up this cross.; Now, 30 years later, Evers' widow, (Whoopi Goldberg), after a
nearly solitary struggle to get the case reopened, has finally
managed to get a little bit of action out of the State's
Attorney's office.; His acting, together with a
strong supporting cast, makes for a good film.; Whoopi Goldberg gives an uneven performance as Myrlie 
Evers, starting out rather unconvincingly, but finishing strong.","Either poor acting or poor directing, but something
definitely went wrong.; Why was it boring?; Life itself is boring as shit.; But I was watching this movie and
thinking, ""This is boring.""; That sucks."
31987.0,Don Quixote,1997.0,"Most Famous of these is THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE WIND, tied up in a legal dispute with Iranian financiers.; Soon, however, Don Quixote comes into
conflict not only with sheep and windmills, but with the modern world.; As Welles places himself in
the narrative, we also see how he identifies with the knight, and
considers his own immortality through his filmmaking.; He decides that he is to become a
knight errant himself, and, accompanied by his squire Sancho Panza
(Akim Tamiroff), sets off to do great deeds in the name of his
idealized love Dulcinea.; Sancho runs with the bulls in Pamplona, discovers television, and even
finds himself being captured on film by the great director Orson
Welles.","The rest, the mixture of poor
quality footage, lacks any sense of pacing or focus.; It is difficult to tell if some lines
are supposed to be narration or dialogue.; His team added a flat and hollow track
of bored actors trudging through the dialogue, making no effort to
match the lips of characters.; Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza are not even the same characters from one scene to the
next, and at times the appalling modern voiceovers are simply
laughable.; It
is an incredibly poor dubbing job that would not pass muster in a
kung-fu film."
32042.0,Night Moves,1987.0,"Both
Melanie Griffith and Jennifer Warren are making their first film with
him and he is really turning them on to the way film works.""; The title seems to be a reference to chess, as Harry discusses several
""knight moves"" while reenacting a famous chess match from years past.; He's
especially good with people who have never made a picture before.; There's a quote from an interview with Gene
Hackman that states ""Arthur Penn is a great director because he sees the
special human moment in a scene, outside the dialogue, outside the
scenery; he sees the human animal, he sees the life of the scene.; He
catches on whenever any information is given to him.","That's a odd statement to make, since it's not as if all this
information is presented to Harry and he just doesn't catch on.; Much of the
movie does take place at night however, so maybe that's what it's
referring to.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
32054.0,Hope and Glory,1994.0,"That sort of subtlety is rare in current cinema and is what
makes HOPE AND GLORY a true classic.; HOPE AND GLORY offers a unique, startling, and funny child's-eye view of
life duing the Blitz.; It's a
delightful film that is thoroughly entertaining because it draws richly, and
quite paradoxically, from its seemingly serious subject matter.; The
depth of Boorman's portrayal of these children, as well as the other
characters, is one that can only come from cherished and heartfelt personal
memories.; The beauty of HOPE AND GLORY is that its satire is so deeply submerged
beneath the film's truly funny and nostalgic story that it is unapparent on
casual viewing.","Unfortunately, partway through the film seems to lose some of its
vision.; Art Director:
Don Dossett.; But beyond this vision,
there is little in the way of plot, and despite fine acting and a deft,
economic staging, the movie must be carried by the characters, whom ultimately
I found stilted and unconvincing.; At this moment, the audience inwardly groans because it
expects a tiresome speech from Clive about how Billy is now going to be the man
in the house, how Billy must now grow up and shoulder more responsibility.; Co-Producer: Michael
Dryhurst."
32074.0,Company Business,1993.0,"The ironic performances of
Hackman and Baryshnikov are charming, if not exactly engrossing.; The film's observations of
the difficulties of certain types to adjusting to this new world provide
the most interest and could have developed into a true political satire.; It is a pleasant entertainment, nicely
photographed, competently acted, with some touches of satire and humor;
but for one thing events in the real world, such as it is, have so far
outstripped the script as to make it an historical curiosity and not the
terribly au courant statement of this particular brave new world.; The subway sequence, for example,
is as close to thrilling as the movie gets.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Loss
of nerve, I call it.; For
another, the story is complicated and the complications take too long to
be set up in the beginning.; Some of you might enjoy this film at matinee prices, but in general
I really cannot recommend it except as a cheap, future rental.; Half true insofar as it is indeed set in the post-cold war environment,
but it hardly thrills.; I
think, by the way, that this might be the first time I've seen Misha in
a film in which he did no dancing at all."
32117.0,Aprile,1997.0,"Another theme is his procrastination.; The movie is in Italian with English subtitles.; Some of the film's most endearing images are those of Moretti with his
infant son.; ""Don't cry like that,"" he tells his son.; Part of the film's humor surrounds Moretti's insecurity.","It
is not rated but might be PG-13 for some language and one brief scene of
pot smoking and would be acceptable for kids around 11 and up.; One of Moretti's assistants on the documentary
tries to blow cigarette smoke over the pasta, but it looks fake.; A
mother can supply milk to quiet the child, but a father has no such
weapon in his arsenal.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

32274.0,Cradle Will Rock,,"While CRADLE WILL ROCK plays a little fast and loose with history,
it still is an enjoyable watch and one of the best films of the year.; This is one of the very best films of
the year, a sweeping, enjoyable, thought-provoking epic that respects,
educates and entertains the audience all at the same time.; ...and it all works like a gem.; The film is witty, entertaining and different.; However, Tim Robbins does a
great job of tying all of this neurotic, erratic hypertension together
in the end so that it inevitably tells a story of hope and survival for
such an often taken-for-granted ideal as freedom of speech.","I
would be inclined to suggest that you just wait for the video and use
the fast forward to get to the good parts, but this would require you to
fast forward through almost the entire picture, making it not worth the
cost.; But the biggest disappointment are the portrayals of Welles and Houseman,
presented as nothing more than two arrogant, one-dimensional boors.; I thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding
cast, unfortunately are all uninteresting, except for a few.; Emily Watson, a gifted actress,
is dull to watch in this film - the transition from the homeless, sympathetic
Olive Stanton to a whimpering cipher does not make for a full-bodied character.; The
whole film is like this, and it's basically nothing but a headache."
32284.0,Dream for an Insomniac,1996.0,"I also think ambiguous endings in love stories work, as is
the case with Mike Nichols' fabulous ""The Graduate.""; Delightful
from start to finish, with a real-life take on young men and women in love,
one would hope that it gets the wide distribution it deserves.; There are revelations that can be seen coming from miles ahead of the cinema
meter.; Roman Polanski once said that the best love stories are the tragic ones.; Frankie is convinced that once she leaves for L.A. with her best friend,
Allison (Jennifer Aniston), she will find her dreamboat, someone with ""the soul
of a poet and eyes like Frank Sinatra.""","""Dream for an Insomniac"" is fabricated, dull, formulaic, unsurprising, dishonest
nonsense.; She plays the best friend, which is a considerable waste of her talents
since she does the exact same role on her famous sitcom.; And what
kind of man is that supposed to be?; ""Dream for an Insomniac"" is
your standard, cookie-cutter formula crap where the happy ending is not only
forced but also downright shameful.; Watching Cassevettes regular Cassel spouting cliche-ridden dialogue is
enough cause for a Cassevettes retrospective."
32325.0,Mi vida loca,1998.0,"MY CRAZY LIFE shows that existence, that entrapment.; MI VIDA LOCA's insight into human nature is as keen as that of any
other film with an inner city perspective, and this is a rare attempt
to present the women's point-of-view.; 1992 saw the debuts of two incredible American filmmakers.; Her GAS FOOD LODGING possessed the
refreshing quality of emotional honesty.; The abrupt ending is stunning, and recalls the kind of impact than
Anders is capable of making.","What keeps this from being a better film is that it is an apologia
for the gangs.; What do they know about rearing babies and where will they get the
money?; The second, with a more low-key, yet no less effective
effort, was Allison Anders.; The voiceover at the time--""Women don't
use weapons to prove a point.; One of the main problems here is that there are too many characters to
develop, so none gets much in-depth presentation."
32519.0,Kiss Me Guido,1998.0,"Unlike painting and literature, the cinema both gives to life
and takes from it..."" The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Both of them are comfortable with who they 
are, and first-time writer/director Vitale doesn't cheat us by forcing 
their relationship to cross into the sexual realm.; Good, because it has fun with some commonly held impressions of certain 
groups (gays, Italian Americans, and Jews).; KISS ME, 
GUIDO is uneven, but, for those who can enjoy a motion picture with a 
multiplicity of flaws, this one offers some smiles and laughs during the 
course of its generally undemanding 90 minute running length.; Sure, some of the gags are funny, but the price 
is that we never really accept Frankie or Warren as a real person, and 
we're always conscious that we're watching a movie.","Unfortunately, the answer comes courtesy of a clunky script that reduces 
the characters to one-dimensional stereotypes and assumes that the 
audience will accept any contrivance, no matter how unlikely, as long as 
it moves the story along.; The biggest problem with KISS ME, GUIDO is that the screenplay 
dumbs down its protagonists to sit-com level.; Both Nick Scotti and 
Anthony Barrile are competent, but it would be interesting to see them 
in roles that require a little more range.; Take, for example, the reason that Italian stallion Frankie (Nick 
Scotti), a confirmed homophobe, and ""100% Grade A queer"" Warren (Anthony 
Barrile) end up in a situation where they're considering rooming 
together.; He 
only discovers his mistake once he's met Warren (Anthony Barrile), the 
out-of-work actor who needs the roommate."
32593.0,Snow White,1998.0,"If
you've read Robin McKinley's 'Beauty', 'Rose Daughter' or 'Outlaws of
Sherwood' you realise that a good story can be told again and again in
many different ways.; Sigourney Weaver is outstanding as Claudia.; It captures the essence of
darkness perfectly, but I think it would have been better if it had been
longer.; The media-astute amongst you will recognise ""The Grimm Brothers' Snow 
White"" as the latest in the string of ""X's Y"".; Another
bonus is being able to hear Weaver singing beautiful operatic arias in a
pure voice - I had no idea that she could could sing.","Sam Neil is wasted in a
bombastic, silly role of a weak male figure far too easily manipulated.; This schizophrenic identity is 
indicative of a picture that would like to reinvent an old myth, but 
instead just slaps on a fresh coat of paint and sticks a huge 
extension out the back.; He doesn't contribute much
to the film as a whole except to make it credible that he would become
enslaved by the charms of the evil Claudia.; Nonetheless, Snow White isn't supposed to be a towering spokeswoman for
women's emancipation.; (""Tonight on Oprah - Satan, Master of All Evil or Just 
Misunderstood?"")"
32622.0,Angela,2000.0,"Nevertheless, for those 
who appreciate perceptive, offbeat, experimental features, ANGELA offers 
a rewarding one-hundred minutes.; In 
some ways, ANGELA can be seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of 
taking a particular dogma to an extreme, but, mostly, the movie reminds 
us of the complexity of life from the child's point-of-view, something 
it's easy to forget once we cross the invisible boundary of adulthood.; That's the quality of youth that ANGELA most perfectly 
captures.; The film builds slowly, but inevitably, 
towards a conclusion that is at once powerful, shocking, and moving.; Viewing her nearly-flawless performance, it's easy to understand why 
Miller cast her.","United States, 1996

nothing else, routinely capable of eliciting great performances from his
casts.","The problem is with the script, written by debut screenwriter
Laurence Coriat.; Their stories are almost all
boring, particularly coming on the heels of Paul Thomas Anderson's far
superior film Magnolia.; I dreaded that there would be some hugely

man for whom we are supposed to feel sorry or a hammy actor whose bad 
slapstick is supposed to make us laugh.; And the movie itself, which starts off as by far the worst 
kids' movie of the year, improves only marginally by the canonical big 
ending game.; In short, the story by Anne and 
Robert Vince is completely ridiculous and far from funny.; If Jack is 
such a genius, why did he agree to be in this stinker?; One kid is 
so bored that he knits on the ice."
32911.0,Wide Awake,1995.0,"But regular life must go on,of course, and we have a surprisingly affectionate
portrait of life among the nuns.; WIDE AWAKE contains other solid 
performances as well.; On the contrary they are understanding and even
enjoyed by a bunch of boys who act so unlike some cliques 
in a tough urban school that a cynical city teacher in the
audience would laugh out loud if she were not already
shedding tears over the plight of the sensitive and loving
Joshua.; It's good to see a
heartwarming film so well realized that deals not with the
estrangement between generations but with the natural love
that the old and young can share.; ""Wide Awake,"" unlike other coming-of-age stories, is not
about a kid's fears of not fitting in or not getting a date or of
needing to escape from abusive parents or an intolerable
school.","Maybe the film would have been
better if, instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks, it
were set entirely during Joshua's last year with his grandpa.; It's just too bad that it had nothing relevent
or even truthful to say about death, children in a parochial elementary
school, or for that matter, about God.; With
jumbled messages, and an unclear audience, Wide Awake was better left
asleep.; However, it doesn't work that way at all.; This part of the film was the final straw
for me, I couldn't swallow any more goo."
32924.0,Catchfire,1962.0,"Though, it's entertaining as it
takes us into the modern commercial art world and pretentiously shows what it
takes to be a modern artist, let's us eyeball Jodie Foster in the nude, and has
Dennis Hopper do his usual eccentric character number--this time as a hit man
who wants to be loved and play the sax like Charlie Parker.; But she eludes both the hit man and the cops when located and rents a
unique artist retreat in New Mexico.; He will
then give Anne a choice: I finish you now, or I let you live and you belong to
me.; After two
months undetected, the Mafia hit man hired after the fiasco in Anne's apartment,
Milo, finds her by getting to know everything he can about her and gets her
location when he sees a lipstick ad that is the same as one of her
language-based works of art she does on flashing neon signs.; Soon the two unlikely lovers find a way to relate to each other, as Milo
pines: I gave up a career for you.","The film becomes ridiculous by the time of that unbelievable romance on the run
and by its finale it becomes a hopeless mess.; Since none of it made too much sense, the fun to be found in
this largely improvised flick is to see if you can get some laughs from how
absurd it is.; It ends
with a bunch of silly action scenes involving a helicopter chase and an oil
refinery explosion.; I would have hated to see the film when it
made less sense than it did now.; Since I only got a mild dosage of laughter out of it, I was only
mildly pleased with the flick."
33135.0,Fun,2000.0,"You think
about it and remember it, which is good, very good.; I find it even
more amazing that both turned out to be compelling, exceptional films.; Alicia Witt and Renee Humphrey are absolutely fabulous, and have
characters that are very well constructed and deeper than most female
roles in film.; ""Fun"" makes the girls a part of you, and you don't easily forget them.; Above all, however, FUN gives us a chance to peer into the 
psyches of two memorable characters.","Distributor It's said that the worst thing for a parent is to watch the burial 
of their child.; But what about watching the burial of someone murdered 
by their child?; Half of the film was shot in mock-documentary fashion, on grainy, black
and white Super 16mm.; Hillary frames her prison interviews the way they would exist in a
TV-movie; Bonnie, a habitual liar, persists in reciting a scenario in
which she is one of an army of invisible ninja.; This seems more specifically
pertinent when you remember that Bonnie and Hillary, who are greatly
influenced by movies and television themselves, appear uninterested in
forming any dissociation between their realities and fictions."
33379.0,Greenfingers,2000.0,"Greenfingers is not unlike most comedies imported from Great Britain over
the last few years.; Also highly enjoyable is Helen Mirren; 
although ""Greenfingers"" scarcely taps into the full range of her acting 
talent, Mirren is hilarious as a sort of British Martha Stewart.; Written by Hershman, Greenfingers contains plenty of laughs.; Owen's bedside scenes with Kelly,
who lends the film a human touch, are a marvel to behold, emotionally
gripping without being sappy.; Fortunately, ""Greenfingers"" 
boasts several fine contributions, particularly from Clive Owen, whose 
Colin is sympathetic but nonetheless retains an edge which reminds us that 
he is, all the same, a criminal.","Very disappointing.; I'm not saying
Greenfingers is bad - it's actually quite entertaining - but there just
isn't much to it.; To Hershman's credit, he doesn't pump up
the drama or try for cheap laughs, like last year's lame marijuana
comedy Saving Grace.; Given the
astonishing good looks of Clive Owen, this movie could turn
out to be a chick flick, bringing in the romantic women to
whom it's targeted, but to see Mr. Owen in this after his
spellbinding turn in the far more developed ""Croupier"" is
disheartening.; However, there are some laughs, and David Kelly is of course lovely, as is
Helen Mirren, in a British sort of Martha Stewart persona, and it's worth
seeing, just not worth paying too much."
33430.0,Twin Falls Idaho,1958.0,"Each has a remarkable range of 
emotions, and show true skill.; From there on, a touching
friendship develops as Penny watches out for the boys, even taking them
partying on the one night of the year when their condition is invisible
to the human eye -- Halloween.; Her Penny is 
always believable and  mostly pure.; I was expecting a
more gritty movie, but ""Twin Falls Idaho"" has chosen to keep the
tension subtle.; This 
is very bleak stuff.","Add an ending that lacks closure, and you have a movie 
with an inferior second half that outweighs its superior first half.; TWIN FALLS IDAHO runs way too long at 1:50.; Yes, there is a real town called Twin Falls, Idaho, but it has nothing at
all to do with this film.; The film couldn't free itself from all
the pain entailed in the three characters, and kept making the story
more and more muddled.; Firstly, ""Twin Falls Idaho"" goes for the too cute punning movie title,
sort of along the lines of ""Good Will Hunting"" being side-swiped by a
certain David Lynch TV series."
33452.0,Entangled,1999.0,"He manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic
relationship with beautiful model Anabelle (Laurence
Treill).; In the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the
videoshelves in the early 1990s came this French-Canadian
co-production by Max Fischer.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","All of those
definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone's
precious time.; Low budget also becomes painfully visible, and
physical attributes of Laurence Treill are the only thing
worth watching in this film.; Instead, they would have to settle with
pointless, slow scenes involving Nelson, Brosnan and
Laurence Treill's attempts of serious acting.; Pacing of
the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers, and those
patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a
long time between any interesting or significant
developments.; Unfortunately, this film has
too little of those supposedly erotic scenes, so those who
wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel
disappointed."
33518.0,Alligator,1941.0,"David 
is a lot like a usual film cop: his apartment is small, cluttered, with 
some art posters on the walls, he lives alone, has a cute little puppy 
to keep him company.; Michael 
Gazzo is also on hand as The Chief, who is skeptical at first but 
eventually believes David.; ""Brain Donors"" is comedy that makes me laugh hard everytime I see it, 
though I wouldn't put it on any top-ten list.; Forster fits the role very well and, the most 
important thing, he looks like he is having fun.; Brock is a required character because his 
presence forces David to get fired and hunt the alligator on his own, 
which is what HAS to happen.","The odd thing about ""Alligator"" was that it was not very scary.; Silva is such a bad actor, however, that 
his character is an annoyance in his few scenes before he becomes gator 
food.; The only real distraction in the film is Colonel Brock, a big-game 
hunter, played by Henry Silva.; The script, by John Sayles (!; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

33592.0,White of the Eye,1992.0,"But
in those visual shots... there is a real passion that the director has
shown for filming a ritualistic killing and highlighting the outward
beauty he sees in a woman.; Mike has disappeared from the scene and it is now 10-years later, and
Paul and Joan have a young girl (Danielle Smith), and seem to be madly
in love with each other, though Joan is a wee bit jealous that a rich
movie actress, who happens to be a stunner, Ann Mason (Alberta Watson),
has eyes on her man.; In ""WHITE OF THE EYE "" he shows an artistic eye for odd details that he
catches with his sexy camera, as he heads to the Tuscon, Arizona area
and follows a gruesome, woman hating, serial killer around.; For a film that has such a weak story and fails to be absorbing as a
character study, this is, nevertheless, a well-crafted visual spectacle,
featuring an array of beautifully stylized color co-ordinated scenes and
out-of-the-way shots, that have little to do with the story, but overall
they create a bizarre atmosphere that fits the brooding mood of the film
to a tee.; But with Joan explaining what she did, the
detectives, though still very suspicious of Paul, let him go for the
time being.","As a film about mysticism, it fails
badly to materialize as anything but nonsense.; Her bad hair day will
pale in comparison to what happens to her next, as the unseen psychopath
ritualistically slices her up and leaves on the table an ancient
mystical Indian sign.; This is the second
such ritualistic killing in Arizona within the year, but this time there
is a break in the case, as truck tire tracks are found at the scene and
the police are able to say for sure that there were only 44 sets of
those expensive tires recently sold in the Arizona area and they have
the names of all the owners.; If it is the mystery story itself that you are looking for,
I'm afraid you will be disappointed, as it adds up to nothing much.; The film
opens as an attractive, wealthy housewife leaves Goldwaters Deparment
Store and is followed home by a psychopath."
33633.0,Oleanna,2000.0,"But the tense, very dramatic and literate
exchanges that are found in plays written for the theater rather than
TV or movies, make Oleanna a definite must-see film.; William H. Macy, who originated
the role of the professor on Broadway, has a gift for making Mamet's
words sound as close to natural as they can, and gives a haunting and
haunted performance.; OLEANNA is essentially a study of two characters:  an unnamed
professor (William H. Macy) at an unnamed college, and Carol (Debra
Eisenstadt), one of his students.; The film probes deep into some of the darker facets of
human interaction, and anything with this keen an edge will cause
discomfort.; It is here that the flatness of the acting is brilliant.","Three out of four ""characteristic"" movie-goers are likely
to view this as a bad movie (too slow, too pedantic, too stilted).; The subject of the class isn't even clearly
defined.; She comes as a
supplicant while the professor tries to explain to her the reason for
the low grade.; In this manner the characters miss out on being
real people and instead become didactic homunculi for academic
patriarchy and feminist political correctness.; With a lot of academic sounding words it seems
nothing is said, or even happens."
33644.0,How Stella Got Her Groove Back,1993.0,">From the title alone, it's easy to predict how a film like this will end, 
but getting there is such a pleasure, thanks to fine acting, characters 
you can relate to, and a number of finely spun vignettes.; Everyone should have
fun in life, McMillan says through one of life's funniest
characters, Whoopi Goldberg, and if the greater culture
stands in the way, it's the greater culture that's got to go.; When her initial
surprise gives way to a suspicion that this is going to be the
best vacation of her life, she is faced with a dilemma.; But the best supporting player has to be the island of Jamaica,
which steals every scene it is in with its stunning vistas.; As a light romantic drama, How Stella Got Her Groove Back works
surprisingly well.","The movie, two hours
of sumptuous-looking wish-fulfillment, should appeal greatly to this
audience, provided they're willing to overlook some substantial problems in
the material.; The first example of how badly under written the beginning of Terry
McMillan's script is lies in the title of the film.; Stella and Winston sing a boring chorus of ""should we or
should we not stay together"", and that ultimately lasts for the rest of
the ordeal.; And around half way through the film, I was left open-jawed as
I witnessed a horribly under written first half transform into a
horribly over written second.; Rather
than accept this criticism without a whimper, a more acerbic
Stella might have said, ""If you were more of a mother, maybe
he would not now be looking for one."""
34014.0,Moon Over Parador,1999.0,"Yet even unpruned, this is still a splendidly entertaining
movie-movie.; It is also a
compendium of in-jokes and in-references to current events and older
movies.; It will be as
in many of the other gags, which, back in 1988, were there for older
memories.; It is rich in comic inventions and fresh bits of business.; A Universal release.","You can't get more unrealistic than this.; Sonia Braga is no more than cake-frosting.; Editing, Stuart Pappe.; It's much harder to do than it sounds, or for that matter, than it
looks.; There's a starry-eyed comparison of that movie's finale with Moon's."
34044.0,Waco: The Rules of Engagement,1998.0,"I recommend this
picture to you highly and hope to see it at Academy Award time.; Undoubtedly, but overall
it is a convincing and surprisingly well balanced presentation.; Those like me
who knew, or thought they knew, what happened to those ""crazy"" Branch
Davidians in their confrontation with law officers, will not be able to
watch this film without many second thoughts.; The best films are those you'll never forget and those that cause
you to reexamine your assumptions.; The even-handed and highly acclaimed new documentary, WACO: THE
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, is an astonishing piece of work.","It is not rated but would
be an R for the mature subject matter and a few scenes of charred
bodies.; The filmmakers got a bit too involved
in their material with the result that the film goes on about a half
hour longer than it should.; A government infrared tape shows 2 people
with machine guns shooting from the backyard into the only available
exit.; One of the many members who did not fit the media stereotype of
the religious fanatic, for example, was a middle-aged, black graduate
of Harvard Law School.; A shorter, more focused film would have
had more impact."
34170.0,Larger Than Life,1995.0,"Hilarious.; LARGER THAN LIFE can't hold 
a candle to GHOSTBUSTERS or GROUNDHOG DAY, but it's a lot better than 
duds like CADDYSHACK.; LARGER THAN LIFE doesn't offer anything startlingly new or 
original, although the best gags are worth at least a chuckle.; LARGER THAN LIFE, the comedy that puts Bill Murray on the road with
an elephant (!; His shtick is teaching how to ""Get Over It"" as he got
over his father's early death.","It sucks like an elephant sucks.; Director Howard Franklin's pacing and the plodding
editing by Sidney Levin only serve to compound the problems of the
screenwriter's lack of ideas.; We'll watch names for 87 minutes and
then a very brief two-minute movie, about as long as a trailer is now.; Motivation meets on his cross-country trip to California-- to sell Vera
to either a zoo-keeper (Janeane Garofalo) or an animal trainer (Linda
Fiorentino)-- is particularly funny, not even the manic trucker Tip
played by an unrecognizable Matthew McConaughey.; The
script is the weakest part of the film which is a shame since the
possibilities are endless."
34299.0,Beautiful,1999.0,"As Mona, the talented Minnie Driver (2000's ""Return to Me"") perfectly creates 
this person who is unknowingly a monster on the outside, a side effect of 
never experiencing love and compassion before in her own family.; At the story's outset, it is compelling and funny.; and Kathleen Robertson (1999's 
""Splendor"") are surprisingly memorable, as a poignant twist in the story's 
conclusion exposes both of them as being exactly like Mona, something she 
herself fears.; The two constantly butt heads, and, coupled with Mona's inability to
deal with real life, Ruby essentially becomes a mother to both.; Eisenberg and Driver work well together, and the familial relation between 
the two is believable.","Other than that, a complete and utter waste of time.; Every performance is gratingly awful, and all 
the roles are badly miscast.; It's difficult to say whether the film had a weak, choppy
script, or if Fields insisted on cramming too much into the final
product.; This lack of humanity makes the character fundamentally
boring to watch, in spite of Driver's obvious talent.; PS: Skip this movie!"
34314.0,Turbulence,1995.0,"TURBULENCE works best as a physical and psychological mano-a-mano between
Teri and Weaver, with the 747 turning into a careening Winchester Mystery
House of mysterious passageways.; That is only one of the places
TURBULENCE, a thriller with unique and sometimes compelling rhythms,
misses its chance to be something special.; We've
seen it before in Passenger 57, Executive Decision, and countless other
flicks that are good in there own way.; Through a series of amazing contrivances, the pilot and co-pilot 
end up dead, and, with the 747 plunging into a dangerous storm, Ryan is 
chasing around one of the flight attendants, Teri Halloran (Lauren 
Holly), who eventually holes up in the cockpit to try to land the plane.; He asks her what her favorite movie is (GONE WITH THE WIND), what her 
favorite book is (GONE WITH THE WIND again), how old she was when she 
first had sex (18 1/2), and whether she enjoyed it (yes).","Often with bottom-of-the-barrel cinema, it's possible to make the 
case that a decent premise has been ruined by poor execution.; The story is beyond routine, the
script is
embarrassing (at one point, this jumbo jet is flying completely upside
down), the characters are worthless, and the performances are annoying.; You wasted your time and money.; Then there are ""bad"" films, such as ""Turbulence"" and last year's ""The
Substitute"", starring Tom Berringer.; The script is so bad that I was laughing very loudly at
all the wrong places."
34444.0,Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,1999.0,"If you can actually get past the oddities, though, it's
one of the funniest films you'll ever see, but one that will leave you
wishing that cowgirls didn't have to get the blues.; ""Joan Ellis: the Pauline Kael of the Internet"" -Newsweek
http://movie.mike.com (with search engine) or send any email to:
movie@telecomp.com.; As just about everything Gus Van Sant does is, the film is excellent as a
metaphor movie.; Set to a terrific score by
k.d.; ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues"" is Gus Van Sant's vision of
Tom Robbins' counterculture classic.","Whether this is a result of 
poor editing, confused writing, or (most likely) a combination of the 
two, the result is obvious - a chaotic motion picture that never finds 
its focus and is agonizing to sit through.; In some 
sense, it's hard to believe that this much talent can produce something 
so worthless.; With the notable exception of that given by Thurman, the 
performances are awful.; Even if the plot made sense (which it really doesn't) and wasn't 
unbelievably contrived (which it is), EVEN COWGIRLS is difficult to 
follow because of its disjointed nature.; It didn't work."
34615.0,"Cry, the Beloved Country",1995.0,"This is a subtle but wonderful film that I
recommend to you strongly, and I give it *** 1/2.; It works brilliantly at many levels beyond its portrayal of
apartheid.; A more moving and
powerful performance I have not seen in a long time.; The ending is perfect, and I
think hopeful.; The strange but believable 
bond between the two men is reinforced in the scenes that 
follow.","To make matters worse, this man is
the son of Kumalo's wealthy neighbor, James Jarvis (Richard Harris).; One has
to wonder  why the studio decided to make the investment at all, what
with apartheid in South Africa being dismantled and all.; The movie is rated PG-13 for a little violence, but
there is no sex, nudity or bad language.; A Miramax release.108 minutes.Rated PG-13.; We had an execution, jilted lovers, big-time payback, and at least
three sprawling examinations of someone's life."
34714.0,Diamond Men,2000.0,"Bess Armsrong is perfect as
the love interest for Eddie and gives dimension to her perf as a woman with
a past but, nonetheless, a good woman.; There is a palpable chemistry between Forster and Wahlberg as the two very
different, generationally separated diamond men have to first, tolerate
each other (especially Eddie towards Bobby), then, accept each other and,
eventually and believably, become good friends.; Secondly, he's elicited
strong and natural performances from his two costars, with Forster's 
being one of the best male leads of the year.; Bobby arrives in a flashy sports car ('I can't sit in that seat - my prostrate
will be up in my throat,' harrumphs Eddie) full of bravado.; He resists, at first, the wisdom of
the road dispensed by Eddie but soon learns that the older man knows what
he is doing and it behooves the rookie to pay attention.","Poor Robert Forster.; Supporting cast is scant but character actor George Coe
is convincing as one of Eddie's oldest customers and a close friend who
falls for a much younger woman, to his own detriment.; 1:42 - Not Rated but includes language and brief nudity The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; It's a plot point that has destroyed
other independent films: L.I.E.; He thinks he can just waltz into stores
owned by Eddie's clients and sweet-talk his way into boffo sales."
34870.0,Medea,2000.0,"And even though both Pasolini and
von Trier are gifted filmmakers, with Pasolini, in my opinion, being the
more poetical and imaginative of the two, nevertheless, Dreyer is still
the master, and I would have expected more from him than I do from the
others, though I am pleased to say, I am sated by both these differing
versions of Medea, but in differing ways.; As a result, he
has lost his will to live, and we see him moaning in pain as he takes
his life in the amber fields.; Through her fall from grace, we see the tragedy unfold,
and the deadly consequences of her jealousy and sense of being wronged
come around to its bitter fruition.; And that is what made me become
taken aback by the power of von Trier's camera, the majesty of his amber
and golden and brownish shadings, that is what made the tragedy even
more moving, as he took me into the hearts of the innocent kids this
woman hung from a small tree in order to satisfy her vanity.; Kristen is an accomplished and noted actress, her performance was as
emotionally and intellectually satisfying as the one Dreyer got from his
young unknown actress (Renée Falconetti) in his THE PASSION OF JOAN OF
ARC (1928).","The dialogue is sparse.; He came very close to turning me off, as I was beginning to suspect that
these scenes didn't have to be that explicit in all its morbid details,
the idea of having the older child go back for the younger one, seemed
to me, to be exploitive and incredulous, as well as unnecessary.; The only difference is that from Dreyer's style of
simplicity in filmmaking, we can feel the pains ourself, we didn't need
it enlarged and magnified by wasted and unnecessary movements.; I'm talking about him saying that he communed with
the spirits of Dreyer and those spirits approved of what he is doing to
change the film.; So who cares about his self-promotional schemes that have turned
many people off him."
35113.0,I Want You,1999.0,"It's a slow-moving visual piece, setting a bleak
moody atmosphere as it touches on voyeurism and misplaced love and obsessions
and childhood abuse.; That is when one has time to reflect back on the destructive relationship
and all its implications.; Its best feature comes by way of
Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak, who uses his noted method of filtered
filming to great advantage here to capture the angst of the characters and their
dark love life.; One day Helen lets him make
love to her, but she then reports him to his probation officer as stalking her.; This ill-fated relationship comes to a sudden tragic culmination, which gives
power to all the visual images leading up to this surprising climax.","It mainly holds one's interest because the story is so
oddly told and all the characters seem to have dark sides ready to burst open at
any time.; There are hints that she
was sexually abused as a child by her father.; In
order to relieve his sexual tensions, Martin has exotic strippers do private lap
dances for him, as Costello's 'I Want You' plays.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
35118.0,Diamonds,1997.0,"The two have great chemistry
and their tryst is strangely romantic and satisfying.; Harry, once a boxer 
known as the Polish Prince, fondly remembers his days as the 
welterweight champion of the world.; He's
surprisingly nimble and quick-witted, and he proves that the ""Polish
Prince,"" after all those years, can still kick some butt.; Thanks to
practicing daily with a videotaped speech coach, Harry is now able to
speak somewhat intelligibly.; On the other hand, Lauren Bacall, playing a Reno madam, is
excellent as the love interest of Harry.","The acting in the film is so bad that I actually
believe everyone was purposely horrible to make Douglas look better.; Try Juno for FREE -- then it's just $9.95/month if you act NOW!; But no, there isn't a beanstalk  that
would have made the film entertaining.; They head for Reno, which makes no sense if you've gone to
British Columbia on the way from San Francisco.; But, then again, she's playing a hooker, so I'm not sure you
can even call what she's doing `acting.'"
35796.0,Lawn Dogs,1987.0,"Suffice it
to say that it has just about everything in it, including a director
who knows precisely how to combine the ingredients in amazing and
compelling ways.; John Myhre's interior sets of the homes have cool, pale blues
accented with perky roses and purples.; The performance by young Mischa Barton alone is worth
the price of admission.; The imaginative director of SIRENS
stages scenes in ways shocking, surprising, and generally quite
satisfying.; With rampant sexuality, violent undertones, and
fascinating characters, the film has something for everyone.","The plentiful 
attempts at satirizing the suburban lifestyle consistently strike a 
wrong note, often seeming cruel, uncomfortable, or out-of-synch.; The film expends enough effort on the 
latter to mute the impact of the former, and the climactic sequence is 
an exercise in violent, predictable melodrama.; Worse, 
the supporting characters are all pure caricatures.; In her script for ""Lawn
Dogs,"" directed by John Duigan, all of the adults to
whom we are introduced living in Kentucky's Camelot
Gardens are bad news, while the three working-class types
who live in a mobile home and what could best be described
as an enlarged tin can are salt-of-the-earth good guys.; The picture, whose funding is provided by the Rank Group
(remember the guy who hammers away in slow motion at
the gong in the logo?"
35944.0,Lucky Break,1999.0,"Together, these two generate a palpable 
chemistry -- not surprising, since they're a real-life couple.; Of the 
pair, Carides has the best screen presence, and her portrayal of Sophie 
manages to find the right mix of playfulness and wistful yearning.; Unlike painting and literature, the cinema both gives to life
and takes from it..."" The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; One day at a library, as Sophie is reading aloud while she 
pens an erotic passage, her voice and words captivate Eddie (Anthony 
LaPaglia), a high-stakes jewel dealer who is browsing nearby.; He is so 
taken with Sophie's beauty and charm that he asks her out on the spot, 
but she refuses.","And, 
on at least two occasions, the slapstick, while admittedly funny in a 
sophomoric way, is so overblown that it seems out of place.; Like PULP 
FICTION's Quentin Tarantino, writer/director Ben Lewin is more 
interested in having a little over-the-top fun within the genre than 
blatantly mocking it.; (Why?; In the process, she takes a nasty 
spill and breaks her leg.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

36136.0,Another Day in Paradise,2000.0,"But if anyone makes this movie even somewhat good, it's James Woods, who 
infuses the film with so much energy and vitality that he almost 
single-handedly makes it work by sheer force of will.; And Mel tells him, he can't take his sister's kid into the
organization, (he's the one that brought Mel in to treat Bobbie) because
his sister would kill him for making her son a professional criminal,
and besides, he tells the kid, you're small, you're just right for the
heist job I have planned for a drug clinic, where you hide in a vent.; With his
mesmerizing blend of incendiary emotions and fascinating charisma, Woods
adds a dazzling spark of life to any project he undertakes.; The opening shot of ""Another Day in Paradise"" is especially nice.; He has
     everything planned out.","Bad idea.; Clark's 
opening of weird realism is instead traded in for a cliche-ridden plot, 
and characters who are either one-dimensional or never even bothered 
with.; As Bobbie's girlfriend, Rosie, Natasha Gregson Wagner spends most of the
movie whining and cooing and asking him to get high with her and come to
bed.; James Woods, perhaps Hollywood's best relief pitcher, saves yet another
otherwise mediocre movie in ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE.; This time around, instead of chasing vampires,
he pursues money and jewels and though he says ""sorry""
before shooting one of his victims in the head, he appears to
have been born without the slightest appreciation of guilt."
36196.0,Party Girl,1999.0,"Interspersed with Mary's quest to find her place in
the fascinating world of library science, she frequents party after
party, always in search of the hippest hangout and the ultimate cool
time.; Basically, if you are somewhat familiar with libraries, falafel, the
   Dewey Decimal System, house music, babganoush, or New York City, you
   will probably enjoy this movie.; Her godmother is not pleased, of course, and to repay the loan
Mary takes a job under her godmother at the public library as a clerk
(Mrs. Lindendorf is a full-fledged librarian).; Parker Posey, as Mary, is the driving force behind the movie.; First Look Pictures Releasing
Directed by: Daisy von Scherler Mayer
Cinematography by: Michael Slovis
Written by: Harry Birckmayer, Sheila Gaffney, Daisy von Scherler Mayer
Edited by: Cara Silverman
Starring: Parker Posey, Omar Townsend, Sasha Von Scherler, Guillermo Diaz PARTY GIRL is the kind of movie that brings out the kitschy
adjective thesaurus in me:  It's a swanky flourish of a movie that
grooves its way into your heart.","As a result,
much of the movie's dialogue is stilted and just doesn't flow smoothly
enough to convey the sarcastic wit all of these characters are supposed
to be imbued with.; Without Posey, in fact, the
movie would be downright dull.; Scene to watch for: Mary confronts a
   patron who reshelves a book improperly.; I wish
the filmmakers had taken Mary's own advice here:  ""Lighten up!; The budget has also burdened PARTY GIRL with some
damaging sound problems."
36233.0,Posse,1991.0,"Despite numerous problems, POSSE remains an entertaining film.; Strong
direction, a cast that ""clicks"" and effective use of ""post office
mural"" style cinematography.; From Cuba of 1896 to the U.S.,
Lee's posse moves west as he pursues vengeance against the men who
murdered his father.; In
addition to bringing a refreshingly new perspective to the western, it
tells a solid story.; Initially, baser motives (like cheating at gambling) are the unifying
force, but as the escape progresses the characters trust and know each
other on a deeper level, and the color issue gradually fades.","Some interesting
race-related points are raised, but Van Peebles disappoints by focusing
instead on the standard elements of the picture.; Complications in technique and a busy sound track of mostly
inappropriate music cannot disguise, indeed only emphasize, the
unintelligent mess this movie is.; For one thing, POSSE's writers might have bothered doing a little
research.; All this filmed with various, irrelevant ""effects"" such as a
brown filter that makes it look like he used film stock that was too
old.; But none of the
actors was able to rise much above the mess of the rest of the film."
36321.0,Money Movers,1998.0,"But, despite all those shortcomings,
MONEY MOVERS should be watched as refreshingly entertaining
piece of underrated cinema.; Darcy's
suspicions and some other strange events also bring the
attention of a local crime boss Jack Henderson (Charles
'Bud' Tingwell), who would also like the piece of an action.; The plot is really intriguing, allowing
some interesting twists and surprise, although Beresford
does reveal most of its cards in the beginning.; In any case, the authenticity of the movie is
quite moot point, because writer and director Bruce
Beresford throws nitty-gritty realism to our face.; His worries multiply when he gets
anonymous tip that the firm is going to get hit from the
inside.","Also,
despite the huge amounts of pulp material - sex, violence,
bad language, police corruption (in many ways than one) -
its use doesn't seem to be gratuitous.; Security
firm specialised in the transport of money and other
valuables becomes the target of repeated hits by armed
robbers.; The screenplay is based on the novel by Devon Minchin, yet
the beginning credits tell that the plot was based on the
actual events.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
36354.0,Steele Justice,1992.0,"Twelve years later, general Kwan is a
respected businessman and unofficial leader of Vietnamese
community in Los Angeles.; As this film shows, that sad truth is
universal, and Vietnam War wasn't exception.; A few years ago, my country was embroiled in long and bloody
war, and I had lot of opportunity to see what happens with
the veterans afterwards.; After Lee and his family get
killed by Kwan's henchmen, Steele decides to go to war
against Kwan to avenge his best friend's death.; What
distinguishes this film from the rest of many similar
B-products is huge army of capable actors like Ronny Cox,
Bernie Casey and Joseph Campanella in supporting roles,
together with Sarah Douglas, Sela Ward and Shannon Tweed
that fill the babes quota.","Unfortunately, the main lead,
Martin Kove, looks like caricature of Rambo, same as Soon
Teck-Or looks like a caricature of Fu Manchu.; For many critics STEELE JUSTICE was nothing more than
routine and not very original LETHAL WEAPON rip-off, filled
with all the clichs of 1980s action cinema.; Most obvious example is a sequence when rock
music video, directed by Sela Ward's character, suddenly
turns into gunfight between Steele and Asian assassins, led
by Al Leong, Asian stuntman with long hair who made
reputation by playing cannon fodder in such movies.; Although
writer and director Robert Boris tries to take subject
matter seriously, this movie occasionally slips into camp
territory.; Here we have
Vietnam veteran as a synonym for invincible one-man- army;
businessmen that can't make money in any other way than by
smuggling drugs; killing of partner/significant other as
motive for revenge; and final showdown in a warehouse."
36355.0,Flipper,1999.0,"They produce warm pastel shades that give a surreal and yet nostalgic
look to the sets.; Sandy tells her sincerely, ""Your lucky, a hurricane on your
first visit.""; It is not rated, but would get a G today.; Careful never to
offend anyone and taking absolutely no risks, the show meanders until
is finally put to sleep by a benevolent editor (Warren Adams).; The song during the show proclaims loudly that, ""Flipper
lives in a world full of wonder.""","Well, as outlandish and ridiculous as the remake is, the original
manages to be slightly worse.; There is no sex, nudity, or even mildly offensive language.; I give the
original just barely one *.; Needless to say, the big storm sounds ferocious but its
effects are fairly tame.; The music (Henry Vars) sounds straight out of one of those Disney
Living Desert TV documentaries."
36606.0,Full Tilt Boogie,1996.0,"Unlike the traditional promotional film, we not only hobnob with the
""upper echelon"" stars and director, but Full Tilt Boogie introduces us
to the assistants, the grips, the peons...the people who get things
done.; FULL TILT BOOGIE is a joyous (almost *too* joyous
-- the group cavorting sequence is a bit too happy and sunny) and
often interesting document on the rigours of shooting a film and the
close bonds developed by tight-knit teamwork, and should be of
particular interest to those curious about filmmaking.; FULL TILT BOOGIE, the directorial debut of Sarah Kelly, is a
behind-the-scenes look at the filming of FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, but it
differs from typical ""Making Of Film X"" documentaries in that its
primary focus is the daily activities on a film set, as opposed to
the creative filmmaking process, and consequently a great deal of
screentime is devoted to members of the film crew usually overlooked
in films of these sorts -- the ADs, the caterers, the drivers, the
gaffers, the key grips, the personal assistants, and so on.; Thanks to a new documentary about the making of a
1996 movie, consider it done.; FULL TILT BOOGIE depicts
the FROM DUSK TILL DAWN shoot as remarkably friendly and great fun,
with the only complaints being the generic ones: long hours and bad
food.","By contrast Quentin Tarantino,
whose writing ushered in a new vogue for violence-as-fun,
appears nervous, puffing on a big cigar as if admitting he
lacks George Clooney's charm but is conscious of his
celebrity status with a substantial coterie of fans.; Instead you'll probably observe some production
guys just hanging around chewing the fat and then, maybe if
you're the type who stays on the phone whenever a customer
service tape says ""Your call is very important to us; please
stay on the line,"" your tarrying will be rewarded with seven
minutes of action.; However, there's just not enough here to recommend it to
the general public.; Watching a shoot on location is among the most tiresome
activities in the world.; No vampires."""
36610.0,Wolf,1996.0,"But WOLF is an intelligent and entertaining film, well worth seeing.; WOLF is an excellent movie directed by Mike Nichols.; Excellent cinematography.; Lighthearted, serious, hilarious, and tragic--uplifting.; Combines all the best of
great action and great comedic films.","THE FLINTSTONES
     Too much hype, but not enough originality.; Monster movies are supposed to
frighten the audience; this one fails utterly in that arena.; Plummer plays his usual bad guy, nothing special.; He also makes the irritating mistake of showing Wolfman Will's superhuman
leaps in slow motion where they look totally unbelievable.; I'm also unfunny games."
36647.0,Blade,1999.0,"Amazing.; Blade is well-made and I really enjoyed it.; Opinion:
The visual artistry and choreography of BLADE, highlighted by excellent
color and camerawork, is superb.; Packed to the gills (or should that be fangs) with
crowd-pleasing fight scenes and mindless action, Blade is a pleasant
enough popcorn movie that may not break any new ground, but has a fun
time right where it is.; Visually this is a very striking and polished film.","However, to view these great action sequences, we have to sit through a 
lame plot, boring dialogue and some boring characters.; The Blood God is a disappointment.; However, David Goyer's script seems to be content to leave these themes 
unexplored and Stephen Norrington's heavy-handed direction consists of 
one tedious, overblown fight scene after another.; This is 
completely forgettable stuff.; On the other hand, if you do not like blood, Snipes or action
sequences, skip this dull knife, crack open a couple of cold ones, and
dunk your fat face straight into a pile of nachos, and call it a night."
36657.0,X-Men,1997.0,"X-MEN is not
just a great comic book movie; it's actually a pretty good movie _period_.; That choice not only gives the story an emotional anchor, it gives
plenty of screen time to X-MEN's most intriguing character and easily its
best performance.; Perhaps the best performance of the X-Men 
is Patrick Stewart who is priceless as Professor X, he plays him with such 
agility, such expertese that he gives one of the best performances Ive seen 
this year.; Both performers are effective and suitably cast, and this 
is an especially nice change from Stewart's usual role as Captain Picard in 
the ""Star Trek"" movies.; Being a non-fan, it is with pleasure to report that ""X-Men"" is a good, 
respectable film--not 'great' by any stretch of the imagination--but one of 
the very few comic book adaptations that has been successfully translated to 
the big-screen.","A better screenplay would
have helped too, the entire story seems like a big prelude to nothing.; Of the X-Men, worst of the lot is Storm (Berry), who not only is given
nothing to do, but has an accent that noticeably fades in and out.; Was this a bad film?; Jackman could have done a lot of self-conscious posturing and
overly pensive emoting, thereby crushing any hopes the film might have.; Finally, James Marsden is sorely disappointing as Cyclops, 
although it is difficult to say whether his utter blandness is the fault of 
the actor, or merely because he has the least to do."
36709.0,Map of the Human Heart,1992.0,"In between the film has its nice
touches, the young man making love to the woman atop a weather balloon, and
some other unusual bits which make the film very enjoyable.; It is a nice film, but it is rather sad and brutal on the cross cultured
opinions that most people have about each other.; MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART deals with people's abilities to stay within their
own desire and love.; Russell is impressed with the boy's
curiosity and deeply affected when he discovers that the boy has
tuberculosis.; Overall, MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART is a mixed bag.","None of its
elements works all the time, but neither is it a complete failure.; Capsule review:  This could have been a story about
     racism, it could have been a film with historical scope, it
     could have been a film about courage in wartime or an anti-
     war movie, it might have been about an engaging love triangle
     story, it might have been a study of contrasting cultures,
     but in trying to be all those things this murky film is not
     enough of any of them.; Jason Scott Lee,
perhaps the most consistent of the major participants, exudes very
little charisma in this role.; This British-Australian-
French-Canadian-Japanese co-production is a hodge-podge of too little of too
much.; The acting is as uneven as everything else in the movie."
36759.0,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,1988.0,"PEPPER'S tells the
story of the fictitious band made popular from the song (and album) of the
same name, released in 1967.; But is Billy getting it on with Lucy (Dianne Steinberg)?; Aerosmith is still going
strong, while Frampton is working the fry bin at Hardee's outside of
Pittsburgh.; Other
characters from Beatle songs include Mr. Kite (George Burns), Lucy
(in the sky with diamonds) and Strawberry Fields (I'm serious).; ""Here Goes Our Career"") and ""Lucy in
the Sky With Diamonds"" (a.k.a.","Even worse are the costumes in the movie.; The absolute worst remake in the movie (besides the fifteen
Bee Gee-Frampton numbers) is Steve Martin's version of ""Maxwell's
Silver Hammer,"" a song from the Abbey Road album about a young
man who kills people with a hammer.; Supposedly this is a horrible thing?; The debate over this is really quite futile
when it comes down to it, because all the film really has to offer is a feast
of horrid cover tunes, embarrassing cameo appearances (George Burns?!; ""Guys in Leisure Suits With No
Talent"") are more than painful."
36819.0,Time Bandits,1991.0,"All in all, ""Time Bandits"" is an enjoyable and intelligent film, and a prelude
to later pieces such as ""Brazil"" and ""The Fisher King"" that would distinguish
Gilliam as one of the most talented fantasy directors working in modern cinema.; Gilliam, who got off
the ground career-wise as the animator for Monty Python, puts his visual
sensibilities to good use, creating magnificent alternate worlds that are both
epic and cartoonish at once.; While BRAZIL chillingly showed the
failure of imagination, and THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN its triumph,
TIME BANDITS is more ambiguous: both the fantastic and the mundane in some
way disappoint the story's hero.; It is a fantasy, and like the two later
films, it is also about fantasy--it explores the relationship between
reality and dreams, illusion, escapism.; The outcome, however, is surprising: in its own way it is as disturbing as
the ending of BRAZIL.","Kevin (Craig Warnock),
an adolescent boy, lives a stultifying life with his parents, who are
obsessed with technology and routine, and spend their evenings watching
awful TV shows.; And the episodic plot
suffers from its arbitrariness: the various sequences, while each effective
on its own, do not add up to much because there is no dramatic impetus.; But, according to Randall, they are just ""borrowing"" it.; ""Time Bandits"" succeeds at both romanticizing and pointing out the hazards of
childhood fantasies, then, but it ultimately drags on a little too long.; The finale, however, rescues the movie."
36955.0,True Lies,2000.0,"It's great fun, and the action
and light dusting of humor works well together.; And, lastly, it's still highly recommended.; It has some
of the best and most realistic stunts in a long time.; That's his
angle, and it works perfectly.; TRUE LIES is audacious, tight, and--most of all--great fun.","Sadly this film is just too
long (but not as boring or tedious as Terminator 2) and if it wasn't saved
by the exciting action at the end, this film would be a waste of time.; Even the worst of the Bond
films do not resort to contrivances this absurd.; There's some funny
Schwarzenegger 'acting' as he tries to show anger, but fails miserably.; The editing is too loose, with
far too many minor scenes.; The script in general is pretty juvenile and not terribly intricate considering
the good premise underneath."
37044.0,Wisconsin Death Trip,1953.0,"From 1890 to 1900, an incredible number of
tragedies and crimes struck the little town.; Both
the movie and the book use newspaper accounts of a string of macabre
events along with striking still pictures to tell the mesmerizing story
of a town gone mad.; By the end we begin to suspect some unknown, sinister force
is at work still.; With extensive live
recreations along with judicious use of period photography, the movie
weaves a creepily fascinating mystery.; The pièce de résistance of WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP is Ian Holm's (THE SWEET
HEREAFTER) omnipresent narration, which is taken directly from the
newspaper accounts of the time.","After everyone in the
audience laughs at this ridiculous wives' tale, watch their eyes dart
about the room looking for just such ears.; It is not rated but might be R for
violence and would be fine for teenagers.; The favorite among the lunatics of the period has to be one Mary Sweeney
(Jo Vukelich) who spent her time breaking windows -- lots of windows.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; She is reported to have broken over $50,000 worth."
37094.0,Falling Down,2000.0,"Fortunately, the performances of
Duvall and Douglas give this film greater strength than most movies of
the genre.; It is arguably in this scene when he most touches a
nerve in all of us.; As a counterpoint to Bill, we're given Robert Duvall's Prendergast,
who is in many ways a similar character.; Bill has all the emotional volatility; Prendergast has
stability and sanity.; But his
rebellion takes a more normal, natural course.","His
marriage has gone sour, his career has gone sour, and life just seems to
have picked him to dump on.; Stuck in a traffic jam that goes on forever, his air-conditioning has
gone on the fritz, the kids in the school bus nearby are hanging out
their windows screaming and a pesky fly is driving him crazy.; It is an uneven
and frequently pretentious story that is never as important or dramatic
as it thinks it is.; Joel Schumacher directing from Ebbe Roe Smith's script
has created a villain cut from the same cloth as Bernard Goetz.; While
it's easy to sympathize with punching a loud-mouthed, profane man in
the mouth, shooting someone to death, no matter how despicable they
might be, is another matter."
37135.0,Tarzan,1994.0,"But what makes Tarzan more memorable for me are the quiet, subtle moments.; I was pleasantly surprised:  The music is top-notch.; Tarzan is also more action packed than most Disney films.; Still, this is one great thrill-ride that Disney has constructed.; This is easily one of Disney's best animated films of the decade and
it's one I can't wait to put in my home library...that is, if my VCR
still works in the year 2000.","This seems like in the
worst traditions of ""Gilligan's Island.""; If
Disney didn't set such high standards the potential for disappointment
would be undeniably less.; True to Disney formula, Tarzan is saddled with two wisecracking
sidekicks, an embarrassed sounding Wayne Knight as Tantor The
Anxiety-Ridden Elephant, and in probably the most annoying role in her
career, a screechy, wisecracking Rosie O'Donnell as Terk, a midget ape
with bad hair.; The movie is unoriginal and predictable.; Not only does it omit the redundant showtunes, but the hero doesn't have
a sidekick (what some might perceive as one isn't really a sidekick to
Tarzan; more like a good pal) and the villain has no henchman."
37345.0,Princess Caraboo,1999.0,"A fun and delightful time
at the movies.; It is the kind of film that makes my job
its most rewarding--a hidden gem.; The pacing was
good and the casting of all parts, even the most minor, was well done.; PRINCESS CARABOO is based on a true story from the early 1800s in
rural England.; In one of the film's best
sequences, Princess Caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by
the Prince Regent (a wonderfully foppish turn by comic John Sessions),
and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly
silly native dance.","The turbanned Caraboo speaks an unknown
language, writes in totally unknown pictograms, and has seems to have
fashion tastes molded on some Pacific Island or someplace in Asia.; Phoebe Cates is the Princess who acts like Asian royalty, but
Cates herself just does not look Asian enough to be convincing.; He is worse than one
of the idle rich; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to
distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply
eliminating them, and since the house and money are all from Mrs.
Worrall, he is a bit too close to them for comfort.; Only John Lithgow is a
disappointment, turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts
to verify the Princess's identity.; I avoided this movie many times figuring it was one of those
cutesy films with adults acting like idiots and set in some place like
Baghdad in the 1500s but with sorcerers and evil spirits."
37410.0,Henry Fool,1999.0,"Hartley has crafted a demanding, sometimes funny, sometimes bleak tale
of a houseful of people thrown off-balance by fate's unexpected twists
and turns.; It's a fantastic accomplishment for him and will easily be
oneof the best films of the year.; It's a fantastic
accomplishment for him and will easily be oneof the best films of the year.; It's a fantastic accomplishment for him and will easily be
one of the best films of the year.; Surprisingly its
Hartley's largest, most accessible, and complex film to
date.","It just didn't add up as a work of
drama, it failed to provide a proper tension between plot and character.; Same crappy writing.); But the film is boring at
times and belabors its points, and goes on for too long without seeming
to be moving with a spark of credibility or in any one direction; and,
is at best, an uneven attempt to say something serious (which Hartley
should be applauded for).; Surely, if ""Godzilla"" can hold its targeted
audience for over two hours, ""Henry Fool"" should have no
trouble doing the same for an intelligent constituency.; Rated R.  Running time:
138 minutes."
37517.0,Kiss or Kill,1997.0,"Frances O'Conner and Matt Day, previously seen as friends in Love and Other
Catastrophes, are excellent as the couple on the run.; Both lives equally tragic, they
survive with each other.; Enjoy, people, enjoy.; Rather than stage this examination in a quiet suburban
town, as the independent masterpiece Sex, Lies, and Videotape did, Kiss or
Kill uses the mystery of the murders that surround them to propel the story
along.; KISS OR KILL is a very good piece of filmmaking.","KISS OR KILL is an honest attempt at something different by
writer/director Bill Bennett, but unfortunately his effort is a wacky,
crazed, emotionally confused mess of a film.; Eventually, a 
particularly engaging setup is wasted to serve annoying contrivances.; Frances O'Connor and Matt Day, reunited here from LOVE AND OTHER 
CATASTROPHES, are appealing performers, but there's little that they, or 
anyone else, can do with this script, which, by trying to be too hip and 
kinetic, ends up being simply muddled.; This Australian criminals-on-the-run picture is directed by Bill
Bennett, whose last movie, TWO IF BY SEA, made my worst films list for
1996.; To be sure, Nikki (Frances O'Connor) and Al (Matt Day) are 
attractive, but they spend the film's 90-minute running time inhabiting 
lifeless husks."
37527.0,Dr. Giggles,1998.0,"Holly Marie Combs
(BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, ""Picket Fences"") also does a great job.; The sets that are used are excellent.; Although DR. GIGGLES never once gets quite that intense, the film
works as well as it does because the doctor represents a very real link
between our safe, rational world and a world where we are very much not
in control.; (It, and
much of Cronenberg's other work, remain among the best horror films ever
made.); Witness David Cronenberg's
excellent film DEAD RINGERS, which in a just world would have garnered
Jeremy Irons an Oscar, but in actuality gave everyone who saw it the
creeps and won only grudging praise from the mainstream press.","Cliff De Young (SECRET ADMIRER, RUDE
AWAKENING, SHOCK TREATMENT), I think, gave the weakest performance in
the film.; With the television ads for the former enticing
us back to Camp Crystal Lake with a promised body count well into the
twenties (keeping Jason very busy at nearly one killing every four
minutes), and the print ads for HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME featuring a handy
reference list of the inventive ways in which nearly a dozen naughty
teens will be dispatched during the course of the film, it's no wonder
that the modern horror film nearly died out by the end of the eighties.; Because of this, no real characterization was created for her character
and it was hard to feel one way or another for her.; It almost seemed to be a
parody of modern horror films, but just when I started to get that
feeling, the film reminded me that it wasn't.; On a scale of zero to
five, I give DR. GIGGLES a four."
37532.0,Slam,2000.0,"It has a unique narrative rhythm, and a gritty, uncompromising style.; Documentarian Marc Levin (HBO's ""Bangin' in Little
Rock"") brings his verite style to the story of Ray Joshua (Saul Williams),
a street poet and small-time marijuana dealer in Washington D.C.'s inner
city.; It's scary, strong, street-wise
stuff.; What makes the film seem somewhat foolish and improbable, is the
contrast of how real and menacing the authentic prison scenes looked and
of how artificial the message of non-violence is, when delivered by
those who lived their entire life in violence and are suddenly converted
by one slam poem into changing their ways.; The highlights
of the film come from the strong performance poetry readings by the
actual poets, where their poems are seen as innovative, and have a more
powerful feel to them than the liberal preachiness of the film does.","Although director Marc Levin gets the poetry part right, probably
because his background is in documentaries, the rest of the movie is
pretty thin.; The
movie would have been much better if the slams were more prevalent in
it.); It's an idea movie, one that clearly wants its audience to walk out
pondering its weighty themes rather than humming a theme song or grinning
from ear to ear.; MPAA Rating:  R (profanity, violence, sexual situations)
Running Time:  100 minutes.; In fact, it's not even a
particularly good one."
37598.0,Butch and Sundance: The Early Days,1982.0,"It exists on its own terms.; And the screenplay thankfully avoids the trap of resorting to
Plan B: ""When audience knows lead characters are in no danger, provide
loved ones or long-time friends to kill off in tragic manner.""; ), including the bank
holdup, the gunfight, and, of course, the train robbery.; As the title suggests, the story is little more than a series of
adventures, recounting the meeting of Butch and Sundance and the start
of their friendship/partnership.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","How do you make a sequel to a film in which the two lead
characters have been gunned down in a shootout?; Lester similarly avoids making it nostalgic or
sentimental.; Film, like its predecessor, ends on a freeze-frame -
otherwise it resists any ironical in-jokes pointing to the 1969
production.; The answer, as 20th
Century Fox figured, is to make it a prequel.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

37626.0,St. Ives,,"All in all, those who miss ST. IVES wouldn't miss a
thing, but those who watch it, won't miss hour and half of
their lives afterwards.; A simple exchange gets
complicated with couple of murders, and even more
complicated when St. Ives realises that Procane was actually
one of most successful criminal masterminds of Los Angeles.; John Houseman and Maximillian Schell, on the other hand,
bring some fun playing their characters in very campy,
almost theatrical styles.; Lalo Schiffrin as composer provides
some good atmosphere with his recognisable style.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Bronson didn't
even have many scenes that would capitalise on his charisma
of an action star.; Acting is,
on the other hand, sub-par, with Bronson, and almost
everyone else, sleepwalking through the role.; Good connoisseurs of 1970s cinema would have experiences a
whole lot of deja vus watching ST. IVES.; His lack of chemistry with Jacqueline
Bisset as his alleged romantic interest is almost palpable.; The
directing style of Jack Lee Thompson mimics other, more
successful crime thrillers with the use of shaky camera and
very dark photography."
37749.0,Looking for Mr. Goodbar,1999.0,"What is real and what isn't, this
film often asks, and we can only answer a little bit later on.; The film's real strength is in how it creates a certain kind of world from
a certain kind of perspective.; Although being consumed with it when she first gets her job
towards the beginning, the more sex she has and drugs she takes, the less
interested in it she becomes, and it's obvious that a balancing act between
the two will not be had.; The film was made several years before the AIDS epidemic struck, but that should
not blur the film's message.; Every now and then we see her aforementioned sister, Katherine, who is
always at the opposite end of the poles than Theresa.","Brooks also could have trimmed the film
by about twenty minutes, because it takes much more time than is needed to make
its point.; It's a proposterous situation because the two parts are just too different
from one another to be taken seriously, which is part of why we can't
totally be swayed by its message, at least in this way.; Instead it come off all too
fable-like, and often intends to shock us more than it intends to say
something very meaningful.; Unfortunately as a tale of two lives, it's too ridiculous, and as a
condemnation of promiscuous life styles, it's too preachy and ends all too
conveniently.; Visit ""Charlie Don't Surf!"""
37820.0,Death in Brunswick,1996.0,"Carl is played by the
chameleonic Sam Neill, who has held his own against such major scene
stealers as Meryl Streep (CRY IN THE DARK) and Judy Davis (MY BRILLIANT
CAREER).; The final
resolution of Carl's troubles to me means that he finally joined the
nutsiness around him, that he finally gave up his quiet, desperate
clinging to sanity and normality; in an insane world, only the sane are
crazy.; Ellery Ryan's cinematography is gritty and apt; the
soundtrack sets an engaging mood from the beginning.; I recommend DEATH IN BRUNSWICK to you if you get a chance to see
it.; Carl's mate, a gravedigger
played by John Clarke, and Clarke have to deal with one of Carl's
problems, but the generally drift of Carl's life by now is becoming
rapidly more self-destructive than anyone else can stand.","No rating, includes violence, nudity, graphic
grave-digging scene.; This movie really tests the limits of good taste, but the
first-time director, John Ruane, is too talented to let his movie slide
over the edge.; Try to hold out for matinee prices; this film is too far from the
mainstream to really justify mainstream prices.; And the film does have a tendency to become a procession of increasingly
outlandish incidents in the manner of AFTER HOURS and INTO THE NIGHT.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

37929.0,Fortress,1977.0,"Jake survives many ordeals
and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when
he begins planing the escape.; Jake (Christopher Lambert)
and Karen Brennick (Lori Laughlin) broke that law and are
caught by authorities on the border.; By the time Brennick begins his
escape from Fortress, those situations not only begin to
look predictable, but utterly implausible too.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","The
reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into
whole series of prison movie clichés and situations that are
painfully predictable.; Whether it was because of real lack of talent,
terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the
end result was almost always horrible.; Of course,
film never tried to explain why the country that lacks
resources to support its present population happens to spend
bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with
sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous
members of the society.; After rather intriguing beginning and some interesting
special effects that depict the futuristic settings of
prison, this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity.; The initially interesting plot is
done even more wrong by stereotyped characters, played by
not too interested or talented actors."
37959.0,Go,2000.0,"Funny, shocking and
overall entertaining, Go delivers.; Not too far behind is the August's sharp sense of humor (suffice it to
say, his hilarious dialogue and original comic situations do have snap) and
the sterling ensemble.; Then I read on and found out
that the film starred Katie Holmes, who is one of the most beautiful
young women on television, and Sarah Polley, who should have won an
Oscar for her heartbreaking performance in THE SWEET HEREAFTER(the
best film of 1997).; Due in no small part to its excellent young cast (some of
whom, I had never heard of before).; The dialogue is sharp and
lively, and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep everyone on
their toes.","It's just not worth disappointing people.; To add insult to injury, in honor of the Christmas holidays,
the cashiers are forced to wear ""Yule Save More"" buttons on their
Velveeta-colored aprons.; The movie started out a little
on the slow side (read lame).; I guess you could say I was not in any position to be
let down.; More ambitious moviegoers may be dissappointed with this derivative
frivolous exercise."

when God finally has her full attention, He tells her the reason behind this
personal revelation: He wants Tracy to come up with a slogan to remind people
that He's still out there.; That's putting it even more impressively than it
really is, but at least it's an innocent film that families can enjoy together
without a barrage of mindless vulgar comments.; True, this isn't so recommendable that I urge you to seek it
out, but it is an O.K.; Still suffering from the anguishable 1970's, 1980 isn't all that pleasant to
look at, but nonetheless offers an overly sweet tale of a little girl's
struggle to do what's right.","Fair or not, older films, save it be classics (which
this clearly is not), just don't have the appeal of an even more lame but
fairly recent movie.; Perhaps as a motive to attract a swarm of
movie-goers to the film, OH, GOD!; There are way too many
stops and starts that seem due more to it's time than to unprofessional film-
making.; OH, GOD!; It spawned two sequels, the first of which followed
the original's premise to a great extent - God comes down to Earth to initiate
a spokesperson of sorts, all the while causing an uproar over this person's
highly unbelievable testimony."
38223.0,Harriet the Spy,1999.0,"It is a delight to
see a film about individuality and integrity which never misses
a beat in telling, with humour and depth, a story of an exceptional
girl.; Arising
from this adversity, angry and vengeful at first, the spy who would be,
learns to resolve her differences peacefully - to forgive those who have
hurt her most, her parents and best friends.; The future shines brightly ahead like the
rising sun in the distant horizon.; ""Good friends"", in Golly's words, ""are one of life's blessings.; So our tale of childhood dreams begins, with a girl sheltered beneath
the loving wings of her nanny Ms Golly (Rosie O'Donnell).","To bad the writing shrinks her to another one of the movie's 
concocted characters.; However, this being a movie
intended for kids, she must be taught a lesson and doesn't get to savor
the pleasures of being mean.; Ideally, the movie would be an IT TAKES TWO 
takeoff.; It's just sugar, there's no real flavor in the different 
colors.; Although the idea is based on a good book, it's not 
supposed to be funny."
38251.0,Mediterraneo,1998.0,"MEDITERRANEO is a wonderful film, and I strongly urge you to go see
it.; This is a most entertaining, charming anti-war film that willenchant
you with its simple story and its beautiful photography.; All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable film; even the (obligatory?); I am really glad that I got to go see this
film and I feel that it is worth full ticket price, whatever it is.; MEDITERRANEO I think is the best film that I have seen this year
and ranks as one of my favorite films out of all the films that I have
seen.","It's all pretty aimless and
pointless, and whatever successes are scored in the main body of the
film, the whole affair is weakened by an epilogue that could have been
bittersweet, but instead is merely an exercise in ""where are they now""
and that worst of Italian cinematic weaknesses, sentimentality.; The island is of dubious strategic value, and to the
small troupe of Second World War Italian soldiers (self-described by
the schoolmaster Lieutenant as a bunch of misfits) sent to capture and
hold the island, it appears to be an exercise in futility.; This one is guaranteed to lower your
blood pressure.; Unrated, includes nudity.; And sitting through the movie is like a trip to lotus land for the
audience as well."
38274.0,Seven Girlfriends,1990.0,"The fun picture, which is
happy just to entertain us, gives us more than our money's worth of
laughs.; These surprises make for some of the movie's best humor.; Radiators, light bulbs and dishwashers prove perfectly
acceptable substitutes for a traditional oven.; In
Paul Lazarus's sweet comedy, SEVEN GIRLFRIENDS, Jesse (Timothy Daly)
thinks he has a solution for that problem.; The casting is excellent and other girlfriends include Hannah (Olivia
d'Abo), a bad psychic, Lisa (Jami Gert), a very angry ex-girlfriend and
Martha (Elizabeth Peña), the most changed woman.","It isn't rated but will undoubtedly be an
R for sex, nudity and language.; With so many big budgeted Hollywood films being so bad, it's
nice to see the producers of a modestly budgeted picture trying to rock
the boat by distributing the film themselves outside of the studio
system.; Her funeral provides the equivalent of the movie's
big game conclusion.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

38295.0,She's So Lovely,2000.0,"He invests great detail into Eddie, creating a 
damaged man who is both simple-minded and remarkably complex.; I also
thought that Gandolfini did an excellent job in his brief appearance on
screen.; Thanks to the wonderful performances from Penn, Wright 
Penn and Travolta, it's a memorable one as well.; And despite all the grit and ugliness, ""She's So Lovely"" is a pure and 
simple love story.; SHE'S SO LOVELY isn't a flawless 
production, but it's a fitting tribute to John Cassavetes, and a 
reminder of the many ways that a woman can be under the influence.","Unfortunately for all involved with this picture, the second half of
the film turns into a completely unrealistic and outrageous scenario,
in which we are meant to understand things which simply do not make any
sense, and given very little support by way of the script by
Cassavetes.; When he tries to forge his own path in the film's second half, the
result is an incomprehensible mess.; In other words, the story just
wasn't there, it didn't seem to be original, and this from a script by
the real McCoy of indie films, is astonishing, to say the least, even
the ending of the film feels like a blatant rip off of  THE GRADUATE.; Admittedly, perhaps the success of the first half, left me with a
greater disappointment with the latter half, but either way, I would
say that the ending of this movie does rate as highly unbelievable and
unsubstantiated.; When Nick tries to remain true to
his father's spirit in the film's first half, the result is strained and
dated."
38509.0,Polish Wedding,1995.0,"The
townspeople are simple, hardworking ethnics.; That said, ""A Polish Wedding"" does have good ensemble
performances by some talented, quirky actors, with Gabriel
Byrne in the role of the laid-back baker who is aware of his
wife's nocturnal goings-on and simply sighs with resignation
and despondency;  Lena Olin as the sexy mom who meets
her lover in full military uniform, pretending frequent a meeting
of the Polish Ladies' Auxiliary; and Clair Danes as the
teenager, her mother's daughter, who climbs through windows
to meet her boyfriend like Alice progressing through the
looking glass in search of magic.; The story revolves
around the boisterous, working-class, immigrant Pzoniak family in
Detroit who are devoted to pickles, pierogi, the polka, and the
American dream.; She sets up a flirtatious romance between young
Chala (Claire Danes) and a young cop who gets her
pregnant, Russell (Adam Trese), and as in most romantic
movies puts enough obstacles in their path to delay the
inevitable Polish wedding of the title.; Yet this is not the tale of a
dysfunctional family but of one which has resigned itself to a
life of brief, joyful assignations only to recognize by the final
curtain that Dan Quayle may have been right.","And then there's some atrocious dialogue, which I am
sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound: ""Look at all these
pickles.; There must have been a reason why neophyte
director/writer Theresa Connelly made this film into a nostalgia story
that wants to look like it was made in the 1950s, I just wish she
included that reason as part of the storytelling and dropped all those
clichés to explain every situation.; I'm sure there could have been some comedy
over this, but the film was so flat, it couldn't draw out the comedy or
any worthwhile observation about this zany situation.; The unrealistic
plot in this basically plotless film, is about how the family rallies
around her condition and the middle-aged matriarch marches her sons over
to Russell's house to force him to marry Hala.; Whenever there's a dramatic crisis withinthe family, Connelly
goes for inappropriate slapstick farce."
38523.0,Ponette,2001.0,"Not a perfect show, but a wonderfully revealing one.; Some of the most memorable moments in PONETTE 
center around the innocent conversations of children -- how Catholics 
are different from Jews, what it means to be ""single"", and how eating a 
certain candy can make you fall in love forever.; ------------------------------------------------------------- It is certain that the lion's share of attention that Jacques
Doillon's film, PONETTE, has drawn is due to the acclaim heaped upon
the performance by the film's lead, Victoire Thivisol, who grabbed
headlines and turned heads when she was awarded the Best Actress
prize in a unanimous decision in September 1996 at the prestiguous
Venice Film Festival.; I highly recommend
the picture to you and give it *** 1/2.; PONETTE works in large part because of its simplicity and realism.","This material seemed to be overextended for a
feature-length film, even one that has a relatively short running
time of 92 minutes, and could have been much more powerful had it
been trimmed down significantly.; It's
too obvious and too pedantic a resolution to a film which is built around
the absence of easy answers.; Doillon's insights are so honest for so long that his conclusion,
involving a supernatural visitation, comes as a real disappointment.; The plot is minimal -- just enough to give us a reason to stay with the 
tiny protagonist for ninety minutes.; I would then
refuse to let the individual walk away until I explained that PONETTE
isn't really ""about"" a grieving little girl, that it's not the maudlin
drama full of teary-eyed waifs that such a hopelessly under-descriptive
synopsis might portend."

money than get honest work himself.","The problem is that the car wreck of a script churned
out by Warren Leight and Ed Kaplan includes so many minor characters and
superfluous side plots that DEAR GOD becomes thoroughly incoherent.; Garry Marshall,

is as electrifying as it is frightening.; Toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes
that are lightweight and funny.; This change in lifestyle means that Rich
has to deal with white people for the first time in his business life.; Though her
character is a typically beautiful, cunning, female fatale (whose motives still
remain unclear to me) Schiffer plays her with such a cold, detached ideation
that she transcends the Sharon Stone-esque similarities and becomes a rather
potent and chilling force.; Intersecting with everything is Rich Bower (Power), who is finally starting 
to edge away from his criminal lifestyle and into the world of being a 
recording artist.","But it's
just not that interesting.; Instead Toback fished out a mediocre one.; But by the looks of this mess, maybe I should've extended my protest

to (unintentionally) laughably attempt to paint Rich and his crew as 
mobster-lite thugs, and by inexplicably casting ""names"" such as Brooke 
Shields, Ben Stiller, and Claudia Schiffer, in roles that were downright 
painful to watch.; Shields was good in THE BACHELOR as a high-society

seeing *Mrs. Dalloway* is a worthy endeavour nonetheless.; Nearby and yet so far away is Septimus Smith who fought in the
Great War and saw a close friend blown to pieces by a land mine.; Now he is coming out of the initial shock and the meaning
of what he has seen is haunting him.; In her
novel, which was first published in 1925 and which deals with
the period immediately following World War I in England,
Woolf creates a 52-year-old woman, the title figure, who
seems to plunge into late-mid-life straits one morning and to
reconcile herself to her plight by the evening.; Thoughtful, yet funny.","Smack dab in the
middle of this frighteningly boring story.; There was her suitor Peter (Alan Cox), and Sally
(another suitor of sorts), and finally, the stuffy, boring, dull Richard
Dalloway (Robert Portal).; There's probably a point to be made, but the film lacks
the confidence to make it.; I rented ""Mrs. Dalloway"" basically because I thought it might be 
interesting, since it is set during a 24-hour period, but what I didn't 
count on was for it to be constantly distracting.; Having never
read the book, I cannot be sure if the problem stems from the book,
Marleen Gorris's direction or Eileen Atkins's adaptation."
38921.0,Burglar,1998.0,"And she
does go into Whoopi Goldberg schticks on occasion--but many of them fit into
the character of the burglar, so it works (I especially liked the Italian game
show host, as she examines the dentist's husband's closet).; Whoopi Goldberg is perfectly
cast as a cat burglar whose masculine behavior challenges traditional
sex-role stereotypes.; Goldthwait's performance is
more restrained than usual, making BURGLAR his best work to date.; Comedian Bob ""Bobcat"" Goldthwait almost steals the movie with his
hilarious performance.; Throughout it, Whoopi Goldberg plays Bernie Rhodenbarr into an
interesting, level-headed character; actually more appealing than the burglar
in the books, in my mind.","BURGLAR, as a whole, is boring, confusing, incoherent, and not
particularly funny.; BURGLAR, on
the other hand, fails to do so and consequently suffers from a lack of
direction.; Unfortunately, these amusing performances are BURGLAR's only merit.; On one hand, it seems to be trying to do
a fairly accurate adaptation of the film (despite the sex changes et al); and
then suddenly it goes for a car chase or some action sequences which really
don't work with the rest of the movie.; The movie's plot is uninspired and muddled, leaving the viewer confused
and ignorant of the mystery's solution."
38985.0,Sorcerer,1997.0,"It was released in 1978 and is a great film
for everyone to see, but it is a can't miss for Friedkin fans.; All of this is set to a mesmerizing and eerie Tangerine Dream score
that is well worth seeking out.; ""Sorcerer"" is an extremely tense and
dramatic film that should keep you on the
edge of your seat.; It's
not a movie you feel like celebrating life with, but it stays with you long
after it vanishes from your eyes.; The sound of
the trucks are constant, and it is a well crafted soundtrack mix that
lends to the character each.","What is the worst movie title in film history?; Not because the
title itself is awful, but because it has virtually
nothing do with the film.; They need someone who can drive four cases of *sweating* dynamite (which
could explode for no reason at all) across 218 miles of jungle.; We see them being reconstructed from complete junk
early on in the film.; He hardly gets to smile the entire
film, and spends most of it struggling to get
the dynamite-laden truck across rickety bridges
and nearly-impassable roads."
38987.0,Possible Worlds,1994.0,"And while there is a wonderfully 
ethereal aura pervading ""Possible Worlds"", Lepage is unable to find a 
balance in this.; What is the nature of George's possible worlds, and how do 
these relate to his apparent murder?; As the only 
constant in each of the ""worlds"", George should be a strong focal 
character, an anchor for the audience.; Copyright © 2001 Shannon Patrick Sullivan.; Meanwhile, George apparently lives 
on in a number of ""possible worlds"", where George is the same man but 
others are vastly different, including his perpetual lover, Joyce 
(Swinton).","Unfortunately, he is a virtual 
spectre, gliding through the movie with little trace of personality.; Profound questions are 
raised, but are sadly tangled in a weak, unsatisfying story.; Attempts to spice things up by injecting comical scenes with 
the police officers are failures too, because the contrast is too jarring, 
and the humour feeble.; But each Joyce is so prickly and 
abrasive that it is difficult to relate to her; consequently, the audience 
is left without anyone to care for.; Review: ""Possible Worlds"" is an interesting but ultimately unsuccessful 
exploration of the concept of ""parallel universes""."
39177.0,Artemisia,2000.0,"This is an excellent movie, although it will not appeal to everyone.; Cervi's portrayal is stunning, 
giving us another young international actress who is as talented as she 
is beautiful.; Today, Artemisia's 
surviving canvasses are recognized throughout the West, and several of 
them reside in the Louvre.; The film is beautiful to watch.; Tassi is presented as a volatile man who loves his 
student as much as his craft.","But in the
year 1610, the idea that a 17-year-old woman would have an
interest in drawing the nude male body or would cavort with a
man not her husband was anathema; positively sinful.; Indeed, the biggest disappointment in ""Artemisia"" comes at the end, when a
rolling title tells us that after the trial ended Artemisia went on to
marry, have a daughter and study in Rome (possibly disguised as a man,
according to some sources).; The movie spends most of the time drifting along aimlessly.; (Nope, that
one's too skinny.; Breasts are too large on that one."
39233.0,Once Around,1998.0,"A movie that makes you think about relationships,
     love, life, death, family change, and just about every other
     human emotion.; A strong theme throughout this movie (more strongly in the
beginning than in the end) is that you can never return home.; Overall I enjoyed the movie, and I would
probably see it again.; The action between Joe and Sam is what makes this movie funny.; Hallstrom has a good eye for the small dramatic incidents of life and
also the daily ironies.","The movie did seem to drag on for a while in the middle, probably
because of lack of a plot.; He simply does not fit it.; She is the main
character and she could have really used an accent coach.; He upstages family members with
extravangances and he overpowers family events with the subtlety of sales
pep rallies.; She's looking for a
career and her longtime lover fails to commit to her."
39437.0,Beloved,1997.0,"Rachel Portman's uplifting score adds to the tenor of the film as does Tak
Fujimoto's brilliant cinematography.; He squeezes strong
performances from all of his cast, notably Oprah Winfrey and Danny
Glover.; 1873 Cincinnati is beautifully realized, and a carnival scene is both 
charming and wonderfully detailed, but most of the film takes place in 
Sethe's dilapidated home.; A well-constructed and deeply honest
film, BELOVED is easily one of the best of the year.; Newton is superb, and delivers an emotionally and physically demanding
performance as the childlike Beloved.","BELOVED is a three-hour long movie
which lacks anything substantial to power it through such an unlikely
length.; Ants crawling on a young woman?; I asked myself, ""Do I really need to
sit through the remaining two hours of this film?""; Where Beloved
fails is sustaining power in its imagery; for all the disturbing images
evoked, the script doesn't have the power to back them up.; There isn't much of a plot per se in BELOVED."
39473.0,Silent Fall,1995.0,"Dreyfuss is good in SILENT FALL and except for LET IT RIDE and
ALWAYS, I have found his work superb.; Faulkner is
equally great as a walking enigma.; Moreover, there is
something hidden in Jack's past, and the doctor seems to be hiding
something himself as does the sheriff.; For every TENDER MERCIES, DRIVING MISS
DAISY, or RICH IN LOVE, there has been a KING DAVID, HER ALIBI, or A
GOOD MAN IN AFRICA.; I will never forget his
DRIVING MISS DAISY, CRIMES OF THE HEART, TENDER MERCIES, or one of my
personal favorites of his, BLACK ROBE.","In SILENT FALL,
director Bruce Beresford has Dreyfuss wandering around in a daze of
what is supposed to be self-pity, but instead looks mostly like a
particularly bad Hamlet.; I can't
emphasize how poorly arrived at the resolution is, how plotted the
whole film feels, and how unpleasant it is to sit through this tripe.; And if there is
anything more unintentionally amusing than watching a ham act, it is
watching him try desperately *not* to be a ham.; Autism, like the rest of the movie's conceits
with psychology, are just cheap hooks onto which to hang the rest of the
plot.; Lithgow overacts as is his propensity unless carefully
directed."
39780.0,Oscar and Lucinda,1990.0,"This is good.; The two play cards with more passion than most
people feel when they make love.; Ralph Fiennes, who normally plays strong, confident men, is very 
much at home as the fumbling, insecure Oscar.; ""O & L"" can be stunning with pictorials more than with its human psyches.; Yet, despite these quibbles, I enjoyed OSCAR AND LUCINDA.","Rated R.  Running Time: 131 minutes.; They are certainly
interesting to watch, as are the inviting images by LITTLE WOMEN's
cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson, but they have no depth.; I was
amused by someone calling it ""hydrophobia,"" which evokes rabid dogs, bared
fangs and awful drool, whereas poor Oscar is the soul of gentleness!; Ralph Fiennes is completely out of typecast here, looking less than
handsome as the nervous jittery Oscar, with his scarecrow appearance and
lack of haircut.; Quirkiness can carry a
picture just so far, and at two and a quarter hours, the movie begins
to wear out its welcome long before the ending credits roll."
39875.0,Popcorn,1979.0,"-- and in it's own strange way,
CHILD'S PLAY still stands as one of the best slash-and-trash parodies
ever made (in addition to being a great horror film in its own right).; POPCORN is a very entertaining horror film that doesn't contain
much gore.; Although this is the first horror film (parody or not) to be released in
a couple of months, it's no longer the only one out there, as THE
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS will be in general release in a matter of days.; While being chilling, POPCORN is also funny but not in a way that takes
away from the film.; Not
to let this get in their way, the students decide to raise the money on
their own.","This put things in a different light, though sadly not
in a more favorable one, for it turns out that POPCORN spends most of
its time attempting unsuccessfully to parody the worst cliches from some
of the worst of the early-eighties slash-and-trash horror films.; Regardless, it
winds up as an abject failure of a horror film, and a big disappointment
of a horror film parody.; Instead, they must have intended the film *itself*
to be a spoof.; Instead, it's a parody done with the
straightest of faces, one that fritters away its entire first half
setting up a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET-like plot just to discard it and
head for the ridiculous in the last third of the film.; The plot -- such as it is -- is held together with what turns out
to be yet another spoof, though alas not a very successful one."
39934.0,Longtime Companion,1964.0,"The film is the fictional story of a
small circle of friends and changes in their world beginning from that fateful
day in 1981 when the first New York Times article noted the outbreak of a 'rare
cancer' in the gay community, known today as AIDS.""; But at a reported $1.5 million in production cost and with a
timely subject, this film is probably a very good choice for a theatrical
release.; It is a true-to-life, unsparing chronicle of a
generation of gay men.; It does an outstanding
job of portraying what has happened in the lives of many gay white men in the
last decade -- those of us who ""grew up"" (metaphorically speaking) in the wild,
exhilarating 70s only to crash into AIDS in the 80s.; The behaviors we see are very much
universal to epidemics and plagues.","LONGTIME COMPANION has too many major characters to keep them all
straight (no pun intended), particularly because they all look like
wholesome, male WASPs, but the center of the group is David, played by Bruce
Davison.; There's a lot there: Gay Men's Health Crisis, ACT UP,
Louise Hay, hospitals, home care, friendship, love, anger, despair, and the
full panoply of awful AIDS acronyms -- PCP, KS, Toxo, CMV, HIV, ....; Also, there are about ten dated sequences and all but the
last four take place on Fridays.; I
believe they are alluding to Hurt's performance in the 1985 KISS OF THE
SPIDER WOMAN.; There is a
reference in the 1982 sequence to William Hurt playing a gay character."
39964.0,Lost & Found,1994.0,"He plays Dylan
Ramsey, the sweet main character, to the best of his abilities.; The untimely death of Farley and the fact that Spade is just a
very funny guy, finally earned him a starring role, and it's a doozie.; The two
bond...but what will happen when Lila discovers the truth?; His restaurant partner and best bud tells
him, ""We thought you were kind of a jerk, until we got to know you.""; At first
look, you don't expect much, the second look is with narrowed eyes as you
contemplate other options for the night, but Spade's low-key humor and
resiliently idling charm eventually quietly worm into your heart.","I choose to look
at this as a sign of a bright future for a talented comedian, rather than a
complete waste.; Mostly you feel sorry for her for getting stuck in such a bad movie.; But detract point since, aside from this, there 
are long stretches that were so dull and unfunny that I was almost bored 
to tears.; Too bad this whole 
dog subplot is lifted directly from the aforementioned ""There's 
Something About Mary,"" and even the dogs look alike.; It's not that the film doesn't try to be funny...it's just that it tries
in all the wrong ways."
39968.0,Western,1970.0,"This is a picture for those
who are willing to simply kick back and enjoy the ride, regardless of where
it takes them.; She's an antiques dealer Paco met shortly after his
car was stolen -- by Nino -- and, in her attempts to help him out afterward,
the two fell madly in love.; So Paco, now unemployed because of the lost car, decides to savor his
freedom, taking Nino along for company.; Taking advantage of
this regional brand of hospitality is Paco (Sergi Lopez), a shoe salesman of
Spanish descent who, through an odd series of circumstances, embarks on a
tour of Brittany with Russian-born Nino (Sacha Bourdo), a hitchhiker/car
thief who greatly envies the suave Paco's skill with the ladies.; Like the heroes of his shaggy, leisurely
comedy, Poirier is content to take the trials of life lightly and, whenever
possible, to simply walk away from them altogether.","With no real itinerary or goal, the
two spend their days scheming to meet women and their nights trying to sleep
with whomever they've met.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

40001.0,Mrs. Winterbourne,1997.0,"The slight momentary movements were so
graceful, so delightful, so filled with Class.; Miguel Sandoval is a delight as the Winterbourne servant Paco.; This mistaken identity bit is a
kind of romantic comedy .; Although Bill claims to hate Connie, how do you
think their relationship will turn out?; In a panic, she calls for the nurse and ""her"" baby is
brought to her, safe and sound.","Unlike MRS. WINTERBOURNE, 
neither of those films is mired in mediocrity.; However, while 
SLEEPING boasted the talents of a charismatic Sandra Bullock and affable 
Bill Pullman, MRS. WINTERBOURNE has an irritating Ricki Lake and bland 
Brendan Fraser.; Actually, the biggest problem with the show is not its
predictability nor its believability, both of which are substantial,
but the lack of energy.; Most
of the film is a failed attempt at comedy, but the lines the actors are
given are so ineffectual that it is hopeless.; I tried to like this show, but there is so
little there that it was not possible for me."
40028.0,Not of This Earth,2000.0,"Well I'll be damned, what a most excellent surprise.; York is by turns hilarious, menacing and tragic.; This is
a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance I've seen from
him.; It seems criminal that the film was released direct to
video in most countries, because it's an absolute must-see for sci-fi
fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written
thrillers with a kooky bent.; The casting is spot on, the acting is terrific and the
script is intelligent, witty and consistently engaging, cleverly
updating the original.","Once again, B-movie king Roger Corman is behind this effort (he
directed the original) but this time he appears only in the role of
executive producer.; Tighter direction could have given the climax more
urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their
life-threatening situation.; British actor Michael York has appeared in
some real stinkers in past few decades, a far cry from the quality
fare of his younger days such as CABERAT (1972).; I must admit, my first glimpse of the video cover for NOT OF THIS
EARTH was not encouraging.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
40476.0,Kadosh,1999.0,"Gitai by closing in on the daily
rituals, tight living quarters and close-knit community, has shown how
difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world
and have been kept in the dark all their life.; The Hasidic community then delivered their votes
to the ""law-and-order"" candidate Rudy Giuliani who has done everything
possible to intimidate the black community, just the way that the
current Labor government in Israel is using every means at its
disposal to intimidate Arabs.; The force of what is seen, though filmed in an
objective manner, never taking a cheap shot at the Hasidim, is
nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a
practice of strict observance.; The unique racial
politics of worldwide Jewry will be forced to define itself in terms
of how these various groups relate to worldwide capitalism and the
oppressed Arab and Palestinian peoples.; She has a long time romantic
relationship with a fellow Hasidic Yaakov.","From the
standpoint of Gitai, a left-wing Jew whose grandparents came to
Palestine in the early part of the century as Labor Zionists, their
orthodox cousins are an uncomfortable reminder of where they came
from.; The prayers are
conducted while he wraps the leather thongs of the 'tfilin' around his
arm, which altogether gives the appearance of a junky preparing for a
fix.; He even thanks God
that he didn't make him a woman.; KADOSH (director/writer: Amos Gitai; screenwriter: Eliette Abecassis;
cinematographer: Renato Berta; editors: Monica Coleman/Kobi Netanel;
cast: Yael Abecassis (Rivka), Yoram Hattab (Meir), Meital Barda (Malka),
Sami Hori (Yaakov), Lea Koenig (Elisheva), Uri Ran-Klausner (Yossef),
Yussef Abu Warda (Rav Shimon); Runtime: 116; 1999-Israel/Fr.); He first reads a prayer that is
supposed to heighten the chances of procreation and then coldly
instructs Malka to spread her legs."
40727.0,Permanent Vacation,1999.0,"The funniest scene, is when he robs a car from a ditzy girl who goes to mail a
letter and leaves the key in the ignition.; It's set on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan, with its abandoned buildings and shabby tenements, which gives it the
look of a war-torn city.; He brings the car to a fence who
gives him $800 for it, and uses the money to hop on a boat and leave NYC.; He tells her his hero is Charlie
Parker, whose motto was: Live fast and die young.; PERMANENT VACATION (director/writer/editor: Jim Jarmusch; cinematographers:
James A. Lebavitz/Tom Di Cillo; cast: Leila Gastil (Leila), Chris Parker
(Allie), John Lurie (Sax Player), Richard Boes (War veteran), Jane Fire (Nurse),
Eric Mitchell (Car fence), Maria Duval, (Latin girl), Susanne Fletcher (Latin
girl), Lisa Rosen (Popcorn girl); Runtime: 65; Cinesthesia/Gray City; 1980) Filmed in 16mm just after Jim Jarmusch left film school, it's a rambling,
visually gripping dream piece, that plays like an odyssey of urban despair,
about a street person named Allie Parker (Chris Parker) and his growing
isolation as a member of the lost post-punk generation.","If it's a girl, they put snow in her mouth and slay her.; On the street, John
Lurie (a member of the Lounge Lizards and along with the director, is the
musical arranger for the film) plays a mean sax solo.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
40820.0,Punchline,1998.0,"Hanks shows incredible dramatic range in a deeply textured
performance.; Despite these character flaws, or perhaps
because of them, Steve is a great comic; he uses his personal bitterness
and anger to fuel his comedy.; Seltzer always captures just
the right balance with his delicate and deft manipulation of the movie's
tone.; Even if you don't like the cast or the subject matter, PUNCHLINE is
a must see simply for Tom Hanks' parody of the Gene Kelly ""Singing in the
Rain"" dance number.; From his displays of rage and anger to his
quiet moments of pain and suffering, Hanks is enthralling throughout
PUNCHLINE.","For instance,
after returning home from watching Steve perform at the hospital, Lilah
frantically tries to get dressed and prepare a dinner for company in 5
minutes flat.; And a scene in which
Hanks bombs on stage because of an emotional crisis doesn't ring true.; The movie opens with her buying jokes, as covertly
as if buying drugs.; In some ways, comedian Steve
Gold is, believe it or not, even more immature than the 12-year-old Hanks
played in BIG.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
40913.0,Dance with a Stranger,1995.0,"Ian Holm and Rupert Everett give competent performances as the men in her
life.; ""Dance With A Stranger"" tells the story of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to
be hanged in England.; The rest of the film follows Ruth and her relationships with
Everett and Holm.; In
fact, we don't see her crime until the last two minutes of the film, with
the remainder of her story told to us through cards at the very end of the
movie.; You'd think with such an interesting story like
that, you'd have a rich and exciting movie.","I don't know if I can stress this enough, but ""Dance With A Stranger"" is a
BAD BAD BAD BAD movie.; She is simply terrible in this
movie.; I had to sit through another 100 minutes of watching her
""bitch and moan""!; I had no
sympathy for her, and I was actually hoping that the filmmakers would at
least show her being hanged.; It is probably the worst film I've seen
since ""Gummo"", and, at the time, I figured it would be years before I saw
another movie at that level of ""badness""."
40948.0,Lie Down with Dogs,1952.0,"JEFFREY, with its sly, sardonic wit and wonderfully
droll performance by Patrick Stewart, is a joy to watch.; The two are as different in quality as they are
in humor level.; - James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; The sole message is '70ish in nature:
life is short, so enjoy yourself.; Leaving the big city of New York behind, Tommie casts his worries
aside, whips out a few credit cards, and, badda-bing, it's party time.","At worst, it's a waste of time.; The end result is 80 minutes of film
that seem like 160--with no socially redeeming value whatsoever.; Tommie embarks on what starts out as a promising voyage of self-
discovery, but after about five minutes, the film sadly degenerates into an
over-the-top quest for nonstop, meaningless sex.; There's no story to speak of and no
significant character development---anything, in fact.; This chorus is
the unifying theme of Wally White's new feature, LIE DOWN WITH DOGS, a
disappointing film about the letting go of guilt and, basically, the
embracing of promiscuity and shallowness."
41003.0,White Palace,1998.0,"I'm glad you asked.; Susan Sarandon sports a truly
unusual hick accent that I never heard once while I lived in St. Louis,
and I lived there 17 years.; Especially the last
scene, which cleverly puts a nice taste in your mouth right as you're
ready to leave the theatre.; Once there, he argues with Nora the
Waitress (Susan Sarandon) and finally gets his $3.00 or so back.; Most of the time, though,
you'll feel more out of place in this film than in a David Lynch movie.","It's not a total loss, just a big
disappointment.; Well, this is just a guess, but let's assume that all
yuppies are shallow and don't know how to have fun.; The story is some sort of weird variant of Cinderella, done worse
than most writers could manage.; Repressed and Ms. Waitress aren't real characters, they're grocery
lists of stereotypical traits.; The director wanted Sarandon to look and sound cheap."
41010.0,Wide Sargasso Sea,1999.0,"He turns the beauty of
Jamaica into a moody, dangerous haunt and peoples it with ciphers whose
actions we cannot begin to understand, unless we ourselves just happen
to be characters in a bodice-ripper.; WIDE SARGASSO SEA, faithful to the novel from which its story is
taken, is a beautifully photographed, wonderfully sensual, and
poorly-paced motion picture.; Music is by Stewart Copeland.; WIDE SARGASSO SEA is has a strong beginning.; His sweltering 1840s Jamaica is perfectly
rendered as the backdrop for the tumultuous relationship between
Antoinette and Rochester.","As a romance, this movie is mildly successful.; There are a lot of sex scenes in this film, but nothing to earn it
an NC-17.; Even with its uneven tone, WIDE SARGASSO SEA might have been a
success had stronger performers been hired in the leading roles.; Probably not that good of an idea to be begin with.; With the characters not being realized with full power, the
storyline becomes plodding, and the movie threatens to grind to a
halt."
41240.0,Bastard Out of Carolina,1995.0,"Of the
supporting cast, special note must be made of the criminally
underrated Michael Rooker's performance.; While set several decades ago, this story remains completely relevant
in today's society, where abused wives return to their husbands, and
abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked
by the other.; Huston's talent with camera positioning is wonderful,
from a visually striking shot done through a fan, to an extended
sequence in the front seat of an automobile.; The film tells the story of Ruth Anne Boatwright, nicknamed Bone by
one of her uncles at birth, in post-World War II South Carolina.; Her work is
of award-calibre, and in this age in which a preponderence of
superb child performers have emerged (Kirsten Dunst, Tina Majorino,
Anna Paquin, Natalie Portman, Christina Ricci, Elijah Wood), Malone's
performance stands up well.","The film has the toned-down feel of a television production; BASTARD
OUT OF CAROLINA was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the
TNT cable station, who ended up declining the film due to sentiments
that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly
realistic for their audience.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; I'll tell you when - never!""; When Anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy, Glen loses
his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct
them at Bone, beating and abusing her, while the love-dependent Anney
tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour."
41301.0,Nature of the Beast,1998.0,"A Victor Salva Film.; I know!; And the final confrontation makes you care about the outcome just
like if you were watching a serial rapist and a child molestor fight each
other.; Victor Salva.; Victor Salva.","It's during the last twenty minutes or so when the film completely falls
apart.; Man, I wish I had
put things together before I sat through this mess.; Needless to say, none of it makes any
sense.; ""The Nature of the Beast"" is a letdown, and it seems that writer/director
Victor Salva has no idea how to make a film, whoever he is.; Oh, no that was Henry Silva."
41480.0,Sherman's March,1999.0,"It's fun and funny--the limited narrative is very
understatedly and dead-pan funny--but it is a bit long and does drag toward the
end.; My parents called and said that they really
enjoyed it.; It doesn't happen very often: you go to see a film that everyone--and I
mean EVERYONE, from Siskel and Ebert on up to your closest friends, has said is
a wonderful movie.; SHERMAN'S MARCH is several months of McElwee's life on film--he carries a
camera around wherever he goes, much like Albert Brooks does in his comedy
about a family driven mad by a documentary team.; Well, Siskel and Ebert told me how wonderful SHERMAN'S MARCH was.","After a half hour, I was hoping against hope that this film
changed directions pretty quick.; The entire film disappears into a morass of McElwee's pointless emotional
ramblings.; This could have been interesting, had McElwee worked at showing sympathy
with many of the people he examines; but instead, he seems to be either holding
them up for ridicule (""Boy, folks, look at THIS one!; By the hour-and-a-half
mark, I felt like someone whose house had been invaded by a horde of boring,
annoying people, and had been forced to sit at the head of the dinner table and
listen to every one of them mutter on about him/herself.; By the hour mark, I was splitting my time
between looking at my watch, fervently praying for the film to be a little over
an hour in length, and wondering how anyone else in the theater could take this
nebbish self-indulgent waffling for another minute."
41573.0,Bad Manners,1999.0,"David Strathairn is perfect as the repressed, caustic
teacher who takes quite a bit of time to ignite, while Bonnie
Bedelia effectively transforms from a smug, married woman to
a questioning and more liberated femme.; Translated quite effectively to the
screen, ""Bad Manners,"" which is loosely modeled after ""Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf,""actually improves upon that classic
tale of marital breakdown with verbal pyrotechnics and
in-your-face audacity.; Saul Rubinek, who
has seen thinner days, is at his best when in conference with
his would be publisher (played by Julie Harris), changing from
full-of-himself pomposity to utter defeat when given the
publishing board's opinion of his article.; Matt is in town to
deliver a lecture at Harvard on a contemporary composer,
Vinh Schuman, in whose 12-tone composition he has
discovered a direct musical quotation from a work by the 15th
Century theologian, Martin Luther.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Did she have any idea what effect such an engagement
would have on herself and her husband Wes (David
Strathairn)?; Though the chain-smoker
probably smells like an ash tray, we can understand the utter
powerlessness of men to avoid her enticing charms.; If so, maybe you
never saw Edward Albee's play, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf,"" which features an alcohol-soaked battle royale
between two couples with host George doing his utmost to
humiliate his wife Martha and his guests Nick and Honey.; Wes has Nancy stealthily remove $50 from Kim's purse and
begins the night of clever word games by suggesting to
Nancy that if Kim does not bring up her own loss of $50, it is
because she had stolen the money and is embarrassed to
report it.; Since there is no way that
the Vietnamese composer could have come across that
medieval work, Matt holds that that quote must have been
implanted by God and seeks to establish a reputation by
publishing a paper on his discovery."
41579.0,Getting Even with Dad,1999.0,"Timmy may not believe his old man can be an effective criminal, but
Danson makes it perfectly believable.; The scene is great:  Danson steps from the bus, stops, and
thinks.; We swoon to these simple emotions, shamelessly holding our
breath as we wait for Ray's decision.; Forget the rest of the film-- this is one of those great, dopey
Hollywood moments when a character comes to life right before our
eyes.; It's great
schmaltz and the very reason we go to the movies.","Too bad that most of the audience will have either *left* or
fallen asleep by this time.; Too bad the film sucks.; Sartain and Rubinek are mildly amusing as Ray's unaccomplished
accomplices.; Most of the time, however, the pair proves to be more annoying than
amusing, with almost every attempt at a gag executed with dubious
aptitude.; However, good production values and
acting talent alone can't save GETTING EVEN WITH DAD to from
sliding in the oblivion reserved for Hollywood mediocrity."
41638.0,Broadway Damage,,"Hearing him sing
a song helps him fall a bit harder.; Seen 30 May 1998 for $8 with Andrea at the Quad Cinema ""Greetings from Greenwich Village"" is the subtitle to this bubbly little
independent film, written, edited, and directed by Victor Mignatti.; Broadway Damage shows young people starting out in life and
love.; Go and
enjoy it.; Considering it's practically a one-man show, it can be forgiven its flaws.","""Broadway Bound"" is not likely to be
considered even by its writer-director, Victor Mignati, to be a
major offering, but without its lead female it might
have redeeming albeit modest virtues.; Add in overly broad performances and some
laughable lipsynching by Panaro, and you're left with one astonishing piece
of cinematic damage.; ""Broadway damage"" is acting jargon I didn't fully understand, but I think
it refers to those would-be actors who are particularly stuck on the idea
of performing live on stage.; And while
it's good to see the Big Apple increasingly used as locales by
the movie industry, it's sad to report that this trivial story is
lacking in genuine humor, wit and originality.; Writer-director Victor Mignatti's ""very romantic comedy"" (as the ad
campaign states) is supposed to be (pardon the pun) a gay ol' romp, but
it's hard to have much fun with these annoying, self-absorbed characters
and their shallow personal problems: Marc and Cynthia have sitcom-level
domestic ""crises"" (such as trying to kill bugs--how hilarious); Robert and
Marc go to acting class (how riveting); the zaftig Cynthia goes on eating
binges (how original)."
41643.0,Combination Platter,1965.0,"COMBINATION PLATTER also attempts to present a different
perspective on the immigrant experience.; Once in a while, however, a
film manages to capture the essence of a familiar reality, and its
attention to detail can make viewing the commonplace a
highly-entertaining experience.; COMBINATION PLATTER gives an uncompromisingly accurate view, broadening
its scope beyond the daily grind at the Szechuan Inn to follow one of
the characters, Robert, home.; COMBINATION PLATTER is such a motion
picture.; Granted, there aren't any scenes in COMBINATION PLATTER
that will cause audience members to roll in the aisles with laughter,
but the movie's sardonic wit will provoke chuckles aplenty.","And speaking of food, it might be best to
see this film on a full stomach, lest you may find yourself leaving the
theater for the nearest establishment offering Moo Goo Gai Pan.; One might wonder what could be so fascinating about spending
eighty-odd minutes with the employees of a Chinese restaurant?; Then there are the regular
customers, including a pair of sports fans who tell ""great stories"" and
a couple that argue even as he searches for a memorable way to propose
marriage.; Ever wonder what it's like behind-the-scenes at a restaurant?; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

41659.0,My Life,1997.0,"Absolutely amazing.; See it, and enjoy it.; To complicate matters in his life even more, his
wife, Gail (played beautifully by Nicole Kidman), is pregnant with
their first child.; It is
amazing the things which we keep bottled inside, afraid to show anyone,
little things that tear our emotions to shreds, just because we can't
let go of them; such as anger, hurt, and fear.; Of course, she can also act, and that
gives her role of the wife a touching bit of emotion in itself.","This is no UNTAMED HEART, with an impossible-to-accept
premise and cringingly bad overacting; MY LIFE may have obvious
intentions, but at least it's skillful in presenting them.; In addition to being far too blatant about its
motives and having a plot that offers almost no surprises, the movie
suffers from an unfortunate case of ""cuteness"".; But
now he is heading for the biggest disappointment of all.; There are places where the script just does not convey what is going on.; This may be as much (or more)
the fault of the writing as that of the actress, though, since it's
hard to be consistently sincere uttering the occasional dumb line."
41709.0,Alchemy,2000.0,"In 
addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with 
the unexpected death of a loved one, it probes beneath the surface of 
concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process, the 
meaning of love, and the nature of art.; It's a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes 
the changes taking place in Louisa's life as she travels the road back 
to emotional stability.; As a result, while we're 
able to appreciate the film's intellectual tapestry, it is emotionally 
distant.; ALCHEMY isn't pure magic, but, especially during its 
best moments, it's close.; With its examination of death, isolation, character restoration, and 
recovery from loss, Suzanne Myers' new independent film echoes the 
Polish director's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; When the film 
opens, she's living with her painter boyfriend, whom she believes to be

41730.0,Desert Blue,1998.0,"Blue and Skye (mind the pun) especially start to hit it
off.; In Mr. Freeman's hands, however,
conventional expectations are reversed as Skye learns that
each of the seemingly faceless young people has tale to
unfold, some aspirations to satisfy.; The romantic interludes enjoyed by the kids are
dittoed by Skye's father and Blue's mom, Caroline (Lucinda
Jenney) who enjoy lively discussions in Caroline's coffee
shop while FBI Agent Bellows (Michael Ironside) is getting
drunk while guarding the road to the quarantined town.; Sexton III, known to his
core audience of teens and twenty-somethings as a decent
kid surrounded by petty thieves in Freeman's ""Hurricane
Streets"" and as a puckish adolescent in Todd Solondz's
""Welcome to the Dollhouse,"" does a particularly fine job.; Freeman is a talent to keep an eye on.","Even if a couple of travelers did check in and a)
Norman was not particularly attracted to them, b) they didn't
bother to take a shower...what would they do with their time?; Since Baxter is located on an aqueduct, water should have been
easy to get.; The predictably bitchy Skye is
begging her father to take her back to L.A., but just then, a truck
carrying secret ingredients for Empire Cola crashes on the side of the
road, releasing a toxic gas that may be poisonous.; When a truck carrying a secret ingredient for a cola
drink explodes, some of its contents spilling over its driver,
the incident is about to be written off as a simple vehicular
accident.; Not at all likely."
41759.0,Man's Best Friend,1998.0,"It's exactly the scenario that made CHILD'S PLAY such an
effective film -- what could be more frightening than seeing a friend
turn on us, especially one that should be entirely in our control?; Her character is written as unlikable and
stupid, and Sheedy certainly does the role credit; yet as incredible as
it may seem, Sheedy's character is the most likeable and intelligent in
the film.; The Phantom figured that Max (short for EMAX 3000, his official
designation as yet another genetically-enhanced product of science run
amok) was part of the ""working dog"" group, but it was hard to tell
exactly what breed this smiling, happy dog was.; Possibly the most bizarre sequence in MAN'S BEST FRIEND, and
certainly the one to get cat-lovers up in arms, is when Max chases an
orange tabby up a tree, follows it, then eats it whole.; It's a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the
theater.","This would not necessarily be a bad thing, since after all there's
nothing like watching a really annoying character get chewed to death,
but Lafia is curiously reluctant to show much of anything on camera.; The rest of the special
effects were so poor, I found them offensive.; Just the first of far too many continuity
problems in the sloppily-written screenplay; occasionally the Phantom
enjoys keeping track of such blunders, but in the case of MAN'S BEST
FRIEND it quickly became clear that if he kept count he'd need more
than two paws to do so; in fact Lafia's screenplay is on occasion so
bad that it seemed a whole litter's worth of paws might be needed.; Well, it doesn't take
long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon
the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers MAX juicy leg of
mailman, etc... Sheedy is a boring non-presence on the screen, tripping through
the enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer/director (I apologize
for a lack of credits.; Henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration
of the script, giving his character as much development as he could
considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film."
41766.0,Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful,1997.0,"This is a great film for those who are fans of the comedienne Julie
Brown, or those that think Madonna is over exposed and riding on a high
horse.; This is certainly not a film that has great significance,
but it is a enjoyable way to spend an hour.; This film is excellently written.; I, who happened to like
MADONNA: TRUTH OR DARE, fully enjoyed this film.; MEDUSA: DARE TO BE TRUTHFUL was originally aired on Showtime and
has just been released onto video cassette.","This
film is extremely stupid, but I didn't find myself noticing that until I
was finished.; Unfortunately for those of you, who like me, are fans of Bob
Goldthwait, he is not on for very long in this film.; He is not the
main attraction in this film, and I don't think that he adds anything to
it.; On a scale of zero to
five, I give MEDUSA: DARE TO BE TRUTHFUL a four.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

41776.0,This Is My Life,1998.0,"The film stars Julie Kavner, Samantha
Mathis, Gaby Hoffman, Carrie Fisher, Dan Ackroyd.; Julie Kavner has been one of my special favorites ever since she
first essayed Brenda Morgenstern on THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW and then
on the spin-off RHODA.; Since then, she's been in five Woody Allen films
and has played both Allen's mother (in RADIO DAYS) and his girlfriend
(in the Allen segment of NEW YORK STORIES), and she is in the forthcoming
Allen movie FOG AND SHADOWS.; THIS IS MY LIFE is a film directed by Nora Ephron and written by
Nora Ephron and Delia Ephron.; Of course, she's also the voice of Marge
Simpson and was on THE TRACEY ULLMAN SHOW for three years before The
Simpsons took off.","Nora Ephron's direction stretches out a half-hour sitcom into a
full-length snoozer, unfunny, dull, with hardly a joke in it.; And shame on the Ephron sisters for this
mess!; Unfortunately, I failed to allow for the Ephron sisters, either
singly or in tandem, who first of all produced a completely unoriginal,
entirely predictable script that features the worse parts of PUNCHLINE
(the Tom Hanks & Sally Fields movie about stand-up comics) and MERMAIDS
(the Cher-Winona Ryder-Bob Hoskins confection of a couple of Christmases
ago--Samantha Mathis even looks like Winona Ryder).; Ephron
has provided not one but two competing voice-over narrators, one usually
being bad enough of an idea.; Bobbie Byrne's cinematography is dull and lifeless, even as he
steals a shot or two of Vegas signage from RAIN MAN."
41778.0,Visions of Light,1999.0,"VISIONS OF LIGHT
gives an insider's view to the job of the cinematographer, interviewing
dozens of today's most accomplished directors of photography, examining
their work, and looking back on the great productions of the past.; For those that happen to fall
into both categories, it's a rare and wondrous treat.; VISIONS OF LIGHT is a fascinating film that will enthrall lovers
of movies and photography buffs alike.; ""2001"" is a great movie,
but it isn't covered here, only a clip is shown at the end
without narration.; Paradoxically, it is also the most important, whether
specifically noticed or not.","If all this sounds dry, be assured
that it isn't.; A movie can have a
good director, accomplished actors, and a riveting script, but if the
photography is done poorly, the production is doomed.; Still, I didn't connect with the documentary.; One cameraman says that he would walk out of any movie
that consistently uses a certain camera technique,
as if the rest of the movie elements aren't relevant.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

41784.0,Black Robe,1997.0,"So, a perfectly wonderful film.; BLACK ROBE is a powerful, beautiful film that is sure to have an
effect on the audiences that do see it, an effect that will be hard to
dismiss or forget.; BLACK ROBE is a must-see for anyone who wants a thought-provoking
film.; It is worth full ticket price.; The evidence for this is seen first of all in the priest, who
though very much the arrogant Jesuit, (a remarkably accurate portrayal
of that ""Society of Jesus,""); and though he is possessed of all the
medieval tom-foolery about a mystical paradise, yet truly is moved by
acompassion that is not human, (in truth it is divine).","It just needed work on its
characterization and actual storytelling style.; The dialogue is subtitled on the bottom of the
screen so the audiences will understand what the Indians are speaking.; Editing, Tim Wellburn.; Since it was a severe affair without any 
feelgood fireworks or aspects, it was seen by few people.; The film doesn't do a good job in justifying its existence - is it supposed
to be a historically accurate portrayal of the events, or is it a story of
tolerance?"
41785.0,Cabeza de Vaca,1997.0,"I think the film is worth seeing for the view it gives of early
Native American culture.; Although the abrupt editing and faith healing subplot detract from
the film, it is still worth seeing for the view of early (before the
arrival of the Europeans) Native American cultures.; Mexico (English subtitles), color, 1990, 112 minutes.; The story
continues as he heads west alone....; It's an
incredible (true) story, although the film appears to have quite a bit
of fiction mixed in with the facts.","Some
of the editing is abrupt, and there are huge gaps in the story.; These are not the ""Hollywood Indians"" of old westerns, nor do these
cultures resemble the DANCES WITH WOLVES images.; In the scenes that
are supposedly taking place in Florida, there are mountains in the
background!; As one who grew up in Florida, I can guarantee that there
are positively no mountains in Florida.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

41791.0,Mississippi Masala,1996.0,"MISSISSIPPI MASALA is by the director of SALAAM BOMBAY!, and I feel
that it is a very good film, and definitely worth seeing.; It was very well crafted and it held my interest throughout
the film.; Nair takes us into his
life in Uganda, where his forefathers came from India as indentured
workers to build the railways from the coast to the interior for the
British; she relays to us -- through flashbacks -- his obsession with
Uganda, his ""home,"" his country of birth, to which he had dedicated his
life as a prominent lawyer; his anger and bitterness of being uprooted
and expelled penniless from his ""home""; his relationship with his
African brother Okello; his identification with people and landscape of
Uganda; and finally his helplessness and despair as an exile in
Greenwood, always subject to subtle taunts by the extended Indian family
of motel owners.; In a way that us
what it is, but it also rises above that to tell the more interesting story
of a man who has lost his country because of the color of his skin and how
he must decide whether he is willing to pay the price to get it back.; The
smalltown ambience of Greenwood definitely adds to the unique flavor.","For if it were, then the whole premise is wrong, the
situations are uncalled for, and the characters are too cliched.; I almost
didn't go to see this film, because the title, at least to me, sounded
boring, and I had only seen one preview for the film and it didn't tell
too much.; One black does toy with the idea,
but it is clear the black family has roots too deeply set in the United
States.; Certainly the story
itself is familiar and predictable.; Starring Denzel Washington, Sarita Choudhury, Roshan Seth,
         Sharmila Tagore, and Charles Dutton
Directed by: Mira Nair
Music: L. Subramanium To call Mira Nair's latest film a heavy handed social commentary, 
would, in my opinion, be doing great injustice to this lady and her
film."

second viewing to comprehend it all.; Each one feels like something which began
as a case study but grew into a unique and fully-realized individual.; This complex and troubling show, which covers much wider territory

41805.0,V.I. Warshawski,1997.0,"But ... but suppose this private eye is different.; So far I could be describing
hundreds of different characters from Sam Spade to Mike Hammer to Mannix to
Peter Gunn.; V. I. Warshawski
(played by Kathleen Turner) is on the outs with her reporter boyfriend when
she meets and is attracted to a famous hockey star.; You know the kind:
wise-cracking, knows all the angles, good in a fight, heavy drinking, and
hard as nails.; ""Very
Inquisitive"").","You're welcome to V. I. WARSHAWSKI, a pedestrian
made-for-television-grade mystery that was instead made for a theatrical
release.; Even more comes from Warshawski's low opinion of the opposite
sex.; Next thing she knows,
the hockey player has left his daughter on V.; It would not at all surprise me to see this turned into an equally
pedestrian television series that will last one season and die.; Nobody, they suggest, can pronounce a three-syllable name."
41821.0,Ju Dou,1994.0,"The film is excellent in many respects.; And it is well filmed, though
the symbolic edges during the film tend to appear a bit old for us, who have
seen so many films, but
very effective for a society that has not seen that many films.; And the
turn of events is actually very unexpected, which is really the product of a
well told story, something
which Zhang Yimou has definitely displayed in his work.; Although it is not as good as some other Chinese films (whether
from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong), the film suggests that the stagnation in
the film industry of China may be ending.; The acting is generally
excellent, with a superb performance by Li Wei as the cruel, sadistic
factory owner who thinks he can make his wives pregnant by beating them.","However, despite having so much going for it, the film quickly
turns into a predictable melodrama.; It suggests that defying that moral code
is not a good idea.; The script is sparse, with the story largely told
by cinematography.; The child, Tianbai (Zheng Jian), grows up believing
Yang to be his father, and lacks the director's
sympathy towards Tianqing's intimacy with
Ju Dou.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

41903.0,Mr. India,2000.0,"(Mugambo is pleased!).; But part of the fun of ""Mr India"" is the
surprise at a picture made with different sensibilities and
expectations.; But our lovable
mahogany-coloured psychopath maintains his humility by only
referring to himself in the third person: ""Mugambo ho-shu-a!""; The children are now happy, knowing they
can look forward to a lifetime of atherosclerosis and coronary
bypasses.; Meanwhile there are
massive protests in the streets in favour of Mr India.","Peppers"" style British Army uniform and gloats, ""Did
Indians learn nothing of their history?"".; If this film had been made 40 years ago, it would have violated
the Hays Code on metaphorical value alone.); The now
transparent social worker can also romance the journalist, for his
poor fashion sense is no longer obvious.; When not ordering his troops to jump in the acid (where after
a few clumsy edits they turn into skeletons, ""Mugambo ho-shu-a!""); But with judicious use of a video recorder
there's no reason why you too can't be bopping to Arun's
bodacious rap and shouting ""Mugambo ho-shu-a!""."
41930.0,Uranus,2000.0,"This is very much a family film; if not for the subtitles, I'd
recommend it to parents as a good film to see with their children.; ESCAPE FROM THE LIBERTY CINEMA (Poland, 1990 (US Premiere)): Those of you who were discussing films within films, and particularly
THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO, will *love* this film.; The events of the film center on the growing storm in the village after the
end of the war, the political and moral repercussions of the collaboration,
and the way it draws both the guilty and the innocent into the turmoil.; One other character, Leopold (Gerard Depardieu),
the local bartender, a great bear of a man who is a drunkard, poet, bully,
and is fiercely independent of any and all political parties.; -ecl] DR. MABUSE, THE GAMBLER (Germany, 1922, silent): A film I have long wanted to see, this is Fritz Lang's four-hour story
of a heinous criminal mastermind who manipulates the fate of post-war
Germany with his genius and his incredible mental powers.","Interesting at points, but not enough to sit through
the whole thing.; [This is not good.]; An agonizingly boring film; the cinematography was good, but they'd
need to pay me a year's wages to sit through this mental taffy-pull
again.; And after about 10 minutes of
this -- BAM!; Without dialogue."
41963.0,Masquerade,1993.0,"It is amazing how quickly-paced things occur in, ""Maquerade,"" and yet, 
how slow-moving it actually feels to watch.; She lives in a mansion in the 
New York bay area, and legally cannot throw out her mother's last 
husband (John Glover), a greasy slimeball who is always bringing various 
strange women home with him.; It was only on my second run-through of 
the film, immediately afterwards, that I actually understood what all of 
the character's motives were.; Made in 1988, this film 
preceded the more recent overabundance of these types of films, but it 
is exactly the same, although not nearly as skillful as some of the best 
examples in the well-worn genre.; Look no further than 1983's ""The Big Chill,"" or 1985's 
""Agnes of God,"" and you will see a versatile, always impressive, actor 
at work.","I wonder if Swaim intentionally wrote all of 
his women characters to act like dimwits, or if it just happened that 
way, because he certainly does not flatter them in any way.; Just like the storyline, the film itself tries to 
desperately cloak itself so its viewers don't realize how very little 
worthwhile material is actually present.; One of the picture's main problems is that all of the 
characters are left at a distance from the audience, and so no one is 
able to truly gain our sympathies, or to even give us much of an opinion 
on any of them to begin with.; Developments in the narrative occurred, and yet the film 
seemed to be drifting by things without any attention to the elements 
around them, as if the twisting storyline was the only important key to 
making a successful film.; In, ""Masquerade,"" however, Tilly either chose or was directed 
to act like a passive female, and this was a highly misguided choice."
41972.0,Virus,1952.0,"If
you enjoyed either SOLDIER (6/10) or EVENT HORIZON (6/10), you will most
probably enjoy this one as well.; He was born in Saint-John, New
Brunswick in Canada, and graduated from the University of Toronto.; Actor Marshall Bell, who played Woods in this film, made history as the
first person to die in an episode of TV's ""Tales From The Crypt"".; Donald Sutherland is a hoser at heart.; This is director John Bruno's first solo directorial film.","The good thing about this lame duck film was that it knew not to overplay
its obviously mediocre presentation, and did us all a favour by slapping the
whole affair within a time package of a buck and a half.; So remember, it's quick, it's redundant, it offers some action and
mediocre effects, no boobie shots, and some campy acting by Sutherland.; Having said that, it is
to note that the plot was also as thin as Jack Nicholson's hair, and the
actors campy in some scenes, movie-stupid in others.; It's not even a good movie.; She was also once married to director James Cameron for a few years,
during which, she conveniently produced some of his films including
TERMINATOR (8/10)-which she co-wrote with him, ALIENS (8/10) and THE ABYSS

professional ... and two guys on a definite collision course.; An
entertaining cat-and-mouse game quickly ensues between DeNiro and
Pacino with the first half of the movie culminating in an entertaining,
but woefully underwritten scene in which the two starts meet face to
face.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","He ought to be ashamed of himself for wasting such potential.; Then,
after another totally contrived scene in which DeNiro leaves his
""deer-in-the-headlights"" girlfriend standing at the car, there is
another ridiculous scene in which 50 year old Pacino - carrying a ten
pound shotgun - chases 50 year old DeNiro about seven miles around an
airport.; It's hard to believe Michael Mann could get two of Hollywood's
biggest living legends and a multi-million dollar budget, and make a
movie that totally collapses on itself.; HEAT starts
out with lots of potential then gets really, really dumb.; So dumb,
that even DeNiro and Pacino cant save it."

retarded youngsters from the school julien works at, whom he hangs out
with at a bowling alley and they are seen as spastics to be laughed at;
a black albino rapper from Alabama ranting about doing your thing; and,
there is a wonderful scene, with julien and his family at a Pentecostal

a home movie shown to bored uncles and aunts.; The sophomore directorial effort of Harmony Korine (whose 1997 debut,
_Gummo_, is the epitome of love-hate films) is one steaming, smelly pile
of cinematic excrement.; Sandwiched between long cinematic wastelands are periodic incidents
designed to disgust us."

in Resurrection, and it's a disappointment here.; So let's recap: never boring,
pretty repetitive, so-so effects, ho-hum characters, zero originality, quick
runtime tacked on to an anti-climactic ending.; `Supernova' is a lifelessly dull, derivative mess of a film.; I can't
seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one,

review."

(Ben Ryan), Edward Furlong (Jacob Ryan), Julia Weldon (Judith 
Ryan), Alfred Molina (Panos Demeris).; Liam Neeson, best known for ""Schindler's List,"" has 
held very different roles in nearly thirty movies since 1981.; Notwithstanding these flaws, the film works because
of the acting by Neeson and Streep and the well paced direction.; We are shown the town and 
its people in careful, small doses, which is good, as the 
film, by avoiding much local color, can concentrate on the 
Ryans.","This crap belongs on television.; Even less appealing is Alfred 
Molina's character, a defense lawyer whose ethics are as a scary as 
the dye job he wears.; Both characters
are underacted and miscast.; Editing, Lee Percy.; PG-13 Given the people involved the film ought to be good."
43775.0,Guantanamera,1998.0,"The charming senior citizens have a wonderfully romantic reunion.; One moment captures the film best.; It seems to me that Alea is sending his viewers, especially the Cubans, a
message about the necessity to clean house.; It is in Spanish with easy to follow
English subtitles.; We see a Cuba whose inhabitants do not lose their sense of
humor but have to invent ways to survive financially.","How this could possibly save gasoline
is never explained, for obvious reasons.; Coffin-carrying cars are
supposed to form a kind of relay race with the coffins changing
vehicles in towns along the way.; But it was a
misinterpretation of Alea's complexity, and a matter of semantics.; Like that film, like much of the rest of Alea's output

R for brief nudity and a little profanity."

movies.; Other Sahara credits are excellent.; It was a strong team.","Bogie¹s: ³We have only one purpose, to save ourselves to be
able to fight again²  sums up the good and the bad of the film.; The gag (unverified by me) is that this New Yorker born of Irish parents
played every nationality except an Irishman!; At the well, the
small group will try to delay an advancing enemy battalion of 500.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

prisoners."
44201.0,Personal Services,1994.0,"For a hard-hitting, realistic view of the world of prostitution, PERSONAL
SERVICES is right up there with THE BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE IN TEXAS.; This is an uncompromising film that never asks
you to care for punk rocker Sid or his girlfriend Nancy, just as they never
seem to first we see Sid among the London punk culture.; This film came as something of a surprise, not because it was unusual but
because after a few good reviews it turned out to be remarkably and
unexpectedly usual.; Seen at the Seattle Film Festival:
PERSONAL SERVICES (Great Britain, 1986)
Director: Terry Jones
Screenwriter: David Leland
Cast: Julie Walters, Alec McCowen, Shirley Stelfox, Danny Schiller This is, unless you are rather prudish about sexual matters, a pretty
funny film, but it really doesn't get rolling until after the first half-hour,
so have a little patience.; These days usually Eastwood directs Malpaso films; this time he has allowed his
frequent co-star to direct.","In
retrospect, a lot of the film was probably intended to be funny but just
wasn't.; It is tough to say exactly where this film went wrong.; While there are some funny
sequences in the first half, much of it seems to be trying to make a dramatic
point about the dreams Walters has of a married life, and the realities she
must face in the real world.; The film's view of humanity as being entirely selfish and callous just
is too familiar.; Watch him for two hours doing the same thing figuratively to get a recation
from anyone who will give it."
44264.0,True Grit,1998.0,"Hokey at times but pleasantly entertaining for the most part, especially in
the last half hour, 'True Grit' featured rousing scenes of frontier
excitement in glorious cinematic fashion with elaborate cinematography of
western skies, mountains and landscape perfect for a western classic.; It's 
not as strong as 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' or 'Stagecoach' 
perhaps, but I believe it better than his last film, the strong 'The 
Shootist.'; One of Wayne's last public appearances was in 1979 at the 51st Academy
Awards in which he presented the Best Picture Oscar to 'The Deer Hunter'.; Wayne is also a 
master of the subtle glance, as when he furtively looks at Mattie as he 
tends her snakebite, to see if the incision bothered her.; I first saw 'True Grit' at the Westmont Theater in Westmont, New Jersey 
in the summer of 1969.","The ending scene, for instance, could be more fleshed out 
before getting anywhere near the danger line for wordiness.; Needless to say, the teenager Mattie Ross leaves many 
characters nonplused when she walks out of a scene, their brows knit in 
consternation.; Much of the background music 
accompanying the scenes smacks of 1960's and 1970's television schmaltz, 
stuff rejected by 'Gunsmoke' or 'Bonanza.'; This was before ushers ejected you if 
you tried to sit through more than one showing, so we stayed for the 
down time and for the cartoon and finally for the first part of the 
film, finding out that Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), the man who killed 
Mattie's father Frank, worked for the family.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

44297.0,Besieged,1992.0,"It's a light
endeavor that doesn't stay with you for long (although the ending is
powerful) but it's nevertheless an effective love story all the while
being a thoughtful meditation on the social differences of life in two
separate worlds.; Bertolucci directs with remarkable restraint and
understatement, making this allusive, meditative film a surprisingly
powerful and moving experience.; Their acting was first-rate and very unnerving, we could see their
thinking and emotional process unfolding on screen; it is ultimately
what makes this film somewhat special.; In ""Besieged,"" the great Italian
seizes upon a story of two people who could not be more
different, a couple whose physical closeness leads almost
inevitably to an emotional bond.; The story is simple to tell, but filled with deep emotions.","Whole scenes go by where neither character speaks,
engaging instead in meaningful looks and glances.; Shandurai's dark past is barely hinted
at, and Mr. Kinsky has no story at all.; Not even close.; The result is a jerky, confusing movement
that seems more like art for art's sake than useful.; There is such a serious
drought of dialogue in this film, that I'm sure Quentin Tarantino
could have made this entire screenplay into a 5 minute film."

high government official ""good press is more important than
human life"" particularly striking and original?; The film draws inspiration from the

refuses to leave his wife and see his life develop in the right
direction after he has been offered to play a part in a new Tarzan

captivating atmosphere found in the former IN THE SOUP (1992) has

especially Dr. Fuentes and Domingo.; The framework of the story is direct, very well-organized, and simple
to follow.; What marks 
this film as special isn't just that the surface details are believable, 
but that there is great richness and breadth to the issues addressed 
within.; Fuentes, played with conviction and grace by
Luppi, is a fascinating person--he's a man who has recently lost his
wife, and is now seeking absolution in finding his students, to see how
they are making their lives important.; Federico Luppi gives an impressive portrayal of Dr. Fuentes.","Rated R.  Running Time:
126 minutes.; The movie's message is clouded by its lack of specificity.; Like many of Sayles' films, MEN WITH GUNS stumbles only because
Sayles never met a two hour plus running time he didn't like.; The end result is detachedly
interesting, but could have been strung together to be a much more
interesting movie.; Fuentes believed he was preparing men and women to face the 
real challenges of the wilderness, but his lessons proved to be woefully 
inadequate."
44796.0,Arena,1998.0,"Nevertheless, the film thrived on the very good
performances by Gig Young and the supporting cast, especially by Harry
Morgan.; There is good comraderie among the riders, featuring friendly rivalries,
but there are also occasions for spats.; Jackie's sidekick is Smitty (Lee Van Cleef), a
tough cowboy who is injury prone and re-injures himself after a spill on
a bronco ride, which forces him to miss the rodeo and stops him from
earning a paycheck.; His marriage to nice girl Ruth (Polly) is on the rocks, not
seeing her for the past 2 years.; But the
love story is rather sappy, and the point about how dangerous the rodeo
is, especially for those who get older and can't stop performing, seemed
too melodramatic.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

44941.0,Year of the Comet,1996.0,"But as romantic thrillers go, YEAR OF THE COMET is warm beer.; Goldman is probably best
known for THE PRINCESS BRIDE, but he also has been responsible for the
novels and screenplays of NO WAY TO TREAT A LADY, MARATHON MAN, and MAGIC.; Scotland is certainly beautiful and Southern France at least looks pleasant.; I have to admit being anxious to see this film from the moment I heard
the story and screenplay were by William Goldman.; I rate it a 0
on the -4 to +4 scale.","This is way below par Goldman with
flat uninteresting heroes and far-fetched villains.; Unfortunately, Ms. Miller is no Grace Kelly
and Tim Daly as Plexico is even further from Cary Grant.; The film was directed
by Peter Yates (BULLITT, BREAKING AWAY, THE DEEP, THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE
COYLE), who claims to have had in mind a Cary Grant/Grace Kelly sort of
adventure with younger stars.; Unfortunately, the castle also houses a comic-book-style villain

robot's head are many of its inventor's memories, experiences, and
attitudes.; I rate it a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale.; A little if made of the idea that the woman
and the robot will have some of the same thoughts, but mostly it is a
contrivance to make the needle a little easier to find in the haystack and
at the same time to make it a little more dangerous.; Suddenly she runs into the unexpected, her temporary controller
is killed, and she starts running lose in the real world like a female
Terminator.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Instead, the government is going to use a robot who, short of
surgery, cannot be distinguished from an attractive blonde.; Nice things could still be done with this idea, but nothing really
interesting comes out of it.; It is an action film with a poorly thought-out
science fiction premise that happens on a few nice ideas, but generally
wastes them.; Inside the
robot's chest is a nuclear bomb about the size of a soup can.; It seems that missiles are not a very subtle way to place a
nuclear bomb."
45153.0,Eve's Bayou,1996.0,"It's also a
wonderful thing that a female African-American first-time film-maker has
done such impressive work.; It makes you realize perfectly that life can
at the same time be utterly chilling and incredibly dramatic.; It's a movie like no other on the market today, and 
deserves to find its audience.; Through Lemmons' inspired use of her camera, we may
glean a few explanations for ourselves so that we may feel some comfort in
our ability to comprehend.; Samuel L. Jackson, whose involvement was 
critical to getting EVE'S BAYOU made, is as solid as ever in a role that 
requires a less-flamboyant portrayal than we have become accustomed to.","An old voodoo priestess seems to be half
sham, yet her magic appears to work.; Poor
Mozelle is upstaged by someone with a genuine gift for prognostication,
and who would like to snuff out cheap fakes like Mozelle.; Eve seems to be
narrating the movie, or is she?; Other performances are far more
sporadic, from a nondescript Lynn Whitfield to a bug-eyed Diahann Carroll
as a cackling voodoo priestess.; This film is stupid."

house the Fab Four lives in and what they do when they come home is
hilarious!","Ringo of course is the bearer of the ring and is constantly on the run,
Paul gets shrunk to microscopic size at one point, George has an action
sequence where he's hanging onto a moving car (Harrison actually does
the stunts too, amazingly), and John... well John basically behaves like
a ten year old tormenting everyone, especially those in a position of
authority.; The plot
(which is completely insignificant by the way) is best described by the
back of the box for the film: Help!; --- Beatles drummer Ringo Starr after getting his hand stuck in a
vending machine... the first line spoken by any of The Beatles, in

classic, but letting its own dimwitted energy do its talking, for what
it stands for.; She also hears gold mine
mentioned, and when Clark takes Lewis' gun and splits from him, she
smilingly pulls him into her car and they are off together.; The characters all had
personality, and the force of the movie overall, had a desirable effect,

possible when viewing.; Lewis soon meets up with Clark again, after he romances a sex-starved

classified by most cinefiles in the noir category.; It should, also, be noted that both Dmytryk and Paxton received Oscar
nominations.; Arthur
tells her about going to bars and meeting a girl, and the couple seem to
forgive each other and are drawn close together again.; He was invited to Samuels' apartment to continue the
conversation, later on Floyd and Montgomery followed them and joined the
party.; He is a gentle person, an artist.","Finlay tries to explain the killer's bias by
saying, ""hate is like a gun.""; Paul Kelly had an interesting part as
Grahame's jealous divorced husband, but it didn't have much to do with
the story and therefore added nothing to it.; They felt it wouldn't look good to see
soldiers frequenting a prostitute.; The script was stale, the acting was wooden by everyone but Ryan.; He was supposed to be a John of Grahame's,
but that was too risque for the censors, who didn't want Grahame's part
to be that of a prostitute."
45551.0,Surveillance,1988.0,"On the one
hand, it opens up affordable avenues of production to virtually
everyone.; Digital filmmaking technology can be a dangerous thing.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Rotten sound design leaves much
of the film hard to make out aurally -- a problem that would have been
largely avoided had an aggressive editor chopped about 80 minutes of fat
out of the film.; Triplett may be funny as a sketch-comedy player on Talk Soup, but his
mooning antics grow tiresome quickly in a feature film format (which, I
might point out, is not supposed to be a comedy).; Unfortunately, the lack of attention paid to Surveillance (its
really snazzy presskit aside) shows through at the seams.; A two-hour
running time is far too long to keep an audience seated without a score
or, at the very least, some better acting than we're treated to here.; Surveillance ultimately has a few charming moments but feels more
like a weekend film school project than the daringly experimental
feature it desperately wants to be."
45671.0,Rough Magic,1998.0,"There's no debating that Fonda is an 
immensely appealing actress, and, in the right role, she can be 
mesmerizing.; Myra 
gets away from the doctor as soon as she can, and ends up taking a long 
car ride with a cynical, ruggedly handsome newspaper reporter named Alex 
Ross (Russell Crowe).; ROUGH MAGIC, which takes place sometime in the early 1950s, opens 
as an old-fashioned noir thriller (with a tinge of satire).; Distributor: The Samuel Goldwyn Company On one level, I appreciated ROUGH MAGIC, because it's an audacious, 
radical movie that is virtually impossible to classify.; Several people die but later
come to life.","Nothing in
the film made any sense; it was an insult to one's intelligence.; ROUGH MAGIC seems like a good idea that failed to make a seamless 
transition from the concept stage to the finished product.; Meanwhile, characters are 
spouting the hard-bitten dialogue of dime store novels.; It would seem that the film was done without a
script and that whatever nonsense popped into the writers' and
director's heads, the camera was given the command to roll.; By far the poorest excuse for a movie."

many times into so many ridiculous, impossible plot twists (including the
""happy ending"" that's tacked on) that you wish there were zombies or ghosts or
some supernatural forces behind this -- then it might make some sense.; The last half-hour had
the audience in stitches during the most ""suspenseful"" moments, and from the
opinions expressed by my fellow full-season pass holders, I would guess that
this is the worst film of the festival so far."

this level that it works the best on.; If you 
see the film, or have seen it, you'll know what I mean.; The premise of ""Return to Horror High,"" is admittedly pretty crafty, and

to no sense whatsoever, and so we are basically left with feeling as if 
we wasted our time.; The only problem is that, while 
much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made, no 
cameras are shown filming it, thus making it far more confusing than it 
had to be.; Watching the film, which was made 
in 1987, I couldn't help but take notice that the killer's costume was 
almost identital to that of the Ghostface in, ""Scream,"" and ""Scream 2.""; Rated R (for violence, gore, profanity, sex, nudity).; And the last thing the film wants to be is a ""behind-the-scenes""

detachment
and isolation.; ***** Perfection.; ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha!; The struggle against Heyst's ignorance
of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of Alma's 
love
for him.","Unfortunately, she is 
let
down by a superficial script.; While the novel is largely 
complex
in characterization, the   film sadly transposes Conrad's characters into
lacklustre leads, the most disappointing being Heyst himself.; While Schomberg should have been more
 menacing and vindictive, Mr Jones should have been portrayed as 
something
 more of an enigma.; The 
struggle
 to embrace the arrival of Alma into his solitude, however, is lost in 
Mark
Peploe's (director and writer) diluted version of Heyst.; Sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have
their charm, but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence
of an epic, which is what Victory deserves to be."
46027.0,Night Falls on Manhattan,1999.0,"One of the most refreshing things about this movie is the manner in
which it combines genres in unexpected ways.; While in the final analysis the film may not deliver a whole lot
more than some of the better television police procedural programs, it
is an intelligent and adult alternative to this season's fluff and
""blow 'em up real good"" films.; Not
only does it have a good feel for both sides of the police corruption
issue, but it's aware of the political rivalries and behind-the-scenes
dealmaking that keeps a city running.; Nevertheless, it
brings with it some powerful questions which a thoughtful audience will
want addressed.; The performances of Richard Dreyfuss and
Ian Holm, both fine actors with impressive resumes, are two others.","It
is a confused collage of cliches 
and improbable scenes, implausable story line, and simply bad casting
that results in a movie that is not worth viewing unless you are ready to
laugh your way through the last 90 minutes of the film.; Even the ridiculous aspects of the film create laughable fun.; Couple this
with the picture's lack of energy, save the periodic overacting, and
the shows bogs down hopelessly with the weight of its implausibility.; If
that premise is difficult to swallow, don't even bother with the later
scenes, when bozo time compression makes months pass as minutes and
Garcia's character is suddenly elected the new District Attorney.; Lena Olin, miscast and unbelievable as Andy Garcia's
love interest, portrays the most awkward character."

widows into buying modern artwork.; That was a
work of genius.","What a waste of talent.; This silly thing tried to imitate it with a variation
that was just a poor imitation.; Had it been thirty minutes shorter, TWO MUCH

two-hours film boring but it was entirely derivative and predictable.; The only one with any presence is Danny Aiello, and he acts like 
he's playing the heavy in a gangster drama."
46203.0,Jane Eyre,1998.0,"The international cast
is quite a treat.; The
acting was wonderful and the characters were very, very human.; One of the best-loved 
of all the Victorian novels, JANE EYRE combines social commentary with 
gothic romance.; Jane settles in quickly, forming solid relationships 
with her charge, Adele Varens (Josephine Serre), and Thornfield's 
housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax (Joan Plowright).; With one exception, the acting is excellent.","As if the casting and acting weren't enough to make this a bomb,
we've got an interminable story that just won't end, a really dumb ending
when it finally does, half of the audience laughing at the ""high drama,""
the other half asleep, and, worst of all, a film that is so archaic and
out-of-date that it's almost insulting to watch.; Franco Zeffirelli adapts Charlotte Bronte and the result is a
starchy, slow-moving soap opera that, depending upon your sense and
sensibility about these things, will leave you either swooning or sick
to your stomach.; Don't get me wrong, I loved SENSE AND SENSIBILITY (it even made my
1995 top ten list), but I gave PERSUASION one of the worst reviews of the
year.; JANE EYRE is based on one of those books you were supposed to read in
high school (entitled, oddly, ""Jane Eyre""), but which was so damn boring
you couldn't even get through the Cliff's Notes.; The result is a reasonably 
fast-paced story (with a confused sense of time) that occasionally 
struggles to develop its characters to their maximum potential."

the `loose cannon' Capone, essays his role perfectly, displaying the
right amount of menace and compassion at the right times.; The
performances and the story are solid (if only a little cliched) and the
action is tight.; For people who have not seen a lot of movies and are unfamiliar with
their conventions, it might even prove to be a serviceable experience.; ""Third World Cop""

Harder They Come""--about a country boy who goes to
Kingston to make it as a singer but whose record climbs the
charts only after he turns to a life of crime.; The central thrust of the tale
is the struggle between a good man, Capone, and his
long-term boyhood friend who has turned to a life of crime,
Ratty (Mark Danvers).","The script is
almost unbearable, piling cliché on top of cliché until we're left with
dialogue straight out of ""The Screenwriter's Guide to Cop Dramas.""; As for Carl Bradshaw, the film's most seasoned actor,
well, he's just irritating as the villain, comical rather than
dangerous.; The latest is called Third World
Cop, a drama with a simple, appealing story but dreadful execution.; Directed by Chris Browne Not Rated (R-equivalent for sex, drug use and
gun violence).; Paul Campbell, apparently a huge star in Jamaica, is passable as the
title character, even though the same ""menacing"" expression never
leaves his face."
46717.0,Intersection,2000.0,"A
terrific beginning.; Mere
moments before the impact, Vincent's life flashes before his eyes.; Ironically, this part
of the movie is where Sharon Stone has her best scenes.; The lead performances by
Gere, Stone and Davidovich are all understated, and Davidovich in
particular generates quite a bit of audience sympathy.; Efficient
editing by Mark Warner and glossy photography by the talented Vilmos
Zsigmond create a dreamy atmosphere, and James Newton Howard's jazzy
score plays up the romance angle.","What I can say
of INTERSECTION is that it was almost a complete waste of my time.; Coupled to this is the problem that Gere seems (as usual) unable
to act, and Davidovich seems poorly directed.; ""Uh...."" Basically, there's no plot in this film.; Too bad that INTERSECTION isn't a silent movie,
because the concept sounds reasonable until the characters start
reciting some truly dumb dialogue.; With a little
narrative juggling and some clearer characterization, they could've
refined this mess into something memorable."
46727.0,Speedway Junky,1998.0,"Most surprising of all is the casting of Thomas, whose
swaggering performance is a far cry from his previous roles.; Perry imbues the film with a seedy ambience and squalid
reality, but there is also a vague sense of unreality to the whole
thing.; Speedway Junky is a more sanitised view of life on the mean
streets than the provocative Hustler White.; Eric also introduces him to the world of
casual sex for money.; However, their involvement with Steven
(Home Improvement's wise cracking Jonathan Taylor Thomas), the street
wise, bisexual hustler who owes money, eventually brings about
tragedy.","Patsy
Kensit (Lethal Weapon 2, etc) is wasted in what amounts to little more
than a brief cameo.; However, Perry doesn't provide
many insights into this sleazy world, nor does he pass judgement on
the actions or decisions of his characters.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

46797.0,Tom & Viv,1967.0,"Richardson improves greatly as Vivienne ages.; Eliot's tragic first marriage has all the marks of a 
""typical"" British art film (or an extended MASTERPIECE THEATER episode):  
it's wonderfully acted (with one exception), nicely photographed, dryly 
scripted, and trudges along with the pace of a slug.; Beginning with their 1915 courtship, when both were in their twenties, 
TOM AND VIV spans decades, finally coming to an unnecessarily drawn-out 
conclusion around the time of the second World War.; Nevertheless, despite his obvious distress, Tom 
sticks by his wife although few aspects of their union could be 
considered anything less than disastrous.; - James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","TOM AND VIV doesn't try very hard to make an emotional impact.; Oh,

46915.0,King Lear,1982.0,"IF YOU DON'T KNOW GODARD, THIS IS A GOOD ONE TO START ON.; He never left us at all....
a must see for true avid film go'ers who appreciate the oddest things!!!!!; Actually it is just GODARD mere and
simple, and stronger than ever, defying the conventions of film making, into
creating something which can stand up on its own, and though based loosely
on the famous play, it really does well, as a piece of experimental film, if
not
a really experimental presentation, or attempt to anyway, of Shakespeare's
play.; As with much of his work, this is ( to my eyes and ears )
true surrealism in search of a reality through images in film, and the
script  just happens to be a loose form and interpretation of King Lear.; It is easy to think that this
film  is about something or other.","Maybe  aesthetically and intellectually it might have something to do with
that play, but I don't care.; This film may have something to do with Shakespeare's King Lear, but to the
common and unknown audience, it might just as well not have any connection
at all to anything ( NO THING ) except a mad man, and possible genius, named
Jean Luc Godard.; Indeed, films like HAIL MARY, are nice and
interesting but they don't hold anything next to TWO OR THREE THINGS I KNOW
ABOUT HER, ALPHAVILLE, MASCULIN FEMININ, LA CHINOISE, WEEK-END, ONE PLUS

I wanted to see repeats of the same half-hour story, I'd watch 
television.; This is a 
homosexual version of the same plot.; Perhaps if FLIRT had used 
RASHOMON's hook -- varying the viewpoint -- it would have been more 
involving.; In the Berlin episode, a group of 
construction workers discuss whether the director of this film has 
failed, and whether ""the failure is interesting."""
47099.0,Killer,1996.0,"BULLETPROOF HEART is a near perfect recreation of the 1950s film
noir mood.; What results is a solid entry of the noir vein.; The script is good and provides several large laughs.; The simple job of the hit man takes on
more complexities as the characters become fully developed and
intertwined.; He pops these little
Magnesium pills at the right time and instant courage just like the
badge for bravery on the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz.","They were thrown in for free
with another better film.; Unfortunately, 90 percent of the film is nothing but the principals
chatting--vital to the characterizations, but often lifeless and just
not engaging.; The
show never offends, has some quite good moments, but it just did not
work for me.; Unfortunately, these 
tend to be cut short by silly dialogue and so-so acting.; The low budget B films, if they were to be remembered
at all, had to make creative use of the left over sets and small
non-star cast."
47161.0,Djomeh,1995.0,"This makes the picture seem more realistic and much more enjoyable to watch
than something packed full of professional actors (like America's
Sweethearts).; Aside from the intriguing story of loneliness--of the insular,
rejecting world--""Djomeh"" is a tale visually told.; Mahmoud is open and sympathetic to the young
Afghan.; Hassan Yektapanah's story, filmed
by Ali Loghmani in remote Iranian mountains that in one village
scene resembles a community lived in by the Flintstones, may
seem distant from the lives of viewers from Beverly Hills, but
carry universal emotional truths that should resonate with a
thinking audience.; Hassan Yektapanah's Djomeh won the Golden Camera Award (for best first
feature) at Cannes, firmly establishing Iran as the world's current
cinematic hotbed.","The choice is not that of the Santa

hand Ararat over to one of two men:  the meek and kindhearted Moshe 
(Paul Sand) or the hard-hearted disciplinarian, Chiram (Ted Marcoux).; David, who is viewed by Moshe as a ""good kid"", but by Chiram as a 
troublemaker, becomes a pawn in their low-key battle.; There's a power struggle going on among the camp's leaders.; Like any true film buff, he doesn't mind viewing FROM 
HERE TO ETERNITY several dozen times.; They ship him off to Camp Ararat, near Stroudsburg, 
Pennsylvania.","Not only is the plot muddled and paced worse than a snail race, 
it's essentially one lame cliche piled atop of another.; And 
the poor writing isn't just limited to plot details -- the dialogue is 
stilted and insipid.; It's 
embarrassing to watch these performers stumble through their one-
dimensional roles.; Herbert Beigel probably had 
good intentions -- tell a story about being true to oneself -- but the 
execution is unspeakably poor.; Nothing in this story is remotely interesting, especially 
since it's child's play to guess everything that's going to happen."
47208.0,Freedom Song,2000.0,"But that's another rant for another 
time; the tale told in ""Freedom Song"" predates the jadedness I sometimes

Turner Network Television World Premiere Sunday February 27, 
 7pm Eastern Review Copyright Rose Cooper, 2000
Review URL: http://www.3blackchicks.com/bamsfreedom.html There will be some who flip past TNT next Sunday at 7pm Eastern, 
dismissing the movie ""Freedom Song"" as Yet Another Attempt by a 
White-owned media outlet to ""cash in"" on Black History Month before our 
29 days are up.; Before there was Martin and 
Rosa--two who were and still are larger than life for many in the 
Black community--there were the unsung heroes who put their lives and 
their livelihood on the line, for what they thought was right; for what 
they thought was just.; I was also pleased to find out that Turner Learning, Inc is providing a 
""Freedom Song Educator Guide"", along with copies of the movie itself, to 
schools nationwide to help prompt classroom discussion of the struggle 
for civil rights.","With
shaky camerawork, a simplistic script, a simpler purpose and characters
that seem to be cut out of the pantheon on the civil-rights movement
clichés (the outsider, the old soldier who gave up, the subversive who
has been fighting in his own way his entire life, and, of course, the
narrator with a conflict that he has to get over), Freedom Song just is
another example of why TV movies are only examples of what couldn't make
the cut of the silver screen.; It is with no small sense of 
irony that I watched that scene; having heard much of the same kinds of 
filth spewing--for vastly different reasons--from modern-day Black 
characters such as the ones in 1999's ""Thicker Than Water"", I truly 
wanted to cry from the bitterness that welled up in me.; There are, admittedly, some problems with this production.; There will be others who will quickly change the 
channel because they're sick and tired of seeing ""free at last"" movies 
[""Are you people still on that issue?; And more: doing something about the conditions 
that lead many of us--""us"" being people of all colors--to feel that we 
no longer vote for anyone, we only vote against something more ""evil"" 
than the other choice."
47302.0,Stardom,1996.0,"Also excellent is Dan Aykroyd as Tina's erstwhile paramour, Barry.; Denys Arcand's latest film is a somewhat fascinating look at stardom and
fame, as well as the silliness of professional modeling.; Soon, Tina is a household name and a tabloid fixture -- 
especially as she finds herself the object of affection of various 
powerful men, including Gascon, restauranteur Barry Levine (Dan Aykroyd), 
and Canadian ambassador Blaine de Castillon (Frank Langella).; It's a movie about how stars are as much manufactured as they 
are born -- how the way a person appears on camera may not only be 
completely different from the way they really are, but even different from 
the way they want to be seen.; The most striking feature of ""Stardom"" is Arcand's decision to relay his 
story about the medium through the medium: virtually every scene is cast 
in the form of a TV interview or documentary segment or something similar.","It's predictable and uninteresting, aside from the fact that the
very cameras that made her famous are also being used to record her
downfall.; But in too many other respects, ""Stardom"" is just not very satisfying.; In small measures, this would not have seemed 
so awkward, but because Arcand comes to rely on the ""documentary"" 
increasingly in the latter half of the movie, it begins strain disbelief.; It would have been nice as an 80-minute
picture, but Stardom stretches Tina's 15 minutes of fame into a nearly
two-hour film.; The book wasn't
particularly interesting, or well-written, but the draw was that the
story was narrated entirely by e-mail, faxes, letters and memos."
47333.0,Jane Eyre,1985.0,"The
great director Franco Zeffirelli, who created the best movie production
of Shakespeare in my lifetime, ROMEO AND JULIET (1968), has turned his
tremendous creative genius and crafted a wonderful new JANE EYRE.; I really liked the show, flaws and all, and recommend it to
you.; A happy lot, that school.; The music moves seamlessly between
the sweeping grandeur and the delicate personal pieces.; The movie has pervasive and rich music by
Claudio Cappani and Alessio Vlad.","To be fair, I should point out that my wife thought the movie was
""appalling bad,"" and said she was almost ready walk out.; I
frankly have no idea how he could have made a choice so bad.; She has the
long neck of giraffe and enunciates her words without nuance or emotion
as if she is angry at the director for requiring her to speak.; The film would be fine for any kid
old enough to be interested in the material which I would guess to be
about 9.; This is
the same director that made the risky decision to cast two young and
unknown actors (Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting) in the lead rules in
ROMEO AND JULIET."
47449.0,Denise Calls Up,2000.0,"Nevertheless, especially to
those of us who love our computer communicating, this is a film not to
be missed.; Nevertheless, especially to
those of us who love our computer communicating, this is a film not to
be missed.; **** Amazing, potent stuff.; And, although you can't lose
what you never had, that is one fact that they all keep safely at a
distance.; Standouts include
Gunther and Ubach as the unlikely expectant parents, whose budding
relationship (in more ways than one) becomes a necessary fulcrum
for balancing the almost farcical solipsism that embodies the rest
of the film.","The pace sags,
the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the
telephone-touters.; But even this
realization isn't enough to shake any of these young New York
professionals out of their interrelational torpor;  being ""zenned out
on work"" is the excuse for limiting their communications to
telephone calls;  when they require visual reminders of what
someone looks like, they resort to faxes.; If talking on the telephone is a weak surrogate for real human 
contact, then the men and women of DENISE CALLS UP are seriously 
deprived.; No Oscars here, but no raspberries, either.; You get
the drift after a series of shots of characters explaining over the
phone why they all couldn't make it for a party - nobody is going to
be meeting anybody in this film, they would rather be talking on the
phone."
47452.0,Love and Death on Long Island,1998.0,"Love and Death is a beautiful, touching film--intelligently funny,
perfectly acted, and absolutely realistic in every sense of the word.; Love and Death on Long Island is a wonderful film that everyone should
see and take seriously down to its most subtle detail.; All logic argues against his feelings, but Hurt's completely
believable and subtle
performance renders Giles' unquestioning love real.; For those
willing to enjoy lots of dialogue and little action, the rewards of this film,
and John Hurt's performance,
are well worth it.; If you can be patient, you will appreciate Love and Death on Long Island.","Dull, duller, dullest
Giles becomes an exotic creature.; It is not clear how much comic potential this story could
have had, but Richard Kwietniowski's screenplay and direction seem
leaden.; Much of the humor is unnecessary,
and all the characters
beyond Bostock and De'ath come across as either cardboard cut-outs or murky
shadows.; He wanders into the wrong cinema and instead finds
himself watching Hotpants College II, a dreadful adolescent comedy
that makes Porky's look sophisticated.; Instead of seeing an 
adaptation of an E.M. Forster novel, he goes into the wrong theater and 
finds himself watching a ""Porky's"" style adolescent sex romp called 
""Hotpants College II."""
47475.0,Mr. Wrong,1974.0,"The future suddenly materializes in the person of  Whitman 
Crawford (Pullman), met cute (but not too) around a jukebox 
playing the Hank Williams oldie ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" 
(performed by Chris Isaak).; Today you're the toast of the town, tomorrow you're just 
toast.; So far, so good.; Cast: Ellen DeGeneres, Bill Pullman, Ellen Cleghorne, John Livingstone,

Cinematography: John Schwartzman
Music: Craig Safan
U.S.; The 
balance is devoted to Whitman's relentless pursuit and 
stalking of Martha.","""Mr. Wrong"" becomes tedious though not awful (yet), given its 
small ambitions.; The choppy script 
substitutes stale, unimaginative material for clever, biting wit.; She has no discernible acting ability, no 
screen presence, and she's certainly not funny (at least not in this 
context).; If this motion picture is an example, not only 
can't it be done, but the result is downright ugly.; No, he's no serial killer but a total loony who does odd and 
tasteless things, and desperately wants to marry Martha."
47501.0,Six Ways to Sunday,1992.0,"If love is the message here, it is
not the conventional kind, but it is one that is stranger and stronger
than Harry's repressions, hatred and violence.; His mentor Abie treats him like a son, while his boss
Louis is pleased with his work and rewards him with a lot of money.; The hitman for the gang, Abie Pinkwise (Peter Appel), an orphan but
raised by a gangster uncle, takes it upon himself to teach Harry the
ropes, and makes him his right-hand enforcer.; While visiting the big
bosses' house, Louis Varga (Adler), Harry eyeballs a Hungarian immigrant
maid, Iris (Lowensohn), and is attracted to her because she walks with a
limp and he thereby strikes up a strange romance with her.; How the film got its title, is forced into one of the scenes, when a
policeman on the mob's payroll, Isaac Hayes, beats Harry up in the
stationhouse to determine if he's a squealer, but Harry fights back and
busts his nose.","But its failure to be consistently on
focus with its characters' comings and goings, in what seems like a
pointless amount of gore being displayed, acts to undermine the film's
artful plot set-up.; They're sluts.; I took it at face value to be black comedy and
found myself laughing often, though the people I saw it with, thought it
was over-the-top in blood and gore, and found little in it to like and
found the film was far too self-indulgent to work as a love story for
them.; As the film is too often off target, bringing up too
many subjects for it to handle, it just fires away, taking aim at
everything in its way and missing just as often as it hits.; There is no smooth sailing in this difficult story to behold, which
might have something to do with love."
47587.0,Suite 16,1997.0,"In
return, Glover receives a vicarious thrill watching him on a hidden
video camera while Chris makes it with the prostitutes he supplies him.; Glover's servant, Paul (Jansen), serves as the intermediary, looking out
for Glover and carrying out all his orders.; The ego-maniacal Glover has grown lonely and twisted inside, and
strangely enough is not frightened of the young murderer on the run, who
holds him hostage.; Glover is disappointed in the young man and
ends up inviting Helen back to the suite for some more fun (sic) and
games.; SUITE 16 (director: Dominique Deruddere; screenwriter: Charlie
Higson/Lise Mayer; cinematographer: Jean-Francois Robin; cast: Pete
Postlethwaite (Glover), Geraldine Pailhas (Helen ), Antonie Kamerling
(Chris ), Tom Jansen (Receptionist, Paul), Suzanne Colin (Woman with
dog), 1995-UK) Set in the French Riviera, this erotic thriller directed by Dominique
Deruddere (Crazy Love/Wait Until Spring Bandini), is a story about whose
got control: a virile, not too bright, arrogant, handsome young hustler
on the run, Chris (Kamerling); or, a very wealthy, crafty, older
impotent invalid, ex-playboy Glover (Postlethwaite), who is in a wheel
chair and living in a ritzy hotel with nothing but time on his hands.","The kid plays his part like he's a lump of coal and the sex is
so uninviting, making it seem just as boring as watching paint dry on a
wall.; The sadistic games are better delivered now with the presence of
Helen, but the menage a trois doesn't have the nuances, wit, or actors
to pull off the macabre effects it was trying desperately to get away
with.; There is no rhyme or reason for all this
sleaze to be taking place, except for making the audience into voyeurs,
like the invalid.; But even that attempt to get some life into the story fizzled, as the
film just wound down trying to outsmart itself with shockers to its
denouement, but ended up not being a very thrilling thriller or even
living up to its reputation of being a controversial film.; It was just a
dull, exploitive movie, distinguished only by the fine performance of a
good actor, Pete Postlethwaite, who was overwhelmed by being in such a
trying film."
47608.0,Mad Love,1997.0,"When Casey steals a car and they ride off together he begins to
have  some small thoughts that she may not be right in the head.; There aren't many sparks between these two, but  
each is hot in their own right.; A name like this clues the  
viewer in not to expect a hard-edged, thought-provoking drama.; Casey is a troubled teen because she has a strict father.; The acting is all of the understated variety.","Avoid this picture.; Even worse, the director (Antonia Bird) is unable
to develop any genuine chemistry between the two leads.; The script by, apparently first
time, screenwriter Paula Milne is so full of holes, unexplained
rationales, and unbelievability, that one wishes she would flunked her
college writing exams and taken up any other occupation.; Of course, these two are set up as the  
""bad guys"", because adults never really understand the younger  
generation in this sort of movie.; The big shocker in MAD LOVE is not that it is so bad (which it is)
but that it was directed by the same Antonia Bird who made the
wonderful film PRIEST."
47692.0,Felicia's Journey,1998.0,"Felicia's Journey
is set against the background of the bleak urban wasteland of
Britain's post industrial north, and Egoyan and regular
cinematographer Paul Sargossy capture some haunting images and superb
contrasts that beautifully underscore the themes of the grim
narrative.; In all of her scenes, 
Khanjian is the perfect, subtle siren.; It may stray 
towards being a bit too contemplative and deliberately paced at times, but is 
filled with such thoroughly copious details, and leads to such a satisfying 
conclusion, that it remains a fully rewarding experience.; In all the mannerisms he lends to the character, 
Hoskins is brilliant.; It makes us feel loved.""","Superior performances don't save the poor script.; Felicia's Journey 
is tiresome, hollow, and better suited as an eighty to ninety minute film.; An incongruous subplot that seems lifted out of a bad comedy features a
group of evangelical Christians as the story's buffoons.; Try Juno for FREE -- then it's just $9.95/month if you act NOW!; Okay, maybe better than that, but nothing to send
a postcard home about."
47724.0,Up at the Villa,1994.0,"Great job, Mrs. Brooks!; Her 
confidente (in some ways) is the colorful, cynical, flamboyant 
doyenne (in rank and fortune) of the colony, also a widow, the 
English Principessa San Ferdinando, played with the gusto that Anne 
Bancroft can command so effortlessly.; At long last, Up at the Villa is the answer to all
those unspoken dreams.; I first saw her in the Rumanian ""An Unforgettable Summer"" (1994, 
by Lucian Pintillie), a gem where she gives a four-star performance.; Music, 
Pino Donaggio.","It's just too happy being miserably boring instead.; If you removed every bit of 
its dialogue that strains to make sure we understand obvious details, the 
film would be half as long.; The ending of the movie is
also pretty weak and foreseeable, with much of what goes on, predictable and
tidy.; The problem with this
melodramatic scene, was that the acting was shrill and the outcome was
hardly convincing.; Hold on to your hats  Philip and Belinda Haas have made another dull
and slow-moving film."
47762.0,Scenes from a Mall,1995.0,"Back in 
1976 he had done superbly in THE FRONT, directed by the late Martin 
Ritt and scripted by Walter Bernstein.; Bette Midler can also be very funny.; They reconcile and decide they still love each other.; I'll say this much at least, that Mazurky's choices are most
eclectic and his devotion to great directors is touching.; There are some things that Mazursky is more anxious to show us than
others.","I'll go further than that,
this was a terrible movie; stay home and save your money.; SCENES FROM A MALL is a very boring movie.; The couple's
passion, unconvincing and unappealing, is further undermined by the
camera's insistence on closeups of their decidedly un-Adonis and
un-Venus looks.; Capsule Review: A terrible movie about marriage and
     infidelity.; No plot, no action, no lessons to be learned."
47821.0,City of Joy,1999.0,"One cannot help but compare this glossy package with the
gritty, wise, and wonderful SALAAM BOMBAY, produced at a fraction of the
cost of this film and at many times the insight and power.; One person has said, ""Disappointed to see number of notes from
fellow desis praising CITY OF JOY as an accurate depiction of life in
Calcutta, must see, moving, etc.; Joffe not only avoids what has to be running through the minds of viewers
when they see that sewer, and avoids the common overspills of the sewer
into the homes, he also avoids the bathing practices which are even more
of a marvel.; Albeit upchucky, Lapierre's diary is absorbing and
in some cases you might even re-read passages again and again out of total
disbelief: your mind wanders in unspeakable directions when you come upon
lepers having sex, and it's indescribable your feelings when one leper
gives birth.; This is what happens in CITY OF JOY almost right from the word
""go.""","If
he can't redeem the awful scenes in which he's mouthing the silly, badly
written bitterness that's supposed to be telling us something about his
character, the fact is no one could (Joffe originally wanted Richard
Dreyfuss; Lapierre wanted Mel Gibson) because Medoff disemboweled the
book's Max, who was skeletal to begin with.; I wish I could say the movie doesn't, either, but I can't:
director Roland Joffe and screenwriter Mark Medoff have indeed cheapened
the story in every way and worst of all is they have taken the good
American doctor -- played by Patrick Swayze -- and turned him into an
example of the pretensions of the ""art"" of dramatic writing right out of
Lajos Egri's college text.; CITY OF JOY strikes me as the worst of
its kind of orientalist, exoticising pap.""; Pauline Collins is wasted
as an amalgam of the religious characters that Joffe thought could be
vacated without spiritual loss.; They've given him a false crisis, made his
character diametrically the opposite of what he is in Lapierre's book in
order put him into repeated conflicts that Loeb only rarely or never
encounters, made him inexplicably suicidal, and gave him a resolution
that, evidently satisfying to the members of the audience who don't know
how Lapierre ends his story, is simply hackneyed."
47866.0,Gas Food Lodging,1999.0,"All the actresses and actors in this film do a great job.; The intricate, and well done, thing in this film, is the way each character
moves, and goes about their daily lives.; I highly
recommend that you try to see this film, in the theater if possible, and
if not, off video cassette when it is released.; GAS, FOOD, LODGING is very well written.; The
locations used are great.","The
older daughter has been raped and is basically looking for love, and instead
gets the results of it thrown in her face, right or wrong.; The film never gets slow,
boring, or tedious.; Allison Anders has opted for something else.; Both the mother and the
younger daughter take their time, and do not get involved in the sexual game
which obviously befell the mother in her younger days, and is hitting the
older daughter.; Film tends to create dolls out of many women, and never
allow us to see them as anything but the pretty things that many women can
be."
47867.0,Gordy,1999.0,"(4/21/96) (1/29/97) (6/13/97) [see also: ""Babe""] please visit Chad'z Movie page @ http://members.aol.com/ChadPolenz/index.html The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","But it's just so unbelievably boring, cliche, dumb, unfunny,
corny, and just plain bad it may scare children, it certainly disturbed me.; Maybe she is one of the producer's
relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something.; Of course there must be a villain, but even this villain (Donadio as Sipes)
isn't that evil.; It's hard to
tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional
because it is a family film, or if the filmmaker's are just this untalented
and stupid.; Of course we can hear the animals talk to
each other, and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the
voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible."
47881.0,My Giant,1992.0,"With great film comedies under his belt from WHEN HARRY MET SALLY
to the original CITY SLICKERS, Billy Crystal has shown that he's more
than the world's best Oscar host.; The long and short of it is that Billy Crystal, one
of our most natural and funny comics, teams up beautifully
with Gheorghe Muresan, a Romanian basketball player for the
Washington Wizards, as an unlikely duo who teach each
other some of the most valuable lessons that could be offered
about life.; Muresan is excellent as the puppy-eyed
""giant"" who doesn't want nor need much out of life.; Sometimes with actors
better than him (Jack Palance, Debra Winger) and other times by telling
stories that sell on the strength of their appeal which ordinary people
can relate to ('City Slickers').; Yeah, it's gross, but so was the 
overeating bit in MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE, and that had me 
laughing so hard that tears were running down my cheeks.","At this
point I found myself thinking, `We're supposed to believe that someone
would cast this guy in a film?'; How then explain that he wrote the story, along with David Seltzer
(who did the screenplay) of this one note boring movie?; As lamely directed by
Michael Lehmann, the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing
every giant joke in the book.; Director Michael Lehmann appears to have been 
going for RAIN MAN meets JERRY MAGUIRE, but falls considerably short of 
the mark.; The screen is over-permeated with Billy and this is the problem
with MY GIANT."
47889.0,Ruby in Paradise,1988.0,"The
toughness, intelligence, and resiliency are all there, and with the
deft hand of Nunez replacing that of Austin, this makes RUBY IN
PARADISE a surprisingly fresh and engrossing little film.; This makes RUBY IN PARADISE a rare
and welcome change of pace.; RUBY IN PARADISE is not an easy film to get wrapped up in.; Ruby may not be sure where she is going, but
she has confidence in her ability to survive and prosper.; Nothing of a monumental nature happens in RUBY IN PARADISE, but
the depth of the character study, coupled with Nunez's talent for
recognizing small details, makes for a surprisingly compelling motion
picture.","It
moves very slowly, and virtually nothing substantive happens from a
plotting standpoint.; It is rated R for sex and brief
nudity.; There isn't a moment in this movie
when Judd's Ruby is upstaged, and she's in every scene.; Ms. Judd repeatedly
outacts and outshines her co-stars.; It's too bad Nunez
couldn't have invested as much in the featured players."
48149.0,"Good Morning, Babylon",1996.0,"But the boys' troubles are not over yet.; And then,
in their dying moments (which are drawn out to a fantastic degree), they
photograph one another with a newsreel movie camera so that ""their sons can see
them.""; And what impressed D. W.
the most?; The great stone elephant!; And the
same directors did the very fine NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING STARS.","F.  Avoid.; A fair-to-poor film, ending in a truly astonishing screw-up.; This all winds up in an utterly and
unintentionally hilarious ten-minute sequence which was supposed to be a
tear-jerker, but instead had the audience giggling uncontrollably.; The plot is too simplistic throughout most of the film, and the
characters seem to be something out of a Horatio Alger story; D. W. Griffith
is treated like a cross between Leonardo and Moses, and INTOLERANCE is made to
look like the ultimate statement of anti-war sentiment (it wasn't).; The dialogue is
usually in English, since the brothers speak it after arriving in America, but
the dialogue is usually stilted, with exclamations that seem unnatural and
artificial."
48781.0,Never Talk to Strangers,1991.0,"Music, Pino Donaggio.; This movie's
Hungarian cinematographer has shot several American films, including
the 1990 JOURNEY OF HOPE (Oscar for Best Foreign Film), which was
co-produced by University of Illinois alumnus Bill Hartman.; The cinematography, especially the glow of the city lights at
night is lovely.; Compared to the ending, the rest of the movie is great.; Maybe, in a way, he's lucky for that.","Instead, this awfully plotted picture
throws our way a shipload of red herrings as it gets exponentially
incoherent, improbable, impossible, unclear, dull, uninvolving and
stupid.; As stated before, NEVER TALK TO STRANGERS is a poor excuse for a film whose
sole purpose seems to be exploiting Banderas and De Mornay's bodies as
often as possible.; It doesn't work.; I give it 1/2 of a star since I have seen
worse.; Allow me to advise that you never
watch this stinker."
48787.0,Mute Witness,1998.0,"Second, first time
movie actress Mary Sudina gives a compelling performance.; I predict many people will be turned off by it and a
fair number will walk out, but I was surprised at how much I thoroughly
enjoyed it.; MUTE WITNESS is a Hitchcockian film that tests the limits of good
taste, but nevertheless is a real treat if you can appreciate strange,
off-beat movies.; The relocation works wonders
for the story, adding a layer of isolation for both the American
characters in the film, and for the (primarily English speaking)
audience watching it.; An excellent
score, composed and recorded in Russia by Wilbert Hirsch, adds texture
to the largely wordless environment, underscoring Billy's silent
screams with piercing crescendos.","The director of the grade B movie, Andy (Evan
Richards), has no talent.; Is that supposed to be real blood or fake, a real gun shot
or a blank?; She's an American make-up effects artist shooting
a dreadful horror picture on the cheap in Moscow with her sister Karen
(Fay Ripley) and an American B-movie director, Andy (Evan Richards).; Even worse is Waller's decision to bring Karen and Andy
back into the picture as ineffectual comic relief.; One minute we are watching a scene where someone is being
stabbing with the blood (or is it really blood?)"
48834.0,Liam,1956.0,"While he's probably best known by the U.S. masses for directing John Cusack
in High Fidelity and The Grifters, or perhaps for his frocky flicks like
Dangerous Liaisons and Mary Reilly, Frears spent a big chunk of the '90s
making the two oft overlooked sequels in Roddy Doyle's Barrytown Trilogy
(the first was Alan Parker's The Commitments).; Con (David Hart) follows in his
father's blue-collar footsteps, while Teresa (Megan Burns) cleans houses
after school.; Featuring a stunning performance by Anthony Borrows as the
8-year-old title character through whose eyes the drama takes
place, ""Liam"" hones in on an occasionally happy family in
Liverpool during the 1930's, part of the city's minority Catholic
population which occasionally enjoy spats with their Protestant
neighbors, each belting out patriotic songs that embrace their
separate identities.; Teresa must face the guilt of preferring her kind 
employer, Mrs. Samuels (Jane Gurnett), to the mother who's growing 
increasingly pinched with the burdens placed upon her.; That film, which featured Linus Roache and
Antonia Bird, is a provocative drama about a man of the cloth
who finds himself caught between sacred vows and his own
personal beliefs, especially his closeted homosexuality, and pulls
out the stops in presentation of what Mr. McGovern saw as
messy Church politics.","Most of the story, however, is more tedious and clichéd than political.; It has one of those horrible and
ridiculously improbable ending incidents that occur only as plot devices in
movies.; In LIAM, the Catholic teachers and priests are
sadistic figures that make the devil look pretty attractive by comparison.; When Liam begins to speak, he looks as if he is suffering
through an especially difficult bowel movement.; However,
if it was the filmmakers' intent to have Liam act as our point of view, they
don't succeed, as Liam's comprehension of events would be quite different
than what's presented here."
48992.0,I Like It Like That,2001.0,"At times the film achieves some of the strengths of MARTY as
self-seeking family and friends try to interfere in the relationship of
Lisette and Chino, but with the exception of a surprisingly well-drawn
and acted Li'l Chino, played by ten-year-old Tomas Melly, most of the
peripheral characters are a bit cartoonish.; The film is good, however; quite good.; The plot walks a fine line between reality and satire.; She keeps her film funny-- sometimes *too* funny--
and never turns away the more sensitive subjects.; When she finally gets a job opportunity as an
assistant to music producer Stephen Price (Griffin Dunne), everyone in
the neighborhood misunderstands her relationship with the white guy in
a hot car, and the salacious gossip eventually makes it back to the
jailed Chino.","Griffin Dunne's record
executive is a one-dimensional cliche.; It almost seems as if
she was optimizing individual scenes without thinking of the film as a
whole.; Her only support comes from her cross-dressing brother Alexis (Jesse
Borrego), who offers advice rather than money (he's saving up for a
sex-change operation).; There are moments when beatings are
shown (obliquely or directly) but, with the exception of a
brief-but-telling scene, guns do not play a role.; Elements
like a transvestite brother saving money for a sex change, a
hot-to-trot neighbor, and a WASP salsa record promoter (Griffin Dunne)
could have been easily lampooned."
49050.0,Oblivion,1994.0,"Directed by:  Sam Irvin
Featuring:  George Takei, Julie Newmar, Carel Struycken, Musetta Vander, 
            Meg Foster, plus the guys who played the villain, the hero,
            and the sidekick, and the actress who played Woody's wife on
            ""Cheers"" as the love interest
Written (and Co-Produced) by:  Peter David OBLIVION is, simply put, the best low budget science fiction
western comedy filmed in Romania by Full Moon Entertainment to be
released theatrically this year.; Later, it is revealed that Zach is an empath and feels the
pain of everyone around him.; Redeye is torn to pieces by two skorps, but he
regenerates, so he'll be back.; The cast and crew who were present for the Q&A afterwards were
uniformly cheerful, enthusiastic, and talkative, despite the late
hour.; OBLIVION premiered in Houston as a Friday Midnight Movie at the
annual Worldfest film festival before a healthy and very partisan
crowd.","In the ensuing brawl, cyborg deputy Stell Bar (Meg
Foster) shoots and kills the big dumb guy, who is sufficiently dumb to
forget that he's dead, get up, and shoot the deputy.; They armwrestle before a Mon-Ding, a vicious poisonous creature that
can sense fear, setting up a painful comics-related pun.; Cue scenes from the already filmed OBLIVION 2: BACKLASH.; Reptilian villain Redeye and his gang of
caricatures shoot down Marshall Stone; they plan to run Oblivion and
break up the Guild monopoly on the export of Draconium, an
anti-technological element found on Oblivion.; The weirdo is
cliche-Spaniard down to his twirling hat-dance walk and castanet sound
effects."
49133.0,Lamerica,1977.0,"There is still other ground covered by LAMERICA, as it goes beyond
its cornerstone themes to address such diverse topics as the influence
of television, the dehumanizing power of greed, and the difficulties of
immigration control.; In terms of the issues it addresses, LAMERICA is an exceptionally
rich film., and as much a dark comedy as a straight drama.; Distributor: Undetermined
In Italian with subtitles LAMERICA, which had its United States debut at the 1995 New York
Film Festival, is a deceptively simple modern-day story steeped in
history, national identity, and other quintessential issues of the
""human experience.""; For those in
search of a deeper film experience, however, LAMERICA is a welcome
arrival.; Written and directed by acclaimed Italian film
maker Gianni Amelio (OPEN DOORS, STOLEN CHILDREN), this motion picture
is a must-see for cinema purists, art film lovers, and those who enjoy
thinking their way through a movie.","In fact, the ""average""
movie-goer will likely find this to be a dull two hours.; To me, however, it is nothing
more than a chronology of poverty without a compelling script.; The people all have a quarter of an inch of caked on dirt, they walk
like zombies from a low budget horror picture, and many have missing
limbs.; LAMERICA runs way too long at 1:55.; They never even built one, but they
couldn't be held accountable if those Nigerians did not prove to be
successful television set factory workers."
49267.0,Just One Time,1999.0,"The story's got a sitcom feel: NYC firefighter Anthony (Janger) is
about to get married to fiancée Amy (Joelle Carter).; But alas, happy and expected endings are the rule of the day, and
sure enough, that's what we get.; To my
surprise, he's not bad -- which probably means the source material is
ripped from his personal headlines (but who am I to say?).; He agrees; wacky relationship issues
ensue.; Both
are nutty and memorable supporting stars, not to mention better actors
altogether.","In fact, the only real dead fish in the cast is Carter, who
imbues Amy with, well, nothing much.; In fact, Just One Time would have been a much better film if
Anthony had ended up running off with Díaz's Victor instead.; Emotionally dead, it is
inconceivable that feisty Anthony would really want anything to do with
her.; The era of ""straight man dabbles in
gay culture"" is no longer taboo, and movies like Trick, Better than
Chocolate, and countless others that have taken us down this road in
recent months just don't cut it any more.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

49299.0,Dangerous Game,1992.0,"Hearing the 'c' word is pretty rare these days, both in film
and ... well in real life too.; The booze and the drugs are
real.; Kietel and Madonna took a plenty big chance, I think in playing
this dangerous game.; It is a picture of the gone world, a
style where the realities of performance and the pressures are handled
in manner not unlike shooting an x-vid.; The film within the film with stronger language than Cassavetes
usually deals with is simply a meller.","But in
doing this Mr. Bruce Willis-alike sounds more and more like a 90's
version of Stanley Kowolski.; So, while trying to justify the time spent with this film, I have
to say that it will have limited appeal.; Ever
notice that in this format the film credits look like nicknames?; There's probably an idea there too.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

moviemaking, that art still can exist in a medium such as film.; It is
very refreshing to know that there are still individuals on the fringes,
trying their damnedest to re-invent the wheel of cinema.; Scott King, the director of this emotional roller coaster of fun, brings
to the screen the vividness of a noir film shot in the 1950's.; Treasure Island is
a film for filmmakers and people that understand that most truthful
thing in this world is the words and emotions that people say in silence
to one another.; His partner, Samuel,
is a walking Freudian case study of sexual domination and homosexual
longings.","Add some repressive anger
syndrome and you've got one unhappy camper.; King immediately places the viewer in the thick of
things and only offers slight narration with location shots of San
Francisco Bay Area.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; Two
intelligence officers are assigned to the duty of creating a false life
for a dead man - including family letters, tickets to shows, and love
letters from kindred souls - and planting him in Japanese territory to
confuse the Japanese military of pending Allied military operations."
49462.0,Career Girls,1999.0,"It's a
fantastic film.; The storytelling works a lot like memory--there is an fair amount jumping
from the present to the past, and while this is difficult at first, it
eventually works very well.; Regardless of the refinements that are added over time, a lot of raw
emotions and memories are still bubbling under the surface.; The film's success depends largely on how well the two main 
characters are presented, and the performances of Katrin Cartlidge and 
Lynda Steadman are rock solid.; Katrin Cartlidge is especially wonderful in her
role bouncing quickly between sarcasm and sincerety.","Neither seems like a real person so much as an
actor's exaggerated concept of a character type, and these early
scenes play like sketches lifted from ""The Tracey Ullman Show.""; Neither seems like a real
person so much as an actor's exaggerated concept of a character type,
and these early scenes play like sketches lifted from ""The Tracey Ullman
Show.""; U2 when the filmmaker is trying to convey ""earnest?""; When
the ridiculously twitchy pair is joined by an even twitchier and more
ridiculous pal named Ricky (Mark Benton) -- all facial tics and compulsive
mannerisms -- the flashback segments of CAREER GIRLS become a real chore
to sit through.; There's at least one too
many run-ins with faces from the past, and an encounter with a former
flatmate who's now a jabbering derelict goes on far too long after it
makes its point."
49471.0,Get on the Bus,1991.0,"I love a film that engages my mind.; Another is an intense confrontation between Gary and Jamal about street 
violence, a topic that has a deep, personal meaning for each of them.; It is an
astonishing feat from a filmmaker's perspective and an effective technique
for anyone watching.; Some get better exposure than others -- 
most notably those of Gary, the light-skinned cop; Jeremiah, the quiet 
man with a poignant past; and the handcuffed father-and-son tandem.; Artificial 
plot devices don't divert our attention from the strong, heartfelt 
performances.","Even Randy Quaid drops by in one scene playing the cliched racist
southern police officer.; Pop quiz,
Hotshot:  you've got a movie about a bus, loaded with black male
stereotypes and rigged to make the viewer fall asleep no matter how fast
it goes.; It is rated R for the some bad
language.; The melodramatic ending, which includes a sermon on unity, is 
excessively manipulative.; Neither Lee nor screenwriter Reggie Rock Bythewood crafts 
more than one or two well-realized personalities."
49474.0,Go Now,1995.0,"With ""Go
Now,"" Michael Winterbottom--whose ""Welcome to Sarajevo""

war--displays his skill at evoking humor out of the most
wrenching circumstances.; Wrenching, passionate, and unforgettable, GO NOW=20

49584.0,Strange Planet,2001.0,"Karvan is solid as the ambitious Judy, and has probably
the best developed role.; Judy (Claudia Karvan, from
Paperback Hero, etc), Alice (Naomi Watts) and Sally (Alice Garner,
from Love And Other Catastrophes, etc) are school mates who share a
flat together in Sydney.; Croghan has re-assembled some of the key technical personnel from Love
And Other Catastrophes, including cinematographer Justin Bickle and
editor Ken Sallows, to give the film a cohesive look and fluid style.; Williamson provides most of the humour as
the desperate and dateless Neil, whose attempts to find the perfect
partner eventually lead him to a computer dating agency.; They all decide that they will find true love and
happiness before the end of the new year.","In spanning six characters and twelve months, the narrative
becomes episodic and lacks focus.; Despite an undeniably slick visual quality,
the film lacks energy and plods along.; The writing lacks the same smart
style and hip humour that gave her first film its winning spark.; Written by Croghan and regular collaborator Stavros Kazantzidis,
Strange Planet is somewhat flat, disjointed and predictable.; However she is only moderately successful in recapturing the same
freshness and vitality."
49588.0,Trick,1999.0,"The developing
relationshp between Gabriel and Mark works the way all good romantic
relationships work, exploring the way people discover surprisingly
wonderful things about each other when they least expect it.; Not only does ""Trick"" 
thoroughly entertain in the context of this genre, but it also stands as 
being the most uplifting and romantic love story of the year, thanks to the 
extremely likable and innocent lug of a main character and the crisp, funny 
screenplay by Jason Schafer.; The performances from all three leads, as well as many of the supporting 
actors, are well worth noting.; But they get foiled time and again, in often comic 
ways.; As the  mini-Odyssey proceeds among the night-life clubs and 
activities of gays, there are several asides, parentheses, 
interruptions and characters, several of those quite entertaining.","The subject is not really terribly interesting, nor would it be in a 
non-gay film.; Anyone attending ""Trick"" hoping for steamy sex scenes is in for a
disappointment.; It has a predictable romance.; Midway through the
film, the guys run into a tactless, overbearing drag queen who looks a
lot like a ravaged version of Spelling.; Unfortunately, he is also a walking doormat."
49599.0,Climax,2000.0,"Reportedly based on surreptitious recordings of other people's party
conversations over nearly 10 years the film has a vaguely anachronistic
feeling... almost like it's based on surreptitious recordings of other
people's party conversations over nearly 10 years.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Still, watching the jerks and the geeks collide over Dr. Who nostalgia
is enough fun to merit sitting through its short running time, though
its utter lack of structure may have you wishing you'd opted to spend
the night at a swanky club instead of swilling from the keg in some
guy's garage.; Sounds like a party to me, but a movie it really doesn't make.; And not to nitpick,
but never have I seen so much production equipment (namely lights)
caught on camera.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

49645.0,Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life,1999.0,"You
can't compare her simple convictions with those of
Kierkegaard or Sorenson.""; ""Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life,"" is not unusual for its genre.; It follows
a chronological organization, beginning with the subject's birth
in 1905 in St. Petersburg, her voyage to America on a six-
months' visa (which she parlayed into American citizenship
courtesy of her marriage to actor Frank O'Connor), her
meeting with DeMille, which provided her with the funds
needed to survive, and her 1936 Broadway success ""Night of
January 16th,"" which enabled her to give up her days jobs
and devote her time to writing.; The
human being exists for his own happiness, and not for the
pleasure of others.; After all, she admits several times during this long,
well-edited documentary, that selfishness is the highest good!","In a film of this length, Mr. Paxton would have done better
to spend more time with Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal,
Raymond Massey and Kent Smith.; While considerable time has obviously been spent in
organizing the material, little is particularly original or
groundbreaking in the structure of this documentary.; To gain more than a
bumper-sticker impression of the woman, you'd want to read
a few of her novels, particularly her seminal work ""Atlas
Shrugged.""; This movie is only marginally
successful in grappling with her ideas and the controversy
that emanated from their circulation.; We're all too likely to
leave the theater with oversimplified views such as ""I don't go
for that woman: she's selfish"" or ""What's the big deal?"
49709.0,Kippur,1996.0,"Instead, Gitai paints ""Kippur"" with devastating images of what the 
war did to his country and his countrymen.; But though the middle part of ""Kippur"" is a chore 
to get through, the final act exhibits some fine filmmaking, as Gitai 
effectively shocks us out of our complacency.; Reviewed on September 
30th, 2001.; ""Kippur"" follows two Israeli soldiers, 
Weinraub (Levo) and Ruso (Russo), who become separated from their unit in 
the confusion following the incursion.; Screenplay by Gitai and Marie-Jose Sanselme.","With a running time of more than two 
hours, this does lend the movie an agonisingly repetitive feel, and it is 
unfortunate that Gitai does not develop better characters on which to hang 
the viewer's interest.; Synopsis: On the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur in 1973, Egyptian and 
Syrian armies attacked Israel.; Officers are reduced 
to confused wretches, unable to differentiate the dead from the survivors.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

49728.0,Office Killer,1998.0,"*Office
Killer* makes a nice counterpart to *Denise Calls Up*, another movie in
which the reduction of personal contact thanks to technology is explored.; In *Office Killer*, Dorine
Douglas (Carol Kane) keeps a very different, more accurate necrology, one
created at her own hand.; The music by Evan Lurie is low-key but very
intense and sustains the film's edgy mood.; Ignored and
disliked by those who don't know her, she is chosen to be made part-time
and work at home via laptop, even though she knows more than most of the
young ne'er-do-wells at work.; It gets a lot less tongue-in-cheek as it goes on.","It's as if it's more annoying to have inconvenienced the work
routine, never mind that someone might actually be in trouble.; The worst-kept secret in my office is my *necrology*--a list of everyone
who has left the premises during my tenure of 3+ years.; The
screen credits slither over items you would find in an office by merely
projecting them via slides.; Dorine's murders are also extended to non-officemates; there is even a
corpse down there in the end that we never even see killed.; The biggest problem with *Office Killer* is that it gets very grisly."
49792.0,Queens Logic,1992.0,"I enjoyed it and I recommend it to people who like movies
about people and their relationships.; Tom Waits has an excellent small part as a
wonderfully strange shady character named Monty.; It's believable that these guys have been together for a
long time, and that the genuinely like each other.; This is the first thing I've
ever seen Mantegna do that I've really liked.; (The other things I've
seen him in were HOUSE OF GAMES, THINGS CHANGE, and THE GODFATHER PART
III.)","It's just a place, and not a very interesting one,
either.; The worst film in this genre that I can think of is ST. ELMO'S FIRE.; It's just not such an interesting place.; The screenplay could have been a little more carefully written.; The first one worked, the second
could have been taken out."

some of the best poetry to come out of the war.; Sas mentors Owen, who 
is a fellow patient.; Siegfried Sassoon is not only a brave soldier
who proves himself twice in combat but a mentor to the most
famous British bard of World War I themes, Wilfred Owen
(Stuart Bunce), whom Sassoon advises to stop writing poetry
about love and instead to transcribe lyrics from his own war
experiences.; In the
more politically and philosophically interesting situation,
Siegfried Sassoon (James Wilby), an officer who received the
Iron Cross for bravery and one who is loved by his men, is
sent to the mental institution though he is perfectly sane.; The movie's visuals can be stunning.","Despite noble attempts by veteran actors Jonathan
Pryce, James Wilby and Jonny Lee Miller, their interplay lacks
chemistry, appearing more like a chit chat between friends
over afternoon tea.; One attack has the men slowly falling 
like toddlers lying down for a nap.; Jonny Lee Miller, as Billy Prior, comes mute to the hospital.; It is just that he thinks this one has become hopeless and is 
being needlessly prolonged.; Typical of these is Billy's reflection that a battle 
charge is just like sex, ""exciting and ridiculous."""

trash, but it is good trash.; Perhaps I'm exaggerating, but my point is an excellent one -- it was a very 
loud decade, but not as loud as recent pop culture is making it out to be.; I praise 
it.; "", a film chock-full of cheesy retro designs, brought a smile to my 
face.; Joanna is 
a strange girl, I think -- she's usually sweet, but has rash mood swings, 
getting angry at people out of the blue, or asking them provocative questions 
such as ""Are you a virgin?""","never seems bad, and comes across as 
more of a screw-loose send-up of bad movies.; In the case of this film, 
though, I'm going to be getting letters and emails asking how I could 
possibly defend such nonsense.; The plot threads eventually come together in a scene that doesn't have any 
thematic resonance at all, and exists only to get us tapping our toes to the 
Bee Gees' song ""Night Fever"".; If 
I've seen one, I've seen a dozen films and shows whose characters run around 
alive with the knowledge they're in The Seventies, squeeze the word ""groovy"" 
into almost every sentence, wear huge polyester garments and disco-dance at 
every given opportunity.; But somehow, for all its lack of sense, 
""Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?"""
49929.0,When Brendan Met Trudy,1998.0,"He unabashedly breaks out in a song
that is both joy and redemption.; As the story unfolds and more film references are
mentioned and shown, we begin to understand that our hero is a tormented
individual who is in desperate need of a change.; The soundtrack includes a great, eclectic bunch of
songs (one from Sebadoh, no less), and I can't convey how wonderful it is to
see a film set in Dublin where people are clean, have nice jobs and live in
nice homes.; Reportedly Doyle specifically asked Kieron Walsh to direct the project
(the two had worked together in television but Walsh had never directed a
feature film before).; They begin to
date and, after a series of disastrous encounters, they eventually fall for
each other and make sweet, sweet love.","It tries too hard
to be hip.; It tries too hard to be quirky.; There isn't a firm enough hand behind the
camera to control the bland script by Roddy Doyle.; ""When Brendan Met Trudy"" is a terribly uneven film which doesn't roar into
life until its final thirty minutes.; After ""The Commitments,"" ""The Snapper,"" and ""The Van,"" Roddy Doyle's ""When
Brendan Met Trudy"" is a real disappointment from the Irish novelist and
screenwriter."
49948.0,Fantasia/2000,1998.0,"So even if you aren't particularly interested in the
visuals, the music is still damn enjoyable (especially coming from the
state-of-the-art IMAX sound system).; Hilarious hijinks ensue, 
animated in a suitably simple style.; Igor
Stravinsky's Firebird Suite provides the ideal musical tone for the
segment, making it the best of the bunch.; Nice story telling, great
expression and fine musical timing.; FANTASIA/2000 introduces seven new visual
renderings of great compositions, wrapped around the return of Mickey
Mouse in Dukas' ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice.""","Another disappointing feature.; It was just a complete bore.; ""Fantasia 200"" lacks the freshness, the novelty of the original.; It looked absolutely dreadful compared to the rest of the film.; The rest
are an overly reverential bore."
49969.0,High Tide,1998.0,"Judy Davis is one of the best actresses around today, and her performance is
powerful.; The script by Laura Jones is
intelligent and pertinent, the woman director Gillian Armstrong (My Brilliant
Career) has made a nearly flawless film, and the three lead actresses draw out
their complicated characters in ways that touch the heart with the mark of
unbridled reality.; It took a chance
meeting to bring them back together and hopefully it will bring them closer
together and add more meaning to both their lives.; This is just a brilliant film, my only quibble with it is a minor one.; There are no easy answers given
here, what the film does best is concentrate on how this accidental meeting has
a devastating effect on all three lives and it does it in a fresh way.","When
mother and daughter drive away together, there was an unnecessary emotionally
charged scene showing the mother thinking of abandoning her child again as the
daughter sat alone in the restaurant.; Only a real stinker would have done that,
and we already determined she was more confused than she was an evil woman and
therefore we didn't need that scene to know how conflicted she was in having her
daughter with her.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

act, who all wear blonde mophead wigs and jump suits."
49980.0,Ladybird Ladybird,1998.0,"LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD tells the story of Maggie Conlon (played by
first time actress Crissy Rock--more on her amazing acting later).; Meanwhile, Maggie has met Jorge (Vladimir Vega), a rare ""good"" man.; Rock, a standup comic with no previous acting experience, is 
incredible.; As powerful and stinging a story as LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD is (and it's 
based on real events), it's the performance of Crissy Rock that makes the 
film work.; LADYBIRD, LADYBIRD is a shocking true story from England.","She is the worst defendant imaginable.; Loach's 
films (such as RIFF-RAFF and RAINING STONES) are always doped with social 
commentary, and this one is no different.; She is literally a walking
time bomb in the show, but one with a meantime to explosion of 30
seconds.; Rock is shaped like the Rock of Gibraltar and is about as good
looking.; Those disturbed by that 
picture are unlikely to feel comfortable during LADYBIRD--but comfort 
certainly isn't what the director was aiming for."
49981.0,Goodbye Lover,2000.0,"_Goodbye_Lover_ is a very enjoyable lark of an entertainment,
but the film's virtues are exactly what made it such hell to market--it's a
deliciously unpredictable thriller with a dark, very offbeat sense of
humor.; For
the most part, GOODBYE, LOVER's plot is solid all the way through, and
the twists are timely and unexpected.; Director Roland Joffe, who directed the great THE KILLING FIELDS and
the not-so-great THE SCARLET LETTER has taken a different route this
time around, with a film that is a lot of fun but doesn't provoke a
lot of thought.; He
keeps the tension taut, revealing only select pieces of the
deliciously intricate puzzle, one at a time, with credit going to the
superb lighting and camera work of Dante Spinotte
(""L.A.; Besides being erotic, Arquette is also wonderfully quirky.","DeGeneres is horrible and her character is even worse, a tough-talking
vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair.; Every single word out of her mouth is
supposed to be racy and hip, but her incessant wisecracking is
poorly-written and merely stupid.; It's a mess.; And though Goodbye Lover is a
convoluted mess, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen that couldn't
be synopsized in two tightly-written paragraphs.; Patricia Arquette, consistently an endowed performer in such
difficult but intriguing indies like ""Lost Highway"" and ""Ed
Wood,"" comes across strikingly as a bad, bad girl while
Dermot Mulroney and Don Johnson fill the bill as brothers
whose only similarity is their affinity for plotting."
50008.0,RKO 281,2001.0,"Now we have the story
of Welles' s battle over ""Citizen Kane"" called ""RKO 281,"" a supremely
entertaining film with ball-of-fire performances and authentic period detail.; Minor carps overall, ""RKO 281"" is a splendid recreation of an era in Hollywood
not so different from today's - when big bucks and box-office revenues
accounted for more than artistic integrity.; His reigning ""Kane"" won its place in the AFI list in 1998 as the
greatest American film ever made.; I also like the moment when
Welles is inspired by Hearst's house or the puzzle pieces on the floor.; His film noir classic ""Touch of Evil"" was recently restored to the
director's original specifications and editing strategies, forty years after
the fact.","""RKO 281"" has many extraordinarily shot sequences, such as Hearst's dinner
party or the behind-the-scenes filming of ""Kane"" - at one point, a camera falls
off a crane as it is tracking in for a close-up!; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

50116.0,Simpatico,1992.0,"Things may not, however, be so simple this time.; Visit Online Film Critics Society at http://www.ofcs.org Mathew Warchus's Simpatico is a realistic story of long-term guilt, 
deflected love, and puzzling role-reversal.; I love a good thriller.; SIMPATICO is a very pretty film, and its
stars do as much as possible with their roles.; The acting is
solid, especially from Albert Finney (Washington Square), who plays a
former horse-racing official with a dirty past.","In fact, the movie doesn't even really
bother resolving anything regarding the secret, save for a few bogus
attempts by one of the original blackmailers to seek revenge on the others,
but even that doesn't really go anywhere.; Instead of crafting deft plot twists,
the film relies on random behavior and a confusing structure designed to
dole the story out in tiny bits over the entire running time.; Unfortunately for her fans, this film is just
another piece of dung to hang on the mantle of bad movie choices.; Lacking any sustained
momentum, the movie just ends.; Completely wasted in the picture is Albert Finney as the race
commissioner who long ago was set up by Carter and Company."
51043.0,Loch Ness,1996.0,"This is somewhat ameliorated by the beauty of
the Scottish tongue when Dr. Dempsey gets to Scotland.; The intense violin music by Trevor Jones is a romantic complement
to the lovely scenery.; As a travelogue that will make the Scottish Board of Tourism
proud, the movie is a success.; On the other hand, my son Jeffrey, age 7 1/2, gives the
film five thumbs up.; LOCH NESS is a joint UK and US production that has had staggered
openings all of Europe this year.","The prose by John Fusco (YOUNG GUNS) is
stilted and lifeless.; Ask your
neighbor to show you the slides from his last trip to Scotland and skip
this meaningless film.; The show
would be fine for kids of any age although I do not see why anyone
would bother.; He relies mainly on dumb
luck for his discoveries.; I want you to use state of the art equipment
to prove that it's not there."""
51228.0,Sound and Fury,1994.0,"The intriguing film should 
provoke strong emotions and raise excellent question regardless of the 
viewer's auditory ability.; He also sees that the independent and adaptive
world of the deaf is going to close in upon him and him and his family.; Putting us inside the heads of both parents, we begin to feel 
the pain of making decisions that will affect their children forever.; This zealous cultural protection is fascinating.; As the filmmaker tells of how
he received notice of the families and politely asked if he could
document their choices, you ask yourself if he knew the way the chips
were going to fall.","The single biggest disappointment of the film 
is that we never learn exactly what comprises deaf culture, but we do 
discover that large numbers of deaf people are extremely protective of 
it.; Is it because he feels that the device implanted in the ear
with a correlative contraption hanging outside will make her
look freakish?; The operation simply cannot wait that long.; Is it because he fears that the operation will
be unsuccessful and could somehow damange Heather even
further?; For some background on the subject, a cochlear implant is, in
simplistic terminology, a cure for deafness."
51398.0,Crackers,1999.0,"Swann seems to have had lots of fun in creating this loose,
extraordinary comedy.; There's also Bruno's bully son, Angus (Christopher
Chapman), plus a dog, Joey's grandfather, grandmother, great aunt, and a
rooster.; -----------------------------------

rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Enjoyable at many occasions but far too loose and inconsistent, Crackers
may be able to wrestle with the big guys, but it's likely to be pinned
down for its obvious flaws, and no doubt will be beaten by more
satisfying ventures.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","When he is not on the screen, Crackers
searches desperately for other gags to use, and ends up resorting to
ridiculous situations including barbecuing a dog and creating an offbeat
affair between two family members.; These characters are fairly
enjoyable to watch, but not enough development is given to any one of
them.; The screenplay is confused and flirts between genre to genre,
consequently being funny without being entirely a comedy, and dramatic
without being entirely a drama.; No doubt last years The
Castle gave inspiration to this Aussie backyard adventure, and whilst it
is nice to see another Australian comedy wrestling with the big guys,
Crackers fails to have the low brow, witty sense of humor that its
predecessor was loved for.; Whether or not that is good or bad is
not entirely relevant, because director David Swann has made sure that,
although sometimes at sparse occasions, there is a laugh included for
most audiences."
51437.0,Rat Race,1988.0,"It was the simple, unaffected laughter of delight in
simple, easy pleasure.; The man is brilliant as a serious actor; I've enjoyed him
thoroughly, without pause, in films like Boyz N The Hood and Men Of
Honor.; What looks like a disjointed,
multi-storyline wackofest is actually a beautifully shot, action-packed
comedy with a little something for everyone.; We recollected all our favorite moments, which were legion, and
laughed afresh.; There's slapstick, situational humor,
subtle physicality, tumbling disaster, Darwin-award behavior, good natured
humor, mistaken identity, peril, insanity, over-the-top, observational
humor, corn-pone chuckles, surreal visual gags, and even an homage to a
classic Lucy episode - whatever you like, they got it!","The biggest problem with RAT RACE for me was that it just plain wasn't
funny; not funny enough, anyway, to mask some huge logic holes (I'd say
""plot holes"", normally, but there was no real plot.; RAT RACE (rating: yellowlight.gif):
Not even a funny invocation of Godwin's Law, could save this drowning
mouse.; Save me the effort of another ""This Moment In
Black Buffoonery"" created just for him.; Indeed, I'd rather see a
funny actor of whatever race being allowed to be funny, over them being
made the Hero just to avoid the tricky subjects of race, class, and
culture (which, really, doesn't avoid them at all.; Scared because in watching it, I
just might realize that it's just as dumb as RAT RACE was."
51719.0,Black Angel,1997.0,"The film also presented an excellent character study of the Dan Duryea
character, making him into a complicated black angel figure.; His alibi is that his good
friend Joe locked him in his shabby room after the alcoholic got drunk,
something he always does to prevent Marty from getting into further trouble.; Marion Martin (Millie), Mary Fields (Maid); Runtime: 80; Universal; 1946) Black Angel is a film noir armed with the following: a brilliant script by Roy
Chanslor that is taken from a Cornell Woolrich novel, an engaging performance
turned in by Dan Duryea who is in a rare role as someone sympathetic, and it is
directed flawlessly with craft-like skills by Roy William Neill.; The low-budget film had a stunning simplicity to it that evoked all kinds of
feelings for the players involved in this imaginative story and dramatic
tragedy.; When after all their undercover work Marko turns out to be
innocent, Marty feels that Kirk must be guilty.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; The self-pitying musical composer and piano player husband, Marty Blair
(Duryea), of obnoxious but sexy nightclub singer Mavis Marlowe (Dowling), tries
to get her to remember their wedding anniversary by sending her the jeweled,
heart-shaped brooch he gave her when they were married but she left behind when
she split from him."
51775.0,High Noon,2000.0,"Thomas Mitchell is excellent as hypocritical leader of the
town.; That happened mostly thanks to the great script by Carl
Foreman (whose later works would include a masterpiece like
THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI).; Harvey, Kane's
young and ambitious deputy, only complicated story that was
perfect in its simplicity.; This
film is often regarded as one of the best and most
influential films of all time.; Kane in this scene shows a great amount of fear, and we find our
hero is full of doubt.","The other one is the title song, written by
Dimitri Tiomkin and sung by Tex Ritter, which is nice by
itself; unfortunately, it is overplayed during the whole
course of picture and gets really tedious.; The role played by Lloyd Bridges, although well played,
should have been left out of the picture.; If they
co-operated, they had to name names and they knew that even
the most innocent innuendo about someone's leftist leanings
could brand such person a Communist and practically end his
career in Hollywood.; Her character somehow manages to
be the former girlfriend of Cooper, Bridges and
Ian MacDonald, who plays the lead bad guy.; All of this for an undeserving, ungrateful
town."
51942.0,I Married a Strange Person!,1998.0,"The man in question is cult animator Bill Plympton, and his latest
and most ambitious project to date is a full-length animated feature with
the provocative title ""I Married a Strange Person!""; The
director crams so much into the film's comparatively brief running time
that it's actually a little bit exhausting at times; however, among the
bang bang bangs and the blam blam blams, Plympton's impeccable sense of
comic timing shines through.; is an eye-opening change of pace for
anyone brought up on Road Runner cartoons.; It's a memorable
journey through the tormented, talented mind of Bill Plympton.; As the film opens, a pair of coupling birds (there's a lot of
coupling in this film, often by inanimate objects) spiral out of control
and crash land onto a satellite dish, sending a bolt of energy into the
nape of our angular hero.","If you're a connoisseur of ultra sex and ultra violence, ""I Married
a Strange Person!""; isn't rated but its graphic visual
style is definitely not for kids.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
51955.0,Hav Plenty,1999.0,"It isn't the most adept feature I've seen recently, 
but it is energetic, earnest, and (at least at times) endearing.; Cherot's direction is more assured than his acting, and he
gets generally strong performances from his cast.; Narrated by Christopher Scott Cherot (who also
wrote, directed, edited and stars in this little gem), ""Hav
Plenty"" is a movie within a movie, a Pirandellian report of a
series of events that occurred in the life of its director during
the course of a year.; HAV PLENTY opens with a caption assuring us that this is a true 
story.; HAV PLENTY ends with Lee finding
success as the ""true story"" of his relationship with Havilland becomes his
first film.","HAV PLENTY isn't
so much a bad film as it is a total waste of the audience's time.; Hav tells the camera, but the problem is that it's not
outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting.; A messy puppy may be cute, but all grown up he's just a
mess.; This movie begins  like an amateurish 8mm home movie , but soon at least
the quality of the film  stock  improves.; - that the actors are
content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying
to act it."
52226.0,See Jane Run,2000.0,"Starring Clea 
DuVall (GIRL, INTERRUPTED and BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER) as Jane, an unhappy 
L.A. waitress with a couple of quirky roommates, the movie plays like a 
series of impromptu comedy sketches.; Jane's downfall as a criminal is her inability to identify the right 
loot.; Web: http://www.InternetReviews.com

and you meet nice people all of the time,"" she decides gleefully.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Marvin practices his 
bad screenwriting, and Gina overacts with a vengeance.; Helping her are her roommates, Marvin (Richmond Arquette), a writer with 
a permanent writer's block, and Gina (Jennifer Aspen), a perky actress 
with 654 auditions under her belt and zero parts.; What does one do with tins of Spam or pet toys for a non-existent 
dog?; It is not rated but might be PG-13 for language 
and mature subject matter.; Director Sarah Thorp's only inabilities stem from inexperience."
52395.0,Fear,1993.0,"The romantic obsession part works marginally well, but the film's
commentary on teenagers and their relationships with their parents is
insightful and worth hearing.; On the good side, I must be honest
that the movie does feature a genuinely erotic roller coaster ride.; A surprisingly
engaging ending also keeps the film from collapsing on itself.; You're my only friend.""; The latest member of this not-too-exclusive club is James Foley's FEAR, 
a kinetic, visually dazzling thriller that's actually a notch above many 
of its predecessors -- albeit only a small notch.","The huge downfall in the picture, is
that the writers run out of ideas, so they transform the last thirty
minutes of the film into a bad, tasteless, and frightening horror
flick.; Completing the terrible triumvirate is Alyssa Milano, wildly overacting
as Nichole's slut girlfriend (a.k.a.; This exchange establishes early on two 
vital components of the movie -- horrendous dialogue and bad 
acting.; Who better to contribute to the bad acting than B-movie 
queen Alyssa Milano?; The film is correctly rated R for gory and
frightening violence, animal mutilation, crack smoking, some bad
language, a little sex, but no nudity."
52471.0,American Dreamer,2000.0,"The show gets really
loony at this point, but Williams plays the role with great panache and
with her good sense of comedic timing pulls it off brilliantly.; If you
like romantic fairy tales and light hearted comedies, then you may find
this is the simple sort of fable perfect for a rainy day.; I recommend this little
picture to you and give it ***.; Rebecca is a brilliant
international spy who is fluent in five languages and is a martial arts
master.; I love
watching Williams.","It is rated PG
for reasons of which I am not quite sure.; Cathy Palmer (JoBeth Williams) is a housewife and would be writer.; There is no sex, nudity,
violence or bad language.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; It would be fine for any kid old enough to
be interested in a comedy featuring adults."
52508.0,I'll Be Home for Christmas,1995.0,"While no ""It's a 
Wonderful Life,"" this jolly little slice of fruitcake plays like a 
surprise gift from the folks that you don't necessarily want to return 
on December 26th.; Jake meets a 
clueless thief (Andrew Lauer, the guy on skates from ""Caroline in the 
City"") and a heartsick cop (Sean O'Bryan), leading up to a cute scene 
that is both sentimental and funny.; And Jessica Biel, who starred in last year's ""Ulee's Gold,"" is perfect 
as his girfriend, and perhaps the standout in the cast.; The adventures that ensue in the forest setting, ranging from some wild
river rafting to an encounter with circus monkeys, are sure to keep the
children enthralled (the kids at the screening I attended were noticeably
silent) and amuse the adults.; My son Jeffrey, age 9, thought the film was ""really good"" and gave it
*** ½.","The mildly-embarrassed Eddie grabs something to cover his genitals, Allie 
shows no reaction whatsoever, and I scratched my head, wondering why a 
scene as illogical, poorly-staged and unfunny as this one was left in the 
film.; As lame and predictable as the story is, the key problem is
Taylor Thomas himself.; Bemoaning ""I'll Be Home for Christmas""' lack of originality is pretty 
much a waste of time and effort, since you're aware going in that this 
isn't the type of film to break new ground as far as narrative or 
characters are concerned.; Vapid, sloppily made and utterly without merit, ""I'll Be Home For
Christmas"" qualifies as ho-ho-horrible.; There are elements that don't work in the film, however, starting with 
the character of Eddie, who was very annoying and basically a 
one-dimensional creep."
53113.0,One True Thing,,"Streep is typically superb, and her beautifully understated
performance is both painfully realistic and moving.; A film of quiet emotions and subtle power, ONE TRUE
THING, directed by ONE FALSE MOVE's Carl Franklin, has three marvelous
performances and a touching story.; A film of quiet emotions and subtle power, ONE TRUE
THING, directed by ONE FALSE MOVE's Carl Franklin, has three marvelous
performances and a touching story.; Email a more exciting tale to Redman@indepen.com.); Combining that with top notch performances and an easy
flowing sense of style, 'One True Thing' does pay off and is especially
important to film audiences that can identify with its subject matter.","That's also
the reason it was so disappointing to watch the film linger on a foregone
conclusion.; For instance, Professor George Gulden comes off as pompous, a 
phony who relies on a couple of quotes, one stolen, to impress his 
listeners.; The balancing act this movie performs once again fails in the category
of under written characters.; And all this falls in Ellen's
lap, who doesn't have a decorative bone in her entire body.; Part of the problem lies in the clumsy structure, clearly a
hangover from the novel."
53263.0,Price of Glory,1993.0,"Familiar archetypes emerge and follow their
routes to a traditional grand finale.; Above all, Jimmy Smits gives a winning performance as patriarch Arturo 
Ortega.; Nevertheless, as the boys grow older, Sonny (Jon Seda), Jimmy (Clifton 
Collins, Jr.) and Johnny (Ernesto Hernandez) become the ""Fighting Ortegas"" 
yet it is Johnny, the youngest and meanest of the bunch, who becomes the 
likely prizefighter to become heavyweight champion.; Still, ""Price of Glory"" is the kind of film that tastes good 
on the surface yet leaves a bitter after taste once you consider how the 
ingredients were mixed.; His familiarity with the sport
comes across throughout the movie, as he tackles the roles
of managers, trainers, and referees and gives us a view of
the temperaments of the pugilists, particularly one villainous
opponent, Davey Lane (Louis Mandylor) in a middleweight
title bout that forms the dramatic climax of the tale.","This doesn't make
up for the clichés, script or Jimmy Smits however.; Despite
the excitement generated by the soundtrack and the swiftly
paced action of the drama, the movie lacks virtually any trace
of originality.; While the film moves through the Silver Gloves years quickly, the very
idea of putting single digit kidlets in the ring is brutal and
unappealing and downright unpleasant to sit through.; And maybe it was Just 
Me, but Louis Mandylor just did not look like he belonged in a boxing 
ring, though his turn as the rather mean-spirited Davey Lane did seem to 
serve as a needed bit of conflict and tension that was missing from most 
of the movie.; Arturo thinks one of his boys doesn't have the makings of a
champion, but maybe he isn't looking hard enough."
53818.0,Hero,1994.0,"Bubber *is* a good man, whom fate has conspired to keep hidden.; And, surprisingly enough, he *is* a hero, in
all but deed.; The movie takes about one third of its length to set that all up,
and does a good job of it.; And while he is being a hero, the world, who expects so little
from him, never gives him a chance to explain.; I enjoyed this movie, although it was not enough to grab my entire
attention (otherwise, I would not have been able to keep thinking about
classifying the themes throughout the movie!).","But she lets her guard down while receiving an
award, to show that she is tired of uncovering the half-truths and
deceptions of supposedly ""good"" people to find the dirt beneath, or even
of finding that the ""dirt"" is, itself, a deception.; (In
fact, the only thing he is *not* honest and noble about is taking credit
for Bernie in the first place.); The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; I suppose if I were going to rate it, I would give it a +3 on
a -5 to +5 scale."
54007.0,Star Kid,1998.0,"The themes are all in place, and
the simple fact is that it's a pleasant little film.; Even when enclosed in his powerful new
Cyborsuit, he has his fears but he learns to overcome them.; He
called it ""an especially good movie"" and gave it ****.; The beauty of Mazzello's performance is that you can
vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes
after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget.; STAR KID stands out as that rare kids'
film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative.","Although there's nothing in STAR KID 
that's likely to be mistaken for modern-day Shakespeare, surprisingly 
few of the lines are cringingly awful.; ThE 1987 GREAT EXPECTATIONS ---THE
UNTOLD STORY was the worst of all.; Opinion:
The bad news is that for an adult this film would be totally
predictable, and the fight scene at the end would be ten minutes too
long.; As screenwriter Glazer did not want to do a literal remake of the
novel (Then why use the book's name?; However, while 
the basic plot is a retread, at least the dialogue transcends the level 
of nonstop, predictable clichés."
54400.0,"Wax, or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees",1991.0,"I thought it was great, but would only recommend it to people with
an appetite for the surreal and the symbolic.; I was consumed by the imagery
and enlightened by the vision of the film and the mastery with which it
was executed.; I'll use the terms I'm familiar with to describe the movie as it
appealed to me, because that's my option.; The story frequently shifts from past
to present to future, from physical reality to the electronic reality of
the bees, and back again.; The story continues as Jacob seeks to accomplish
the task the bees have assigned him....","Director/Writer: David Blair.; However, it's probably too weird for a general audience.; Several people left the theatre
during the film (one man was really angry at having wasted his money on
the film).; Not recommended for a general audience.; I also felt at the end of the film that perhaps a half a
dozen others in the theatre were similarly enthusiastic, and that the
majority were left completely cold."

gunpoint into a car and unwilling to reveal his plans, the gunman is
suddenly overtaken by Hennessy and shot.; Tobin tells him that the cause of a
free Ireland comes above anything else to him.; Therefore, they tell the police

54838.0,Robinson in Space,1989.0,"But it's a 
thought-provoking and very individual film - essentially a documentary 
but one which gently draws us into its own view of life.; 'Robinson in Space' is an off-beat, literary, view of England - with a 
very brief excursion into France and Belgium - through the eyes of two 
men taking part in a curious, enigmatic, survey.; Robinson has a keen eye for the surreal, and for signs of a country no 
longer the industrial power that it once was.; Robinson is preoccupied by literary references - especially those to 
Daniel Defoe: presumably the name Robinson is derived from Robinson 
Crusoe.; Coal, once such an important natural resource, is now imported from 
South Africa.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

all of the contempt that the class possesses for clutching
merchants like Hase; and Dovid, a Talmudic scholar who
pursues his lady fair despite countless rejections and widens
his horizons via poetry lessons from the more wordly, more
secular, and unmarried Sarah (Amanda Ryan).; This is the
ambience that many of Isaac Bashevis Singer's characters
could call home, a now-vanished shtetl which, railroad or not,
was doomed to become extinct.; What gives the story its original edge is one particular:
Simon has grown to dislike, even hate his own people, and
with good reason.; In a film of conventional length,
Hopkins manages to depict various types of persons--Anti-
Semites determined literally to burn out the Jews; a kindly
aristocrat more interested in poetry than in business; a
madman who get a chance for fifteen minutes of fame; a
distinguished rabbi (David De Keyser), who fears the steady
attrition of his people; a scholar whose interest in a woman
competes with the Torah for his attention.; In watching ""Simon Magus,"" a
magical picture in more ways than one, people in the
audience who are not Jewish can absorb through writer-
director Ben Hopkins's careful, detailed, thoroughly human
and humane storytelling the entire history of the scapegoating
of the Hebrew people writ small.","Taylor babbles to himself, shakes his body in prayer
frequently during the day, and seems to gain the affectionate
attentions of just one child while being exploited by the local
priest (Ken Dury) and manipulated by the greedy merchant,
Hase.; Anti-Semite: Why the bicycle riders?; Not Rated.; While the specific crimes
attributed to the besieged people in the now-vanished town
and culture of a 19th Century hamlet in Poland's Silesia
include the charge that the bearded community were
prepared to sacrifice a Christian baby for use in the Passover
matzoh, such an excuse scarcely seems necessary given the
dislike, indifference, or patronizing attitudes of the larger,
Christian community toward a group that numbered no more
than twenty in the poverty-stricken mud-slicked expanse.; More rational person:  No, it was the bicycle riders."
54986.0,Chunhyang,1999.0,"Im Kwon Taek's direction is on target not only in
the portrayal of 18th Century Korea with its courtesans,
bureaucrats, and governors with unlimited power, but in his
vignettes of the lovers as they coyly take part in marriage-
night antics, later to become madly in love with each other as
they playfully roll in the hay.; ""Chunhyang,"" Korea's most lavish film ever, looks terrific.; A musical of sorts, Chunhyang emerges as a rare pairing of film with the
ancient Korean operatic tradition of pansori.; Arrogant at first in demanding
that Chunhyang come to him for a meeting, he gives in to
this independent lass by meeting her more than halfway,
charming her into secretly marrying him, and then sadly
leaving her when ordered to do by his father--who has just
been appointed to the king's cabinet.; To you, 
pansori may not be noise.","Featuring extensive sung 
narration in a type of ancient Korean music called pansori, which 
features a male singer whose singing sounds more like screaming, the 
movie can be jarring to untrained ears.; On the other hand, the 
minimal story and acting aren't particularly compelling on their own.; The simple story is effectively told but is interspersed with
musical numbers not only unfamiliar and strange to most of
its targeted audience of cultivated viewers but to my Western
ears downright irritating, unnecessary and shrill.; Did I mention that Im should lose the drummer and Pansori

55145.0,High Art,1999.0,"), is nevertheless totally kickass and amazing.; The very last sequence is the best in the film, and it brings the story
together with all of its themes.; It's not loud and
sentimental, but quiet, subtle, and intelligent.; Her performance isn't quite as compelling, but 
it's still very good.; It features two very strong performances from Ally Sheedy and Radha 
Mitchell, and it's an indie film with a distinct personal feel to it.","Even worse off is Gabriel Mann as Syd's stick-figure boyfriend,
who exists entirely to give Syd someone to argue with.; Distributor: October Films I suppose HIGH ART is as good a name as any for this pretentious 
melodrama, an often-diverting but ultimately pointless attempt to wed 
intellectual twaddle with a soap-opera-ish lesbian romance.; or introduced through the pretentious drivel that the 
characters spout at one another.; Sadly, the rest of Lisa Cholodenko's script -- an inexplicable
award-winner at Sundance -- strands Sheedy's performance in a sea of
cliches and muddled relationships.; The film
just looked too much like the slick magazine it presented in the film;
that it wanted to say something more about Syd's sudden sexual reversal
and about the despair in Lucy's life, but it just couldn't get it out
what it wanted to say, which is why the film became a let down."
55309.0,Vincent & Theo,1999.0,"It seems from Altman's film about the
great artist who was so misunderstood in his own time that, in fact, there
was good reason to misunderstand Vincent Van Gogh.; VINCENT AND THEO concentrates, not surprisingly, on the love/hate
relationship between Vincent and his brother Theo.; A little ungraciously
the film shows Theo's wife as having little but disgust and disregard for
Vincent while historically it was her perseverance that eventually brought
the art of Vincent Van Gogh to the attention of critics.; Roth plays him
as just plain weird and cold with occasional explosions of emotions.; It is
hard to judge which is the more accurate representation, though the earlier
interpretation is by far the more watchable and dramatically interesting.","His
teeth are rotted and discolored through lack of care and his clothing is
tattered.; There is an odd disjointed quality to the script.; In
the next scene he is back at work as if it were just an activity of no
importance that has been dropped from his schedule.; While that is not
wholly inconsistent with what we see in the film, it does seem unlikely
considering her constantly unfriendly attitude toward her brother-in-law--
not surprisingly toward a man who seems to like to take a big mouthful of
wine and then drool it out of his mouth.; He seems to have a passion for smearing himself with paint and
for eating his paints--we see him licking paint at several points in the
film."
55448.0,Money for Nothing,1991.0,"That
this story is true is the hook that kept us watching.; Cusack starts out pretty low key, but
as the burden of dealing with the money (coupled with a lack of sleep)
gets to Joey, the actor brings to the fore a manic quality that makes
the eventual outcome of the Coyle case believable.; For those who live in and around Philadelphia, Joey Coyle is a
local legend--a dockworker who came to be known and loved by a city of
blue-collar toilers who forever root for the underdog (witness their
infatuation with several perennial sub-.500 sports teams).; The film starts with Coyle (John
Cusack) discovering the money, inadvertently dropped off the back of an
armored car, and follows his life for the next few days as he hides
some of the cash, throws some of it away, and tries to launder the
rest.; The fascination is Joey's stupidity and the fact that it was a
true story.","Basically, the problem with this film is that it lacks the
substance to keep it going for one-hundred minutes.; Oh well, it could have been worse.; The problem with MONEY FOR NOTHING isn't the script or the plot,
it is that the acting by Cusack, Debi Mazar, Michael Madsen, and
Benicio Del Toro and the directing by Ramon Menendez which was all
plodding.; These sad, off-screen
events make an unimpressive film seem even flatter.; The result is probably no better--or worse--than most
prospective viewers would expect."
55457.0,I Wanna Hold Your Hand,1998.0,"The soundtrack
consists of glorious, original Beatles songs, contemporary
with those available to fans in Feb. 1964.; There is an
Ed Sullivan impersonator (Will Jordan), but his Sullivan
schtick is perfect.; The authenticity is impressive.; This is appropriate, since the film is about the
wave of Beatlemania sweeping America in February
1964.; But a happy ending
is in store for all concerned.","Selfish Grace makes an unlikely
career sacrifice for the sake of dweeby Larry.; Wide-eyed bride-to-be Pam (Nancy Allen) wants some
equivalent of a wedding shower, brash Rosie (Wendie Jo

fans, Larry (Marc McClure) is hoping to score with
ambitious photographer Grace (Theresa Saldana), while
folkie Janis (Susan Kendall Newman) and greaser Tony

motivations, and poor effects.; Anyway, the special effects, if
that is what you spend $6 to see, are pretty lame and could be reproduced with
a VCR and a 4th-of-July sparkler.; Perhaps if the effects were better, I would
have enjoyed the movie more, but I doubt it.; There are three love interests in this movie,
but, except for the one playing the nun (yes, I said nun), they are
interchangable with fast cars or bizaare gadgets.; This made-for-TV movie is now playing in theaters for $6 and is posing as
a real movie with big screen talents and skills."
55551.0,Lumumba,1960.0,"The screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a
great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of
Lumumba's life.; Oh, there are dangers facing all of us in these parlous times,
but it seems that the less you need a bodyguard, the less you
seem to attract people out to do you in.; This little-known
story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker
Raoul Peck in ""Lumumba.""; Peck focuses his story on familiar material that
strives to give an honest portrayal of Patrice Lumumba, his friend and foes
and the independence movements that gripped Africa in the 50's and 60's.; The actor gives a
convincing, charismatic performance as the multifaceted, politically deft
Patrice Lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force
driving his own ambitions.","Jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the

55561.0,Clockwatchers,1997.0,"Thanks to the smart, perceptive screenplay, also written by Sprecher, 
and the performances by all four leads, the characters easily were able 
to come alive.; The mystery that surrounds the picture does not feel at all like a 
gimmick, even though it very well could have, and is highly 
unpredictable and surprising, and the final revelation is quiet and 
moving.; That
society can be repressive and authoritarian, is still true today, as
this film encourages you to see and think about what has really changed
after all the Women's Lib Movement agendas and all the other changes in
the workplace that have been accomplished, especially for women, and if
these changes have really made life better for them.; ""Clockwatchers"" is a jewel of a film, and it was so refreshing to watch 
the characters and their various interactions with each other that I 
totally got caught up in it.; Anyway, ""Clockwatchers"" is a good movie, very funny in parts.","The last 30 to 40 
minutes, which emphasize the kleptomaniac subplot, mark the least 
successful portion of the film.; What should have been a passing plot
point changes the focus of the movie, which begins to lose its
comic good will.; Lisa Kudrow plays Paula 
according to type  a ditzy blond lacking a real direction in her life.; (For an opportunity to see Kudrow do something completely different, 
check her out in THE OPPOSITE OF SEX.); The details are 
precise; if there's one area where the movie falls short, it's that the 
plot becomes a little farfetched during the second half."
55730.0,My New Gun,1997.0,"In
today's world, where people buy guns and bring them into their homes
with about as much thought as they buy a toaster, it's refreshing to
see a movie take a closer look, no matter how absurd, at the issue.; Taken on its own without the unspectacular ending, the first part
of MY NEW GUN is brilliant.; Diane Lane, whose list of credits continues to grow
more fascinating and diverse with every new film, is especially
noteworthy.; There are scenes that are
incisive precisely because they're so close to reality.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","Whatever the case, MY NEW GUN loses a lot in its last forty-five
minutes.; LeGros' Skippy is supposed to be a
charismatic figure, but it's difficult determining what Debbie sees in
him.; Or maybe she
simply ran out of ideas for the satirical parts of the script.; I don't know why writer/director Stacy Cochran changed the
direction of the film the way she did.; James LeGros is merely okay--his role demands more than
he seems willing to give."
55731.0,Race the Sun,1997.0,"The scenery is quite nice, and, as
honest happy endings go, any non-violent film that causes an audience of

trauma develop a dark sense of humor, it doesn't ever seem realistic... and
seeming realistic is what dramas are about.; Alive is a good drama, uplifting, hopeful, and intelligent.; Alive is a movie able to touch your heart (and your stomach) as it grimly
displays the miraculous true story of survival in the Andes.; The nature of the story provides dramatic tension, and the
setting (the Andes mountains) provides superb cinematography.; ""Alive"" is one of the best disaster films ever made.","Also, the movie tries to be funny.; Because all of these were Alive rips, Alive now appears to
be contrived and cliched.; The movie has been parodied way too much for something of
its caliber.; Understand me, I have seen about five bad movies in a row, and, when I
watched Alive, I broke my streak.; True story or no, I
have trouble believing that anyone would say half the lines in this movie."
55955.0,My Son the Fanatic,1998.0,"Highly recommended.; And
how intriguing a good, sincere, solid and well-developed film
can put dramatic and comic touches alike on these themes.; Om Puri brings a lot
of emotion to his role as the torn father; while bit players Rachel
Griffiths and Stellan Skarsgard seem merely competent in his
presence.; Acclaimed Indian actor Om Puri (""Gandhi,"" ""City of Joy"") is
superb and utterly convincing as a Scotch-drinking, cricket-loving,
jazz enthusiast who has spent 25 years driving a taxi in industrial
Bradford, England.; In
contrast, Puri gives an exceptional performance as Parvez.","It is good to have such tolerant beliefs, don't get me wrong, but to
make such a boring and muddled picture about it, is not a good thing.; But the filmmaker doesn't even attempt to play fair, the story is told
totally from his point of view, all the others around him are
one-dimensional characters, who are not only uninteresting but they are
for the most part made to appear annoying.; This very predictable social drama will have every character be a
walking cliché, every major event be a contrived one, and it will do
everything it could do to convince the audience that assimilation is the
way to go, but get out on the pulpit and preach against racial hatred.; The filmmaker is all over the cricket field with these
problems, but just can't make this long list of problems have any
lasting interest for the film goer.; But while the film's
conflict is a relevant one, the film itself is poorly wrought."

determination does not.; Yost offers information about Lynne and Reese

Organisation.; Overshadowed by the lead or not, supporting cast is splendid
- John Vernon played the first of his many villainous roles,
James Sikking is great as cynical hitman, as well as Lloyd
Bochner and Carroll O'Connor as corporate gangsters.; His acting is very subtle, and the
emotional states of Walker are presented through small
gestures, short glances or cold, impersonal action.; On the other
hand, the viewers are still focused thanks to excellent
cast.","In some instances the events on the
screen are unclear, characters act irrationally and film
even lacks the proper closure, leaving the audience without
expected catharsis.; Boorman even makes more confusion with
some surreal shots, hinting that the whole film could be
nothing more than a fantasy of a dying Walker.; Heavy atmosphere and style of POINT BLANK compensated the
simplicity of the script, but Boorman, unfortunately,
overplayed that card.; The plot of the original film is based on THE HUNTER, 1964

fake backgrounds used in the 12th century scenes.; ], at

accumulation of them and not enough good stuff to compensate for the 
bad.; The featherweight plot lacks an urgency

56830.0,Johns,1999.0,"This dream leads to a
surprisingly touching moment involving the hotel's desk clerk (Richard
Kind), one of several sparkling scenes Silver gives to his supporting
characters; another clever bit finds Jimmy the Warlock becoming a bit less
menacing as he struggles with basic subtraction.; JOHNS is a frequently shocking, intensely real, and always
poignant look at the lives of young hustlers.; Richard Kind takes what
has all of the markings of being the most cliched part in the film and
gives Paul great warmth and compassion.; The most compelling performance is turned in by Lukas Haas 
(EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU), whose sincerity and optimism as Donner is 
heartbreaking.; Although far from perfect, ""johns,"" is an edgy and powerful motion 
picture.","Instead, what we get 
is a modern-day version of a Greek tragedy with some unnecessarily 
intrusive and irritatingly obvious religious symbolism thrown in for 
good measure.; As simply a study of male 
prostitution, then it is fine, but after the end credits started to 
roll, it just didn't feel like it had much of a point, except that this 
underground business that isn't very well known, is meaningless and 
leads nowhere.; Apparently the subject of street
hustling is particularly conducive to sending directors into fits of
artistic incontinence.; It isn't enough that we realize John's
birthday is Christmas day; John also gets a chain whipped across his
forehead so he looks like he has been wearing a crown of thorns.; Director:  Scott Silver."

well written storyline, Orphans is easily one of the best films I've
seen in a long time.; The
tone varies radically as well -- I don't know what twisted flight of
writer/director Peter Mullan's fancy inspired Michael's run-in with an
ill-tempered pub owner -- but on balance the stronger segments and the
solid performances make ORPHANS well worth watching.; With vivid clarity, this is an amazing
portrayal of a family in obvious turmoil.; While some may lose patience with the buildup, the
payoff is ultimately worth it.; An impressive feature debut by Scottish director Peter Mullan (best
known for a role in Trainspotting), Orphans tells the tale of each
individual character as they try to make their way to their mother's
funeral the next morning.","John (Stephen McCole) looks
to a psychotic friend for a gun and bullets--they share a tortuous scene
that recalls the rape in ""A Clockwork Orange"" without the Ludwig Van.; On
the other hand, they can be undercut by techical ineptitude (fuzzy white
text that gets lost in white backgrounds) or linguistic laziness (opting
to translate only about every fourth word).; On the one hand, they're infinitely
preferable to wretched dubbing that sucks the life out of performances.; --| E-mail address altered to avoid unsolicited junkmail.; The crude language in the film, too, is as constant and

his stubborness, and his preference of leadership to
romance.; Her character has plenty
of motivation for obsessively pursuing Clift:
he is after all a land baron, and has saved her
life from marauding indians.; When the American Film Institute released their
list of the 100 greatest American films, the most
glaring omission was ""Red River"".","The stampede

some 600 head are said to be lost in the entire

draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family.; In short his final film is one of his best in years.","Don't skip this one.; If they had
stuck to the family and its problems, this could have been an ORDINARY

velJohnson, and Roddy Piper as Alexander Godunov.; Change L.A. into Toronto.","But Tweed is supposed to be a kickboxing champ, so nothing
matters at this point.; I seriously doubt anyone
will care that Tweed (well, actually a horrible body double filmed as far
away from the camera as possible) is kicking the bad guys in the groin.; ""No Contest"" is a VERY blatent rip-off of ""Die Hard"", just on a much lower
level of intelligence, credibility, and creativity.; Well, she
doesn't even get naked in this one, and really, 99% of the people who rent
Shannon Tweed movies are only after that one thing.; They apparently are trying to kidnap a
congressman's daughter who is participating in the pagent."
57918.0,Big,1998.0,"Marshall, by cutting away just after Susan
takes off her blouse and Josh touches her with childlike innocence,
manages to keep the show's PG rating and give the scene incredible but
simple beauty.; In BIG Hanks
gives one of the best performances of his impressive career.; As the noise of the
city's terrors filter into his room, he lies on the bed gently sobbing
as he grips his pillow.; His most moving scene in the show
occurs as he lays alone in a NYC fleabag hotel.; Then the realism
dissolves as he enters the business world and finds his winning, boyish ways
open doors for him.","Instead we have a 13-year-old suddenly finding himself
about twice that age.; When the inevitable
scene occurs in which the full grown Josh reverts back to his teenage
body, she cuts away from a rear view of Tom Hanks back and then returns
to David Moscow, who is seen walking away in a suit several sizes too
large.; Previous versions of the idea have children in older
bodies trying to seem normal and failing miserably or at least humorously.; When the machine just spit out a
card stating, ""Your wish is granted,"" he was not impressed.; Every once in a while the Law of Averages works especially well or
poorly for filmmakers."
58102.0,Some Mother's Son,1994.0,"Her Kathleen has a touching diffidence, a surprising
naivete, and great quiet courage.; Both actresses are well cast and give marvelous performances.; I recommend this excellent film to
you and give it ***.; Bill Whelan's forceful, energetic score is one of the best of the year.; The real star of the film, however, is Helen Mirren, who gives a 
stirring performance as Gerard's torn mother, Kathleen.","Margaret Thatcher's mouthpiece is a caricature of vicious, heartless 
cliches.; It is rated R for scenes of people
starving to death, for some violence, and for profanity.; Flanagan, whose
character undergoes no political changes throughout the film, has
ostensibly less to work with.; With the exception of a single scene,
SOME MOTHER'S SON makes the death of the British appear as remote and
painless as shooting targets in a video game.; As such,
his character is as implacable as that of his British anti-terrorist
counterpart -- and that of Sister Bernardina's, to boot."
58200.0,Shadowzone,1997.0,"The
actors/actresses all do a great job however, which makes the movie all
that more enjoyable.; For me it is a bit
hard to accept the fact that a dream dimension can send material objects
into the real world (although the film somewhat covers that aspect).; I recommend this film to people who
liked the ALIEN series.; SHADOWZONE is a rather well done horror film,
that has some slight problems.; For the most part the characters were well written.","The biggest problem with SHADOWZONE is that,
although it seems to try hard to be original, it looks to me like a
rip-off of ALIEN.; For a smart
scientist, he seems to do some rather stupid things.; They should have worked harder on the ending.; The person who
I think the writers goofed with was James Hong's character.; All of them are
stuck under the ground while the monster slaughters them."
58467.0,Girl,1999.0,"The film is essentially a journey - Andrea must find her real self, 
as she becomes a woman.; Andrea 
soon becomes obsessed with Todd and becomes what she had previously 
despised - a groupie.; Andrea latches onto 
this group, since it brings her into contact with Todd.; Her only concern, shared with her best friend,
Darcy, is when she will 'become a woman' (i.e.; Feeling that she needs more 'life' experience, she heads
to a seedy part of town, where she encounters the lead singer of a
local underground band, Todd Sparrow (Sean Patrick
Flanery).","Unfortunately, 
despite slavishly copying bits of each of those productions, the 
result is a trite and boring teen flick.; However, those scenes are too few, and are not 
enough to save a movie, which feels like a very bad episode of 
Beverly Hills 90120.; At the end of
every episode, Gary would sign off portentously with a bit of
philosophy which was invariably inane, stating something so blindingly
obvious that it served only to illuminate why he was working the
graveyard shift.; What finally sinks the movie is the last twenty minutes, when the 
film attempts to become a serious teen drama and fails miserably.; It was a mistake to use the music scene as a
backdrop, too."
58680.0,Woo,1998.0,"Beautiful and smart, she's also a handful...so much so that her cousin
Claudette (Paula Jai Parker), with whom she's staying, schemes to get
her out of the apartment for one night.; You'd think you'd get the
best of both films.; It's not love at first 
sight, however.; As in 
all romantic comedies, we know from the beginning that Woo and Tim are 
going to end up together.; They have a terrific rapport, and Davidson's hilariously
high-strung, put-upon straight man manages to upstage the sexy spunk of
Pinkett Smith, who never looks less than gorgeous throughout the entire film.","Boring, uninteresting and pointless, the
film wastes both its talent and your time.; Well, ok...the chicken sex
fetishist was disturbingly bad, but the movie is more bland than
horrible.; Mayer 
(PARTY GIRL), could have been worse than it is.; bad, but it is bad...and not one which I
would recommend to anyone besides an insomniac.; But for the sake of
this bad movie?"
58787.0,Arctic Blue,1998.0,"Also, some of the action scenes
are impressive.; Among all of
them, Ben is caught and accused of murder.; But, in the end, ARCTIC BLUE is a film with
the flaws that outweigh its virtues.; In such wilderness,
adventure is still possible, but also close encounters with
the characters who many of us wouldn't like to see in our
neighbourhoods.; One of such characters is Ben Corbett
(played by Rutger Hauer), hardened trapper who is prone to
violence.","Screenplay by Ross
LaManna is bellow par, with clear story diluted with poorly
written, yet morally ambiguous characters, and also with
unnecessary elements of environmentalist propaganda.; Luckily,
Rutger Hauer, same as in many similar instances lately,
saves this basically forgettable piece of low budget cinema
with his screen personality.; Casting
is also rather bad, especially in the case of awfully inept
Rya Kihlstedt in the role of Eric's girlfriend.; Instead, it often baffles audience with shots more
appropriate to experimental video.; For them, Alaska
might have look like a better place to live than Hawaii."
58985.0,Grace of My Heart,1992.0,"Illeanna Douglas gives a captivating performance as Denise and carries
the audience along with her throughout the film with a warm and very
charming performance.; She gives a compelling and
always believable performance.; This is an easy show to watch and to enjoy, and
hence one definitely worth a recommendation.; He is terrific as Denise's ever
domineering boss and mentor, and it is one of my favorite roles of his.; In her first starring role, normally supporting actress, Douglas
is perfectly cast and performs flawlessly.","Just terrible.; Only 
the poor editing of the first half, where Anders compresses time 
to a ridiculous extent (in one scene, Anders doesn't even give Edna 
three seconds to walk over and greet a character, instead cutting 
directly to their embrace) and the distressingly commercial finale 
lowers my impression of the film.; Not good in a movie about music.; Dillon's performance is
too sleepy to be involving even as Jay becomes more and more paranoid and
depressed, and we are left to watch him play the way Wilson might have
been without understanding why we should care.; They're background elements that are given cursory screen time only when 
they impact upon the main story."
59138.0,Modulations,1998.0,"Electronic music is with us and
most of us eavesdrop on it consciously or not.; It creates a mood.; Remember: ALL
sound is music.; As Alvin
Toffler, author of ""Future Shock"" and one of the few older
chaps in the movie states, ""We in the West are good at taking
things apart: what we're not so good at is putting things
together.""; We hear from representatives in Berlin,
London, Detroit, Tokyo, and Mount Fuji, each putting in his or
her two cents, yen, marks or tuppence about scores of
minutely distinct types of electronic music: tri-hop, acid house,
drum-and-bass, and ambient music are just some kinds of
new music, with ambient the type almost everyone in the
audience can accept.","The movie could have been much improved if Iara Lee
would have slowed down, knocked out some of the verbally
inarticulate commentators (like, I mean, you know), and given
a conventially topical arrangement to this frenzied mlange of
sound, light, and imagery.; If structure is important, it's a flop.; If you're a movie buff, you listened to
strains of an electronic composition by the fictional character
Vinh Schuman, in the movie ""Bad Manners.""; If an education is your goal, it's OK
for a start.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

59569.0,Killer: A Journal of Murder,1995.0,"The film tells in flashback the story of Carl's past
life intertwined with his current predicament.; In a true story set in the Leavenworth federal penitentiary in
1929, the great and explosive actor James Woods plays Carl Panzram.; Perhaps the best sequence in the show is when Carl is at a prison
earlier in his career when a reform minded warden comes in to whom the
inmates give the nickname of Spud.; If you can focus on the story itself and
ignore the plodding pacing, at its heart KILLER: A JOURNAL OF MURDER is
a fascinating tale.; For more reviews, check out JERRY AT THE MOVIES at

rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","Director Tim Metcalfe has no idea how to steer such unpleasant material so he
takes the Peckinpah approach: he throws everything up in the air without
sorting any of the details or characters (Metcalfe dedicates the film to Sam
Peckinpah).; ""Killer"" is ambiguous, dull, and uninteresting; the narrative structure is so
sloppily fragmented that it will give you a migraine.; ""Killer: A Journal of Murder"" is a laborious, clear-studied case in excess: it
is relentlessly overdone with bad acting, bad direction, and laughably
pretentious dialogue to boot.; All I could keep asking myself was: why did
Oliver Stone serve as one of the executive producers of this junk?; Anything's better than this tripe."
59585.0,Immediate Family,1998.0,"IMMEDIATE FAMILY captures your heart, but only after fighting off
several flaws.; Yes, even stranger than the hair pieces in STAR TREK V.  Brace
yourselves for a shock: for the first time in his film career, James Woods
plays a sensitive, all-around nice guy.; The good news is that director Jonathan Kaplan has elicited
memorable performances from his leads.; With his
warm performance, Woods has broken the mold and virtually reinvented his
on-screen persona.; Woods stars opposite Glenn Close; together, they play a loving
husband and wife who can't conceive.","Third, the movie is utterly predictable; the ""big surprises""
are anything but surprising.; Second,
the lovey-dovey relationships are too much to take: it's like being trapped
in an elevator with someone who reeks of perfume.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

59711.0,Comfort and Joy,1990.0,"This incident has a strong impact on Alan.; She 
smiles at him, and he follows the truck with his car.; He is so coy about this that his radio boss thinks he's lost it,
sends Alan to a shrink, and takes him off the air.; Apparently, Alan's boss is pleased as
well, since Alan returns to the airwaves to plug his new 
product on his show as the credits roll.; But, eventually,
Alan comes up with a solution.","The pace is too slow, and the various characters
that are supposed to be humorous are not.; The soundtrack is as tame and lame
as Alan's on-air music.; The McCool's are of Italian heritage, which
apparently makes them act like mobsters, a stereotype complete
with the head speaking Italian and the son translating and
talking about family honor.; But perhaps the biggest mistake is
the attempt to present violence and vandalism as something
amusing.; Mr. Bunny has employed an attractive
daughter of the McCool's."

pushing her knees back and forth in order to simulate her undulating in 
sexual heat."
60041.0,White Mischief,1993.0,"It was one of my favorite shorts, and is a real treat for any movie lover.; Here, the war is incredibly distant; there are no
shortages and most people are living decadently, if not hedonistically.; By the end of
the film, the events of the film have driven the young wife almost around the
bend.; The rest of the film deals with the aftermath of the murder
and the revelation of who the murderer is.; Things escalate to an court trial, then
resolution of the major crises that have been raised.","Everybody seems to meet
some sort of ""that's where your lifestyle takes you"" demon, not entirely unlike
BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY.; The resolution is not particularly
satisfying, nor does it make much sense; but that's not the appeal of the film.; The film would almost fit into the proper British mysteries of Tey, Christie
and the like, but there really are no sympathetic characters.; WHITE MISCHIEF's greatest appeal is to put a series of veteran British
actors before the camera in rather bizarre roles, and give them witty lines to
deliver for 90 minutes.; Seems to add extra symbolism to the end."
60270.0,Wish You Were Here,1957.0,"Both were great.; The movie ends with her
making some very crucial decisions about how she will live her life.; But as she realizes what her actions have done, she begins to
realize the consequences that she must begin to face.; It is directed and
written by David Leland, the writer of MONA LISA (with Neil Jordan) and
PERSONAL SERVICES.; Her favorite saying (she says it often) is ""up
your bum.""","The story is about a young girl who tries to rebel against
her father and society by swearing like a truck driver and using sexual
promiscuity to shock people.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

60276.0,Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills,1994.0,"Miriam Nadel
mhnadel@gryphon.COM !gryphon!mhnadel   nadel@aspen.aero.org The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; I went to see this SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS for
pretty much the same reason that everyone else who's seen it did -- I thought
Paul Bartel's EATING RAOUL was hysterically funny and was looking forward to
more of the same.; However, Bartel seems
to have had trouble remembering that comedy is most effective when it is
unpredictable.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Rounding out the cast are a diet doctor (played by
Bartel), the divorcee's crippled son who has the hots for Claire's daughter but
is willing to settle for his new aunt, an Aztec housekeeper, with a penchant
for dire predictions involving jaguars tearing people apart, and the ghost of
Claire's husband who is trying to keep his marriage alive, even if he isn't.; Unfortunately, the operative word in the title is ""scenes.""; Wait for a bargain matinee or, even better,
a videotape so you can fast-forward over the parts which plod.; The plot is basically one of everyone trying to sleep with everyone else.; Some individual scenes are very funny but the movie as a whole would have
benefited from judicious editing -- including the removal of at least two of the
numerous subplots."
60855.0,Double Happiness,1998.0,"This is truly a wonderful motion picture, and an unexpected 
find.; Jade, as played by actress Sandra Oh, is a wonderful character:  
likable, bubbly, optimistic, funny, and -- most important of all -- 
believable.; Like many of the best comedies, this one is funny because it deals 
with the realities of life and the human condition -- circumstances and 
situations that everyone can relate to, regardless of ethnic heritage.; What Mina Shum has achieved here is impressive for a first-time 
film maker.; The comic tone of DOUBLE HAPPINESS has a unique flavor.","Unfortunately, this is just icing on a poorly
cooked cake.; The sad bottom line is that DOUBLE HAPPINESS is simply unnecessary
and isn't even uplifting, as it was intended.; The sad thing is, it could have been a good movie.; Also, the movie's supposed to be a comedy/drama (I think), but
a number of opportunities to infuse some much-needed humor are missed.; Unfortunately,
bad acting on a general level really hampers the film, especially during
the melodrama of the family struggle, where everything seems almost
farcical."
60994.0,Guinevere,1993.0,"Here, Polley immediately zeroes on Harper's insecurities and
quiet fears and brings them delicately to the surface.; In the
end, `Guinevere' does falter, but it does so beautifully.; This is a movie packed with strong character development and 
great scenes.; As
she transforms from a shy, antisocial individual who despite
her beauty may never have had a boy friend to a romantically
fulfilled and professionally competent human being, she is in
turning contributing a great deal of gratification to the roue
who has taken her in and given her a life.; Wells also jackets the film in a variety of moods, most striking
in the concluding moments when she converts Connie's
studio into a surreal vision of heavenly light.","It was very difficult to watch these talented performers saying all this
soap opera mush, which trivialized what could have been an interesting
film about a woman learning to become a woman through sex, if in the
hands of a more capable director/screenwriter.; ""You take pictures when it hurts so bad you can't stand it
any more,"" he instructs her -- an example of the film's typically
stilted dialog.; The result is a
film that is as dull as dishwater.; While
it's hard to take an aspiring photographer-who-never-takes-a-picture
seriously, the conclusion, which contrives to reunite the Guineveres,
seems too fanciful and out of context.; GUINEVERE, except for a few
random scenes that are sharply written, quickly becomes tedious."
61416.0,Beautiful People,1999.0,"_Beautiful_People_ is indeed a beautiful film, one that is
thought-provoking and moving while always remaining entertaining.; There are moments of
sadness and shocking brutality, but there are just as many more comic
moments, in particular Griffin's hilariously unpredictable yet strangely
moving thread.; Like most first films, `Beautiful People', which won
Best Picture at the Cannes Film Festival, is a bit
rough around the edges.; It is also about the need for the Bosnian immigrant to let go of his
past and reinvent himself when living in England.; Two men who knew
each other in the old country--one a Serb (Dado Jehan), the other a Croat
(Faruk Pruti)--meet by chance on a bus and then proceed to beat the
living daylights out of each other, landing themselves in the hospital.","What it fails to do is tell a coherent
story, as everything about this exaggerated tale is hopelessly lost in a
sea of silliness.; It's a tedious film that isn't saved by its moral
ambitions.; BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE (director/writer: Jasmin Dizdar; cinematographer: Barry
Ackroyd; editor: Justin Krish; cast: Charlotte Coleman (Portia
Thornton), Charles Kay (George Thornton), Rosalind Ayres (Nora
Thornton), Roger Sloman (Roger Midge), Heather Tobias (Felicity Midge),
Danny Nussbaum (Griffin Midge), Siobhan Redmond (Kate Higgins), Gilbert
Martin (Jerry Higgins), Steve Sweeney (Jim), Linda Bassett (Nurse),
Nicholas Farrell (Dr. Mouldy), Edin Dzandzanovic (Pero), Dado Jehan
(Serb), Faruk Prutti (Croat), Nicholas McGaughey (Welch Nationalist
Arsonist), 1999-UK) A farcical political drama, done in the manner of a TV spoof.; -- the movie is like an
incoherent story told by an inebriated guest.; There was an attempt to show that besides
speaking the same language and looking alike, the two feuding ethnic
groups have a lot in common."
61807.0,Ethan Frome,1988.0,"Even when you know it is coming, it still takes your breath away.; The feeling is wonderfully heightened by the
presence of a frigid wife and winter; the bleakness of life and love,
forcing these two characters into each other's arms.; Everything about him, from his
mimicking of the injured man's walk to the pained facial expressions in
numerous close-ups, shows how in touch he was with the role he was
playing.; In many ways, the strength of ETHAN FROME comes largely from its
essential simplicity.; The sad and bitter tale set in a bleak but 
lovely countryside has graceful Rachel Portman music to accompany the 
images.","Even though it is free from all
profanity, nudity, and overt sex, ETHAN FROME is not a good family film
because, frankly, those of a younger age will find it dreadfully
boring.; Wharton is renown for her depressing tone and style of
writing, so the morbid finale is at least in keeping with her character.; Zeena is so irritating that even the most 
fervent anti-adulterer will empathize with Ethan's need to abandon her 
and run to Mattie for love and companionship.; The creative team
behind the movie attempted to make Zeena less obviously wicked than she
is in the book.; Even so, the running time
of the movie is no longer than that of an average film, despite the
fact that its content is far from ""average""."
62422.0,Year of the Horse,1995.0,"This is a film of contrasts: black and white; black and
white and color; decades--'76, '86, '96; words, and music.; YEAR OF THE HORSE is such a 
film.; Jarmusch's ""glue"" that holds the picture together is the artier stuff that
Pancho references, wonderfully edited by Jay Rabinowitz: collage-like
snippets of soundstages, motorbikes, and American landscapes flashing by;
adoring nationals, singing Swedes, indecipherable Glaswegians.; The music is
very good and Jarmusch gives us nine full songs, including ""Stupid Girl,""
""Tonight's the Night,"" and the anthem-like ""Like a Hurricane"" that closes
the film.; ""Pure,"" as Young himself puts it.","Unless you worship at the altar of Neil Young, I urge you to avoid 
this film.; Three-
minute songs are dragged out into 10-minute torture sessions.; Unless you're a Neil Young die-hard, 
you're likely to find YEAR OF THE HORSE unbearable.; What it 
turns out to be, however, is an overlong home movie with bad video and 
barely-adequate sound.; While extended jams can be enjoyable in person, where the 
audience forges a rapport with the band, they make for terrible 
cinematic material, and, coupled with Jarmusch's shaky, muddy 
photography (accomplished primarily with a hand-held Super 8 camera), 
they become lifeless, tedious exercises in chord repetition."
62488.0,Destiny Turns on the Radio,1985.0,"Although it is wild and quirky, occasionally to excess, it
is also surprisingly entertaining and grounded in real emotion by an
exceptional performance from Nancy Travis.; DESTINY TURNS ON THE RADIO is aimed at those with
a taste for the surreal, but it also has a very real heart which
makes it more than the sum of its parts.; Dylan McDermott and James LeGros play off each
other well as the two thieves, each with his own ideas about the
strange events of the story, and Jim Belushi is both comic and
menacing as the big shot with a penchant for grabbing is crotch.; Sure, it's unpredictable, but who cares?; In general, I 
appreciate offbeat pictures, but that's when there's something worth 
searching for beneath the surface.","Even the hero Julian is pretty
obnoxious and unlikeable.; Unfortunately, Tarantino's talents are wasted here.; Take away all the weird, 
ultimately pointless mystical mumbo-jumbo and you're left with a story 
that makes very little sense.; But for 100 or so minutes
the movie drones on and on about a bunch of characters we don't seem to
care about or particularly like.; In an attempt to make this a hip,
ultra-cool ""magical comedy,"" the result is simply pure nonsense."
62568.0,Angel Heart,1999.0,"Angel follows a trail that has been cold for twelve years through
Harlem, Poughkeepsie, Coney Island, and soon to New Orleans.; But through the course of the film, it becomes clear that
not everything is exactly what it seems, as Angel is pulled into the dark
world of New Orleans and all that inhabits.; But not only is that opening shot a marvel of cinematography and lighting,
but it also sets up the mood for what is to follow.; Harry will
trigger a series of murders of friends of Favorite and will become the prime
suspect in some of these murders before he discovers the secret of the
disappearance of Favorite.; Technically, the scene is flawless.","Each
somehow looks equally ridiculous.; Strangely, though, it never comes
across as a rip-off in any way, nor does it seem to be a gimmicky homage.; Arguing what an R-rated film should be and what can only be in a
X-rated film is like arguing how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.; Oh, and as for the film having to have ten seconds of Mickey Rourke
shaking his buttocks edited out in order to go from an X to an R rating--who
cares?; But, sadly, the allusion to Brando
turned out to be all too accurate; much like the Godfather of film, he has
now drifted into obscurity."
62676.0,Limbo,1978.0,"Highly recommended.; This is very watchable: Strathairn, Mastrantonio and Martinez are intense 
performers, and the cinematographer, Haskell Wexler, is a fascinating mixer 
of realistic brightness and rich colours.; His most expensive film to date (with a budget of $8 million), Limbo
is a subtle, yet intelligent and sedately paced character study that
explores themes of isolation, survival and redemption.; This film is very good.; ""Limbo"" is John Sayles' most unflinching,
daringly original, and powerfully disturbing film, and Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio's performance of bruising, heart-wrenching intensity is
definitely Oscar-caliber.","Sayles is a hack of the worst sort.; It's a disappointment
because he tries to say too much.; On the other hand, it's basically a movie featuring an
Alaskan fisherman who falls for an over-the-hill folkie singer with a messed
up daughter, that runs a little over 125 minutes, moves at a slow pace, and
might have many people screaming ""foul"" after its anti-Hollywood ending.; I walked a
half-mile in the rain and sat through two hours of typical, plodding
Sayles melodrama to get cheated by a complete and total copout finale.; I suppose you could see the second half as Sayles' attempt to show
just how far civilization has to go, if you were feeling particularly
generous."
62677.0,Songcatcher,1997.0,"While in the mountains, Lily makes an incredible discovery for a musicologist
like herself.; In
Maggie Greenwald's exquisitely sensitive and sincere film
""Songcatcher,"" the title character laments the fact that people
today may read the words to the songs,  but what good are mere
statements without the music that makes them soar?; On the Granger Movie Gauge of
1 to 10, ""Songcatcher"" is an intelligent, extraordinary 8, transported by the
transcendent power of song.; Taking up
residence in a snug wooden cabin with her schoolteacher sister
Elna (Jane Adams), she is well on her way to writing her book
when she hears the words to several ballads beautifully performed
by a teenage girl, Deladis Slocumb (Emmy Rossum).; The music is good.","""Educating these savages is a waste of money,"" he says.; But the story,
the writing, and the direction are a travesty.; Writer/director Maggie
Greenwald tries to pack too much feminist dogma into the story, which makes
the whole thing seem like a heavy-handed message film.; I was hoping that at some point in the 109 minute picture, Lily
would explain why these medieval ballads (which she erroneously
calls ""ancient"") are so bloody in contrast to the purely romantic
songs of, say, the U.S. during the 1950's as performed on TV in
""Your Hit Parade.""; In one of these clichéd moments, Ambrose
McFarland (Steve Boles), the wealthy head of the coal company, which is trying
to buy the land for fifty cents an acre, doesn't believe in the importance of
Elna's school."
62728.0,Brighton Rock,1992.0,"This cynical ending is perfect.; It has a raw power in it that a noir film
commands when the dark side of human nature unfolds so suddenly
onscreen, even if the scene was changed from the one in Greene's novel.; It was a brassy portrayal
that detracted from the noir mood of the film.; Richard Attenborough's
manic performace as a psychopathic, androgynous character, who had
violent mood swings, was pulsatingly brilliant.; BRIGHTON ROCK (director: John Boulting; screenwriters: from the novel
Brighton Rock by Graham Greene/Graham Greene/Terence Rattigan;
cinematographer: Harry Waxman; cast: Richard Attenborough (Pinkie
Brown), William Hartnell (Dallow), Carol Marsh (Rose Brown), Hermione
Baddeley (Ida Arnold), Wylie Watson (Spicer), Harcourt Williams

Goldner (Colleoni), George Carney (Phil Corkey), Nigel Stock (Cubitt),
Alan Wheatley (Kolley Kibber), Harry Ross (Brewer), Victoria Winter
(Judy), 1947-GB) Possibly the best British noir film ever made, a film adapted from the
Graham Greene novel.","The film
turns into a suspension between melodrama and farce, as Ida becomes the
amateur detective, visiting Prewitt's chaotic office, where from next
door there is heard loud music drowning out her conversation with him,
as she futilely tries to convince him to turn Pinkie in for the two
murders.; But the film
was a failure at the box office.; The tourist bureau was so afraid that this gloomy look at
Brighton would scare off tourists, that the film opens with a ""crawl""
telling what a safe and jolly playground community Brighton now is.; The only weakness in the film was the awkward pacing of the story and
the over inflated role of Hermione Baddeley.; At the lair of the 17-year-old Pinkie's mob, are his older henchmen, who
tell him that an unimportant journalist Kolley Kibber 'alias' Fred Hale
(Wheatley) is visiting Brighton."
62976.0,What Women Want,1989.0,"One simple rendezvous
carries a sweet, romantic wistfulness within the perfect backdrop of a
small booth at an elegant jazz club.; In fact, this movie provides plenty of hysterical moments.; I'm pleased 
that after so many wonderful supporting performances, Cheadle has gotten 
name-above-the-title recognition with this film.; Especially compelling is Javier's plight.; It's a very,
very ""surface"" kind of movie...with lots of songs packed into its
best-selling soundtrack-to-be.","The result is a 
promising core let down by hopelessly routine execution, a movie which 
could have been a superior comedy but instead will likely fade quickly 
from the collective memory.; Tomei is appealing, if badly treated by the script.; She could be one of the worst actors in Hollywood.; One, in which delinquent 
dad Nick tries to make up for lost time with his daughter (Ashley 
Johnson), is amusing if rather predictable.; Nick expects to be promoted to
creative director, but his boss (Alan Alda) instead opts to bring in Darcy
Maguire (Helen Hunt) to provide the sensitivity to women's concerns Nick
clearly lacks."
62994.0,Dog Park,1979.0,"The dogs may be in obedience school (and some of the comedic highlights
come from their instructor who firmly believes dogs are better than 
children) but it's the owners who need training.; Another, seemingly perfect, couple have two dogs.; He
takes his job with deadly seriousness.; - Some of the best humor is from the absurdity of the dog
     psychologist played by ""Kids in the Hall"" alumni Mark McKinney.; - Janeane Garofalo plays a friend of Andy, part of a ""perfect
     couple.""","And yet it happened here, when two of the worst films to grace the
silver screen have been star-crossed in this conflagration of irony.; Too bad the
actors, in this imitation of a bad sitcom pilot, couldn't get their
names removed from the credits.; ""Dog Park"" is so
feather-light that it's as forgettable as yesterday's main
squeeze.; In the few, the
very few, times the movie approaches even mildly cute, the director
kills the moment, almost as if he were trying to keep the movie from
being funny.; In
fact, you could probably write a better script from this premise than
McCulloch did."
63076.0,Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam,1998.0,"Nick arrives in Hollywood just in time to find out that he will
not be able to interview Heidi for two months since she is being put by
the courts into a mandatory drug rehab program.; He, as
are most of the others, are into both drugs and prostitution, but Ivan
is a smooth operator who hides his evil.; The film concentrates on two despicable characters in Heidi's
life.; As readers of my reviews have long since learned, my favorite
movie genre is the documentary.; Opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's.","He does not stop a
minute and instead interviews whomever he can find no matter how
unimportant and boring.; In a movie populated by boring sleasebags and done by a
self-serving documentarian, there is a single good scene.; Well I am sorry to
report that narcissistic director Nick Broomfield found an outfit
called InPictures to distribute HEIDI FLEISS: THE HOLLYWOOD MADAM.; Simply put, this is the worst documentary I have ever seen.; The film is not
rated, but would certainly get an R for bad language, some sex, and
some nudity."
63437.0,Telling Lies in America,1997.0,"Kevin Bacon, as the smooth-talking, slick-as-oil DJ, is 
fantastic.; ""Telling Lies in America"" is a heartwarming story which,
while offering nothing particularly new to the classic formula of
its genre, is boosted by remarkable performances from its
principals, particularly by Kevin Bacon in the role of a cynical,
hip disc jockey whose radio station WHK.; Although far from an outstanding film, the people in it
will touch your heart.; Renfro's 
portrayal rings true, and his scenes with Bacon mark TELLING LIES' best 
moments.; Brad Renfro, 
who got his start in THE CLIENT before appearing opposite Bacon in 
SLEEPERS, holds his own as the shy, ostracized Karchy -- a lonely 
teenager who is trying to find meaning and acceptance in life.","Why does he need to do this?; It's a sincere-yet-uninspired diversion, and not even two 
strong performances can elevate it to a higher level.; While the 17-year-old Karchy Jonas (Brad
Renfro), the character meant to represent Eszterhas, shows
no particular talent or inclination to become a writer, he
possesses one great gift that would help him to become a
storyteller: he lies and lies and lies.; Indeed, some of the vignettes have the ring 
of authenticity, but the overall plot is disappointingly generic.; TELLING LIES is simple, low-key, and, sadly, banal."

Mr. Brown's Movie Site: http://welcome.to/mrbrown
CompuServe Hollywood Hotline: http://www.HollywoodHotline.com The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Turns out Robin still pines
for his high school sweetheart Lise (Brooke Langton), who has long gone on
with her life, and Hughes's main concern at long last reveals itself as a
tired ""live in the present and for the future"" message.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Also added to the pointless
proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving Quinn's
dimwitted deputy Ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex
with his girlfriend Donna (Karen Sillas).; I'm
not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words
bear little resemblance to the slow, completely uninvolving bore I saw--at
least, it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film.; Such a glorified
workshop may have its rewards for the actors, but it leaves audiences with
a booby prize.; Wide awake, however, is the
cast, who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy
and skill--thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless
enterprise: to serve as a series of acting exercises.; Police sergeant Phil Quinn (William Sadler) takes him in, and what
ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and
sneak-ins where Robin slips out of his jail cell, breaks a window, then
returns, all without Quinn ever noticing."
64039.0,Only You,2001.0,"Then Damon makes an admission
about himself that will change their relationship entirely that will
change Faith's mind about him.; Despite some underlying ideas about forging
one's own destiny, this is a essentially a light, inoffensive movie
that will appeal to those who aren't seeking more than a bubbly
romance.; This is another love story about fate (remember SLEEPLESS IN
SEATTLE?; The casting of Tomei was absolutely perfect.; There they meet Peter, a shoe salesman,  who pretends that he is
Bradley ... and the fun really starts with many twists and turns and
one delightful surprise following another.","I found myself particularly intrigued by the Hunt character
although her romance was supposed to be a sideshow.; Many linkages too to older movies, but I am never very
fond of that cinematic technique.; Unfortunately, Tomei and Downey appear less made for each other
than their characters supposedly are.; Or it could be that Marisa Tomei's Faith is so focused
on destiny that she never has an opportunity to develop a personality.; Tomei's energetic
performance merely makes her hyperactively flat."
64218.0,Deathline,2000.0,"Takacs creates an abundance of atmosphere in the milieu of a Russian 
Mafia-dominated underworld - journeys through bathhouses, street 
markets, chic nightclubs, sports clubs where naked contestants engage in 
combat - suggesting both at once a world of decadence and near-anarchy.; But as he pursues Merrick, Wade finds himself caught in 
games between The President, the Special Prosecutor and the crime 
syndicates.; Like a number 
of recent films, `Redline' takes a post-Soviet Russia as its setting.; Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Takacs quotes other films - the graveyard of fallen 
Communist statues from `GoldenEye' (1995); an amusing parody of the 
oft-copied Odessa Steps sequence from Eisenstein's `Battleship Potemkin' 
(1925), recreated on a tv show called `Moscow's Deadliest Criminals'.","In fact with little rewriting the plot could  have 
easily have worked as a standard action film without the need for any 
future setting.; Set amid this are some neat science-fictional devices - 
flying spy satellites, virtual reality torture, advertisements for 
Hawaiian holiday resorts in Crimea.; Although by and large the film 
doesn't seem that interested in its Cyberpunk background - writers like 
William Gibson, Jack Womack or Bruce Sterling would have had field days 
with this milieu.; Canada's Tibor Takacs is a director of modest B-films that has in the 
past proven capable of quietly surprising with  efforts like `I, Madman' 
aka `Hardcover' (1989), `The Gate' (1987) and its even better sequel 
`Gate II' (1990) being better than they might have seemed.; Italian actress Yvonne Scio makes quite a promising English-language 
debut as the heroine."
64802.0,Love! Valour! Compassion!,1997.0,"Jason Alexander gives a strong 
performance.; had won the Tony for best play and I thought ""Great!; The dialogue, windy though it may be, is often 
funny and occassionally very touching.; Both actors give
solid, multi-faceted performances, bringing humor and delight to the
connection between two people who have assumed that it's too late for them
to experience love.; the movie is definitely better than L!V!C!","What a shame to see so many 
penises wasted on a mediocre story.; I'd had a fine time looking 
at the naked guys, particularly Randy Becker as a Puerto Rican dancer, 
and an awful time suffering through the actual play.; The
first problem is that the character who is supposed to hold the whole
plot together (the owner of the house in the country) is such a vacant,
bland person (and is played that way by the actor) that the story is
just a lose set of scenes.; Many mediocre plays, both gay and 
straight, have enjoyed long profitable runs by tossing in lots of nudity.; That's fine if you're trying to show heterosexuals that 
gays are really just plain folks."
65137.0,Father Hood,1998.0,"The similarities extend no further than plot
structure and character background, because IL LADRO DI BAMBINI is an
excellent movie, and viewing it makes the faults of FATHER HOOD seem
that much more glaring.; There may not have been many like me, but I was actually impressed
by Patrick Swayze's performance in CITY OF JOY.; It takes a good-
guy, bad-guy approach to the situation and presents it from a decidedly
singleminded viewpoint designed to stir the viewer's emotions, not make
him or her think about the seriousness of what's going on.; Starring:  Patrick Swayze, Halle Berry, Sabrina Lloyd, 
           Brian Bonsall, Michael Ironside
Director:  Darrell James Roodt
Producers:  Nicholas Pileggi, Anant Singh, and Gillian Gorfil
Screenplay:  Scott Spencer
Music:  Patrick O'Hearn
Released by Hollywood Pictures Jack Charles (Patrick Swayze) is a small time crook with a glib
answer for every question and two kids in foster care.; The two kids have their moments.","On top of all this, as if sitting through this movie isn't a bad
enough experience in the first place, the film makers manage to steal
away any possible tension through their structuring of the story.; While I would support a movie that grapples with the problem
sensitively and intelligently, this is not that film.; The script tries too hard to manipulate the audience into sympathizing
with them, and that immediately put me on guard.; If I had cared about the characters, perhaps the unbelievable
number of plot implausibilities wouldn't have bothered me as much, but
no one in this film manages to grab more than a token amount of
sympathy, especially not Jack, who is an annoying, arrogant jerk.; Movies of substance
rarely resort to such blatant emotional trickery."
65749.0,Tango,2000.0,"It's beautiful.; The name
Lalo Schifrin is synonymous with wonderful music.; What is
exceptional about this film, is how superbly choreographed and
stunningly colorful and visionary a spectacle it is, as its
cinematographer is the great Vittorio Storaro (LAST TANGO IN PARIS).; It may be simply the turning on of a fan, that immediately
shows us dresses moving in the wind, to immediately show us how an artist
can easily design and create his choreography.; The tango is danced
with passion by everyone, especially graceful were the two women stars
and the great tango dancer Julio Bocca.","TANGO runs way too long at 1:45.; Again, even that is confusing.; There is one
effective scene where he has a dinner date with Elena and he tries to explain
his feelings about men and women, and fails to make sense.; Writer and director Carlos Saura's TANGO, this year's Oscar nominated
foreign film from Spain, is a disappointment in just about every
dimension -- think FLASHDANCE without the flash or drama.; But these are
all hints of character development and nothing more."
66070.0,Bad Company,,"It's not
about drugs, the new universal threat.; Frank Langella and Spalding Gray create smarmy amoral
rich characters, complementing their costumes nicely with solid
performances of their routine lines.; It's not that the sex is all that spectacular, but it is between
Barkin and Fishburne, and it's almost unheard of for a Hollywood
movie to include an inter-racial relationship without being *about*
the inter-racial relationship.; Well-realized sets, a
good pace and some spiffy costumes dress up the goings on.; Almost every supporting character is the same,
interchangably cool and devious:  Michael Beach as a Tool Shed
operative; Michael Murphy as Crowe's CIA superior; Daniel Hugh Kelly
as a professional card player.","The problem is that BAD COMPANY isn't
really bad so much as it is simply mediocre.; The film, however, ultimately is completely forgettable.; BAD COMPANY is
loaded with double- and triple-crosses, but it's hard to care much
because the characters are so flat and bored-looking.; Then, gradually, it became clear that BAD COMPANY was all attitude.; Barkin, meanwhile, is even less
interesting."
66182.0,Yaaba,1986.0,"The movie, which won
the International Critics Award at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, takes us
into the world of Bila, a rambunctious boy living in a small village.; Sana lives by
herself away from the village, but Bila brings her food and keeps her
company; he affectionately calls her Yaaba, or grandmother.; Set and filmed in Africa, YAABA is an enchanting slice of life
which doesn't cater in any way to American audiences.; He is the village
rascal--good natured but always getting into trouble, usually with his
stern father.; When he's not
visiting Sana, Bila either plays with his flirtatious friend Nopoko or
fights with the other boys in the village.","You
could think of Bila as an African Huck Finn.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

66894.0,Ride,1997.0,A group of energetic young people burst into an impromptu musical number.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.,"Chipper, clueless Leta (Melissa DeSousa) is assigned by her nasty boss Bleau
(ex-MTV VJ Downtown Julie Brown, in bizarre makeup and fright wigs that make
her look more like Skid Row Sally) to chaperone some potential stars to a
video shoot in Florida.; That melodic moment is one of the many low points of ""Ride,"" a witless,
irritating comedy-drama that follows a dozen aspiring rappers from Harlem to
Miami.Former music-video auteur Millicent Shelton penned the script, which,
if you cut out all the obscenities and flatulence jokes, could comfortably
fit on the back of her business card.; Dr. Dre and Ed Lover turn up as a
pair of leering receptionists, the Afro-puffed Lady of Rage bulldozes
through her scenes as the villainous Peaches, Luther Campbell appears to
have been dragged from a hospital bed to play sleazy music mogul Freddie B,
and at one point, the bus breaks down just around the corner from a
backwater disco where Snoop Doggy Dogg improbably happens to be hanging out.; ""Ride""'s parade of offensive stereotypes features Charity (Idalis De Leon,
another MTV refugee), a siren who tries to sleep her way into a record deal;
sex-crazed Brotha (Sticky Fingaz); pregnant Tuesday (Kellie Williams),
Brotha's weepy, mistreated girlfriend; and Casper (Rueben Asher), a
jive-spouting white boy who refuses to believe he's not African-American.; Though ""Ride"" was written and directed
by a woman it's hardly a triumph for feminism, as every female character in
the film is either a tramp, an airhead, a witch or a weakling."
67899.0,Thick as Thieves,1997.0,"This notion is somewhat examined at times when we see Baldwin's obsession with
his dog or with music records and White's obsession with French food.; Sometimes films succeed without any normal characters (see ""Pulp
Fiction"") because the situations they are in are so outrageous and irregular
that they are enjoyable.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.; Jeneane Garafolo had a blink
and you missed her appearance.","The only good
guy in the film who comes close to an ""average Joe"" is a cop who spends the
whole film investigating the bad guys.; >From the opening point, writer-director Sanders should have elaborated into new
grounds.; The pathetic aspect though never disappeared.; It is very hard to determine if ""Thick as
Thieves"" is an attempted satire of an Elmore Leonard crime novel or a cheap
imitation of one.; Either way, it fails at what it tries to become, a clever
black comedy."
68274.0,Moonlight and Valentino,1998.0,"Gwyneth Paltrow (FLESH AND BONE, SEVEN) gives a wonderful
performance, mixing a natural upbeat energy with expressive eyes.; The ladies bond, de-bond, re-bond.; Her support system
includes her sister Lucy (Gwyneth Paltrow), her best friend, Sylvie
(Whoopi Goldberg), and her ex-stepmother, Alberta (Kathleen Turner).; She's convincing in the role, where she's
constantly trying to cope with repressed emotions.; Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner,
however, are not as impressive, with Goldberg seeming especially flat.","There's nothing radically wrong with the material--it's
just mundane and predictable.; The script, from a play by Neil Simon's daughter, suffers from
uninteresting everything: characters, acts, facts and dialogue.; It takes 29 minutes into the film  (during which time you waste
your energy deciphering matters) to establish relationships or
unscramble who's who and what's what.; The neighborhood seems to be bucolic suburbia--with too many
pretty landscape shots--of the ""On Golden Pond"" school.; In MOONLIGHT AND VALENTINO,
however, the actors save a rather ordinary screenplay from going down
the drain."
68427.0,Daughters of the Dust,1996.0,"Cinematography/FX: Possibly the most uniquely beautiful movie I have
ever seen; certainly in my top 5.; The reviewer
called this ""one of the best movies I have seen in years -- maybe the
best.""; Analysis:  One of the best movies I have seen in years.; The actors/actresses also did a great job.; The hired photographer (making a record of the family's last days on the
island) was an enjoyable character.","My feeling is that the director wanted to make a
documentary but for the reasons of collecting money (for the same
organization), she tried to make it more commercial by adding loose
plots of which she did a very poor job.; Well, here's a contrasting point of view:  DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST
was the *worst* movie we have seen in a long time!; My wife and I love ""art"" films and non-mainstream movies, but this
one was poorly directed and quite boring.; This is going to be a relatively short review because I only
watched half an hour before I got completely bored with this film.; I found the film to
be incredibly boring, and I am glad that I didn't pay any money to see
the film."
68543.0,Ping Pong,1997.0,"One of the best endings I can remember in
months--clever and tremendously satisfying.; It is an essential part, and she carries it out well capably.; I suspect that it may be better
the second time around, that there was enough cleverly-hidden symbolism that I
missed it the first time.; Perhaps not as emotionally satisfying as AMAZING
GRACE AND CHUCK or MY LIFE AS A DOG, but close, and even more intellectually
satisfying.; The name of this
film is PING PONG, and it tells the story of Sam Wong, an elderly Chinese
patriarch living in England who dies and leaves an explicit and aggravating
will behind him.","Also, a
daughter by an earlier marriage wants to receive more than what she was given
in the terms of the will, and her husband, who deals in illegal gambling, wants
to use the restaurant to further his games.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
68545.0,Intimate Relations,2001.0,"Surprised and reluctant
at first, he soon succumbs.; Veteran actress Julie Walters (best known for her role in EDUCATING 
RITA) is wonderful as Marjorie.; Also, from time-to-time, the characters are designed more as tools to be 
used in service of Goodhew's themes than as unique individuals.; On the school evening of Joy's 14th birthday party,
the landlady who insists her lodger call her Mum, sneaks into his
bedroom and slips under the bed covers of the reluctant lodger, and
won't leave until Harold capitulates and says yes.; Marjorie, in her perversity, and now having what she wants and
loving it,  gives him no rest.","These 
elements conspire to weaken the film just enough that the mixture of 
drama, suspense, and dark comedy fails to gel properly.; Harold had spent all of his young life
in institutions and lacks the will or ability to say ""No.""; But the film somehow couldn't get past its laughter at these
absurd characters and it failed to provide some pathos to go with the
dramatics.; Plot-wise, INTIMATE RELATIONS is nothing special.; The film is too 
long and too repetitive -- we get the point well before the final, 
inevitable act."
68546.0,Cotton Mary,2000.0,"Ismael
Merchant has done a bang-up job in adapting Alexandra
Viets' screenplay, ""Cotton Mary,"" mixing humor, pathos, and
satire in a narrative of a fairly insignificant, middle-aged
Anglo-Indian woman in 1954--seven years after India's
independence from Britain--who refuses to recognize herself
as anything but a representative of British stock.; The final
scene--a superb payoff that reminds one of Jean Genet's
uncharitable play ""The Maids"" (about two servants who take
turns playing the role of their employer)--ties the story
together strikingly in a single dramatic confrontation.; Ousmene Sembene captured the servility of the
diplomatic classes in Senegal to the French culture,
particularly to its language and dress, in his masterful film of
government corruption in ""Xala.""; Mary reassures Lily.; Set along the Malabar Coast in India in 1954, COTTON MARY is by
Merchant-Ivory Productions, a group so famous for costume dramas that
they probably hold several patents on the genre.","Mary is played by Madhur Jaffrey as a woman so unlikable
that she becomes an obnoxious, cliché of a villain.; What's perhaps even more wretched is the grandiosity of
those who are low on the totem pole: those who seek to put
themselves a few notches above their countrymen by their
identification with the departed Europeans.; Director
Ismail Merchant stages some lovely scenes of evening festivals but is
never able to make up for the lack of a compelling script.; After sketching out his characters, writer Alexandra Viets, who based
the script on her play, never gets around to filling them in.; Successfully bearing
false witness against her co-servant, Abraham, she
nonetheless considers herself a religious person--though she
is obviously using the accoutrements of worship such as The
Lord's Prayer to further her identity with the Anglican British."
68665.0,Daddy's Girl,1997.0,"This is one of a series of psycho-thrillers produced by Canada's Pierre

69040.0,Shy People,1998.0,"As you watch SHY PEOPLE, you're sure you know what it's about.; Hersey's sons and Clayburgh's
daughter seem more like types than characters, but the wonderful acting job
by Hersey manages to overcome these flaws and make this a film worth
watching.; Some of the subplots seem unnecessary, but they all fit together in the
end.; There she finds her cousin, played by Barbara Hersey.; This is not bad, just unexpected.","Clayburgh doesn't seem to
know how to play her character and remains unconvincing (or perhaps vague is
a better term) through most of the film.; She drags her teen-age daughter along to get her away from

Goldman becomes something of a marriage counsellor????; I was
hoping for a spectacular introduction in which Jamie and Steve kick
major butt with those wonderfully annoying metallic sounds of bionics at
work which we have become familiar with.; Jamie's circuits are breaking down, her bionic arm is experiencing

69327.0,Whore,2001.0,"Benjamin Mouton gives an
equally powerful performance as Russell's slimeball pimp.; This may be her best film yet.; Ken Russell's (no relation to Theresa) directing is excellent and
the writing is superb.; Theresa Russell gives a very powerful and emotional
performance.; WHORE is a gritty, depressing, graphic, yet powerful and emotional
film.","At least it wasn't distracting.; The actors don't send up with any moronic dialog, which
sometimes happens in films.; One a scale of zero to five, I give WHORE a five.; People who are out looking for cheap thrills will be sorely
disappointed with this film.; It contains minimal nudity, and the sex
scenes are less than erotic."
69351.0,Beauty and the Beast,1997.0,"Amazing.; BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is perfect family fare, and I highly recommend
it to anyone to go see.; And, of course, the characters are *great*!; BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is a *very* good film, and, if you haven't
gone to see it yet, I highly suggest you go out to see it.; Also, all of the ""little"" servants are just about the cutest thing
Disney has ever thought of, and I must say that the candlestick is my
favorite.","Perhaps the
filmmakers were subtly saying that women impressed by macho are just not
worth much effort.; And the stories
were really uninteresting.; Only one big production number, no ethnic
overtones.; They were
then animated in a perfunctory two-dimensional style.; But, with the exception of the dragon
sequence from SLEEPING BEAUTY and the ""Night on Bald Mountain"" sequence from
FANTASIA, there was not much beyond lukewarm imagination."
69828.0,Breaking In,1992.0,"Those familiar with the
work of the two men will recognize their trademarks: witty dialogue,
understated characters, and quiet humor.; I recommend it.; And for fans of Burt Reynolds, this
will be the chance to seem him in what is probably his best comedic role since
STARTING OVER in 1979.; It's the story of Ernie,  an
aging veteran burglar/safe-cracker who meets Mike, a kid with a casual 
disrespect for other people's property.; The real
interest in the film is watching Ernie, who treats crime as a job, try to
instill in Mike, who treats crime as an adventure, the attitude that will allow
Mike to survive as Ernie has.","Eschewing his characteristic smirk and unnaturally
curly hairpiece, Reynolds plays Ernie as written: a graying, 61-year old thief
with thinning hair, bad eyes and a limp.; This may deter viewers who cannot watch a film

illustrated.; The relationship that
develops is complex and multi-layered as the basic humanity of all
involved is uncovered.; OCTOBER
details the events during that long week from the perspective of the
abductors.; The no-win situation that arises when the government refuses to
honor the FLQ's demands fuels the ultimate conflict of conscience that
comprises the final act.","Motion pictures depicting the terrorist's point-of-view are not
especially popular, for obvious reasons.; Killing Laporte, in addition to being morally
reprehensible, would hurt the FLQ's image.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

69939.0,Body Parts,1998.0,"The film's score, as well, is excellent, and it goes a
long way toward establishing an appropriately chilling mood throughout
the film and during its (very) few scary scenes.; With all these films
about nasty and greedy eighties types getting rehabilitated into caring
and feeling Kevin Costner clones, the Phantom has been more than a
little worried that two of his favorite eighties holdovers -- Freddy and
Chucky, both due for a return appearance next month -- will similarly
renounce their selfish and destructive ways and learn to center
themselves in the universe and live in peace with those around them.; BODY PARTS is a film that turns out to be all too true to its name.; Somehow or other, the editors
managed to splice a good bit of an exceedingly average Tales >From the
Darkside with some of Jason's outtakes.; (The Phantom is,
however, heartened by the thought that Mr.  Dourif will be back next
month as the voice of Chucky in CHILD'S PLAY 3.)","So why does it seem
that the makers of BODY PARTS did all they could to keep their film from
the terrible taint of originality or interest?; On the other hand (sorry, couldn't resist), there have
been many too many horror films that fail to deliver more than
bottom-of-the-barrel slash and trash thrills.; Instead of wrapping the result
with twine and putting it out on the curb for that week's celluloid
recycling pickup, someone decided to make the most of it and make a
movie of it.; Unfortunately, we are graced by his
lunatic presence for only about 20 minutes or so during the exceedingly
average Tales From the Darkside section of the film.; Having said all this, the Phantom should add that BODY PARTS isn't
all bad, even if it is mostly dumb."
70042.0,Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey,1998.0,"Beside illustrating how effective the Theremin was, watching these
classics with the sometimes funny, sometimes frightening sounds is a
hoot.; For people interested in science,
inventions, or music, I especially recommend the movie.; What makes THEREMIN: AN ELECTRONIC
ODYSSEY so fascinating is that everything in the move is true, and the
people are not actors.; Moreover, you can see how this instrument was used in
many movies and heavily influenced all subsequent growth of electronic
music and even rock 'n roll.; I award the movie *** for a fascinating, unknown
subject.","The movie is complete with a ridiculous kidnapping and
exile by an evil foreign power.; By now, you are probably thinking, why would anyone want to know
more about such a silly instrument?; The editing by David Greenwald is pedestrian
with the exception of the scenes of the professor in his 90s wandering
around New York City.; One of his more intriguing
failures was a large mat that one dances on to make music.; The Theremin sounds like a violin,
well actually it sounds more like a Halloween parody of a violin."
70578.0,Trespass,2000.0,"He does an excellent job
in this film, and he alone makes the film worth going to see.; The soundtrack for the
film is great.; It
is exciting and the action sequences are great.; The music fits the film perfectly.; The two people who I enjoyed
the most in this film were Ice-T and the person who played the black man
who was living in the factory.","Certainly there have
been other directors who have done worse with far better material.; In the
case of the interracial Kevin Costner/Whitney Houston romance this may
be understandable, since drawing attention to it would be somewhat akin
to exploring the differences between Wonder Bread and Miracle Whip; but
in TRESPASS a potential means to get the audience up and throwing things
at the screen is simply ignored, with the result that everyone in the
cast seems curiously restrained most of the time, as if they'd all been
given a couple of doses of Prozac before the cameras started rolling.; Too, it might have helped to have released
TRESPASS *before* either RESERVOIR DOGS or BAD LIEUTENANT, for then
there wouldn't be such ample reminders of what a good director can do
given a well-crafted story, a literate script, and a surfeit of good
acting.; In
any event, the lack of such in a film made in 1992 serves to do little
but make it seem even more far-fetched and unrealistic than it already
is -- and TRESPASS is hardly well-grounded enough to be able to shoulder
the burden of also seeming like some sort of bizarre urban fairy tale in
which the warehouse walls are all that separate the good white guys from
the bad black guys.); Once our brave firemen (one good white guy and one bad white guy;
the Phantom will let you find out for yourself how many good black guys
and bad black guys there are) barricade themselves in the warehouse the
film more or less starts to fall apart."
70805.0,Sunday,1995.0,"As wonderfully effective as the quiet scenes are in SUNDAY, 
Nossiter takes his share of missteps.; Both
Suchet and Harrow give intense, emotionally rich performances as people
taking a momentary escape from their bleak lives by clothing themselves in
attractive fictions.; As a love story, SUNDAY is often
beautiful and haunting.; Nossiter's feature debut, the Best Dramatic Film winner at the 1997
Sundance Film Festival, ponders the nature of identity and the buried
desires of lost souls through the story of a chance meeting one Sunday in
Queens.; David Suchet, best know as television's most recent and best
Hercule Poirot, plays a homeless man named Oliver.","However, the worst these flaws can do is occasionally 
mute SUNDAY's power.; Here's what KICKED IN THE HEAD _is_:  a gruellingly unfunny 89
minutes spent following an annoying, unsympathetic young man named
Redmond (Kevin Corrigan) on a ""spiritual quest"" through the Lower East
Side, which apparently consists of 1) using plenty of beer and cocaine, 2)
writing plenty of bad poetry and 3) spending plenty of time with people
who are even more annoying and unsympathetic than himself.; The writers
have surprisingly little to say, and what is said is quite dated and
unrealistic.; And it's not
worth a moment of your time.; It would have served the film better if it
didn't become so arty and give us so many unimportant shots of lobsters
and Queens."
71114.0,Cleopatra,2000.0,"Despite its suitably gargantuan flaws the film remains a compelling story of
tremendous spectacle and power, with much that is worth seeing.; Roddy McDowell is wonderful as the
ambitious and unscrupulous Octavian.; Yet it has many of the
elements that made those stories such hits: famous actors, a big budget,
spectacle, an timeless story.; Even today the story of Cleopatra is one to conjure with, constantly inspiring
new generations of filmakers around the world.; _Cleopatra_ tells the story of the queen of Egypt, played by an overwrought
Elizabeth Taylor, and her love affairs with Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison in a
performance any mannikin could have done just as well) and Mark Anthony
(Richard Burton, magnificently).","Rex Harrison as Caesar is even
worse, delivering his lines like a college professor spouting off bon mots at
a cocktail party.; _Cleopatra_ would have been much better had it
started with Caesar's death or been divided into two films.; The
music is foul.; Reviewed by Michael A. Turton (turton@cc.fy.edu.tw) Despite its inclusion in a decade of heroic epics that offered such classics
as _Ben Hur_, _Spartacus_, and _Lawrence of Arabia_, _Cleopatra_ has failed
to find the enduring popularity of those staples.; Cleopatra was shot at the tail end of the frenzy of epics that marked the
1950s and early 1960s, yet its as if its filmakers were still struggling to
get a handle on the epic as an art form."
71118.0,Felicidades,1999.0,"The film is in Spanish with English 
subtitles.; It is a truly magical moment.; All of the characters 
appear in a musical montage set to a rock version of ""Silent Night"" and 
sung in English.; Web: http://www.InternetReviews.com

Good Samaritan into helping him out, but his helper wants to get back to 
his new find, a beautiful woman named Laura (Silke).","It is not rated but would be PG-13 for the animal death 
scene.; The only big laugh at our screening came from the death of a little dog, 
a scene better played for tragedy than comedy.; It wants to be 
a heart-warming film, but it comes across flat and relatively humorless.; He ends up giving a ride to one of the partygoers, and 
they run out of gas in the middle of nowhere.; It's too bad that the 
rest of the picture isn't up to this level."
71140.0,Hear No Evil,,"On the other hand, the atmosphere of the
film is very well-done, Oregon locations seems refreshing,
and sometimes, the horror that waits our heroine can be
sensed by the audience too.; Marlee Matlin is superb, and she
has a good chemistry in the romantic scenes with D.B.; Marlee Matlin's Jillian is especially
effective - a mixture of sensitivity, humor, and strength.; Marlee Matlin is a great actress, and it is real pity that
we don't see her more often in the movies.; When it comes to character development (at least that of the
primary characters), atmosphere, and a relatively-intelligent portrayal
deafness, HEAR NO EVIL is a good movie.","There are far too many contrivances and
coincidences for this picture to be credible.; Instead of going for
a slick ending with an abysmal twist, they should have stuck to a
straight thriller.; The writers should have
given the audience credit for some intelligence.; At least HEAR NO EVIL doesn't give us yet another clone of FATAL
ATTRACTION and/or THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE.; These don't work as well as they
could have, principally because they aren't completely silent - there's
an annoying background tinkling, as of distant wind-chimes ringing."
71373.0,Black Rainbow,1997.0,"Arquette is excellent in an understated performance.; It also shows the Jewish police
chief, Irving Weinberg (Rosenthal), knew about the hit and covered it up
to protect Silas.; Robards brings a
certain sense of tragic power to his role.; The rainbow visions appear to be black, and
she sinks into despair with the troubled world she sees.; While under the capable
direction of Mike Hodges (Get Carter), the film is superbly paced and
plays up the ambiguity of the story in a satisfactory manner.","But when the newspaper ran the story about the medium,
it also ran a series of stories charging the police are not doing enough
to investigate the crime and call for him to start interviewing the
medium.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; It turns out she knows the name and what the murderer looks like
and tells this to the reporter, thereby putting the pressure on the
police to investigate the crime fully."

71376.0,Malicious,1993.0,"John Vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not-so-bright
baseball jock who initially gets swept away by Melissa (one of the script's
faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre-med student).; Directed by Ian Corson.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.; Starring Molly Ringwald, John Vernon, Mimi Kuzyk.","I won't reveal
the ludicrous ending to this turkey, but I warn you that it's both
painfully obvious and a real yawner.; It starts to drag, unfortunately, after this.; And, of
course, she stalks, so we see a number of shots, which are supposed to be
suspenseful, where she's spying on Doug and his girlfriend.; Comments:  MALICIOUS, I suppose, is an acceptable moview for what it is: a
cheap, B-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of
spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films (like FATAL ATTRACTION, HAND

71687.0,My Life's in Turnaround,1998.0,"Nevertheless, that is one - and only one - of the many charms 
of MY LIFE'S IN TURNAROUND, a unique and surprising motion picture from 
two delightfully offbeat filmmakers.; Plimpton's raunchy scene 
with Schaeffer and Ward is, like the Sayles sequence, a definite 
highlight.; The two guys were actually at this screening which was a
surprise.; Sayles is 
magnificent here, at his over-the-top best.; For me, 
it is.","The problem was that they 
didn't have a script - or even the idea for a script (""I think this whole
idea thing is overrated"") - nor did they know the first thing about 
production, direction, or camerawork.; If this sounds boring and weird, it isn't.; They have no ideas, no
script and maybe no talent.; She tries to ""get them meetings"" with various
producers but they manage to mess them all up with their lack of
direction.; Half the involved people were convinced, even after the production 
wasunderway, that the project would not be finished."
71801.0,X,1990.0,"Telling an apocalyptic story with stirring, visual panache, this
Japanese animated movie (anime) dazzles us with its depressing images
and dramatic music.; This
describes the experience of watching X, which Rin directs with a
Mixmaster approach.; Once there, he seeks out his best friend Fuma and his sister
Kotori.; The plot is
farfetched, yes, but it's also utterly engrossing; we don't just see
our planet being put at risk, we care.; Helped
out tremendously by a poignant ending, X manages to turn the tables,
avoid the formulas and weave a compelling human story into a kinetic
science fiction thriller.","Anime fans will no doubt be thrilled
by the movie, but many of my fellow moviegoers will likely echo my
overall opinion about X: It just doesn't make any sense.; Japanese must be a very difficult
language to translate because the few animes that I have seen have all
featured very awkward dialogue.; It seems much effort has gone into
making a few choice scenes perfect, which the rest languishes in
lifeless backdrops upon which to kill the supporting cast in fountains
of blood.; PRINCESS MONONOKE had no such problem, and the ridiculousness of the
script for X permeates every scene.; I am not at all an anime (adult Japanese animation) aficionado; I have
seen very little and what I have seen has not particularly enthused me."
73109.0,Payback,1995.0,"This film does more for the strange art of revenge than most films of
its kind and it's refreshing to watch since revenge is something we've
all wanted at some point in our lives whether we want to admit it or
not.; Fortunately, the slower middle portion is bookended by a great opening
sequence and a nice finishing touch.; series 'Tales from the Crypt'.; I exhaled with delight as 'Payback' is one of
the best films released in the second month of the last year of the
twentieth century.; Towne won an Oscar for perhaps one of the cinema's most complex
screenplays of the modern era---'Chinatown' in 1974.","What starts out as an
ultra-violent revenge movie ends as an ultra-violent revenge movie with not
much difference in between.; Another depressing factor of the
film was that everything was shot when it was really cloudy or with no light,
there isnât one scene in the movie that has an lighting at all.; But
this film is way too much like Twilight, starring Paul Newman, to be any good.; However,
maybe it *is* Porter's stubborn badassedness that helps save this movie.; I also see no reason why the female
characters were in this film at all because they didnât bare their chests,
which in this type of movie, seems like the only important thing they could do."
73138.0,Face,1999.0,"It aimed for style and a
maddening fast pace and got both--which makes it entertaining.; The two leaders are Ray (Carlyle), a former East End commie
who has lost faith in the cause and is now out for himself as a professional
thief.; The film becomes a study about criminality and their greedy
nature, with Carlyle distinguishing himself in the role of the disillusioned
thief whose idea of comradeship fails for both the cause he supported and in his
gang of robbers.; The others are: Stevie (Waddington) is someone Ray
feels sorry for because he's not all there and he has looked out for him ever
since they were cellmates; Julian (Davis) is an unstable petty hood without much
experience and is also money hungry; While Jason (Damon Albarn-the lead singer
for the rock band Blur) is valuable because his uncle is a veteran mobster,
Sonny (Peter Vaughn), a man with connections.; Dennis Schwartz: ""Ozus' World Movie Reviews"" © ALL RIGHTS RESERVED   DENNIS SCHWARTZ The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","But the film fails
to get you to care for any of these characters, though it tries hard to get you
to believe that Ray is not a bad guy.; This gutsy crime film with
political overtones fails to be convincing.; It
just seems like another mindless film in a long list of streetwise crime stories
that are now hard to remember because they all seem to run together.; It was not possible for me to
believe Carlyle has any political insight, never mind him being an idealist.; After director Antonia Bird (Mad Love) did a disappointing tour in Hollywood,
she's gone back home to do a native crime caper film that is in the style of
British crime films like ""Get Carter,""  ""The Long Good Friday"" and ""Brighton
Rock."""
73435.0,Air Force One,2000.0,"Looking back, this was an enjoyable movie held together by Ford's
typically charismatic performance and some nice FX
and action sequences.; All in all, AIR FORCE ONE gives a convincing illusion of
being the most believable and ably constructed of the summer stock.; He is
a man who has impeccable character and would without hesitation place
his family and Nation above himself.; Even though this is not a Tom Clancy
film, one can't help but notice the similarities between the President
in this film and Clancy's Jack Ryan.; Unlike L.A.","This made no sense at all.; Airforce One is your
standard stock Hollywood Blockbuster....which was
disappointing.; It seems condescending when they dish out
freebie favours for a struggling Russian government made to look weak
and pathetic in the movie.; If Harrison hadn't 'saved the day' in the
end she would have been responsible for allowing the release of a
 homicidal madman responsible for 10 000's of deaths in
return for the half-dozen people left on the plane at that
stage.; Even if the plane is supposed
""unlandable,"" surely it must be safer to ditch at sea then do a trapeze
act at 10,000 feet."
73482.0,Siegfried & Roy: The Magic Box,2000.0,"And IMAX doesn't disappoint here; Box is a lot of fun to
watch, as long as you don't pay much attention to the actual content of
the film, which tells the life story of S & R. Siegfried Fischbacher grew up in Rosenheim, Germany, and became obsessed
with magic at an early age.; The paths of the two future Vegas
performers finally crossed aboard a luxury liner, where Siegfried
performed his magic and Roy was a waiter.; Well, somebody must have heard me and then gone out and
made Siegfried & Roy: The Magic Box, the latest film made for IMAX in
their wonderful 3-D format.; On the plus side, director Brett Leonard (IMAX's T-Rex: Back to the
Cretaceous) does a great job connecting scenes together with incredible
3-D images, a lot of which reminded me of the Dutch film Character for
some reason.; Much is made of S & R's difficulties growing up in war-torn Germany, but
I couldn't help but think that they were better off there than in Poland
or Austria during World War II.","That just means one of them was a really bad cook.; Besides, why did they have to eat
burnt potatoes?; It's hard to feel sorry
for them when they wear ridiculous outfits, live in fabulously gaudy
homes and seem more concerned with their tans and their hair than they
do anything else.; 0:50  Not Rated, and should contain nothing offensive or frightening

74108.0,Stella polaris,1999.0,"It has a lot of the feel of a
documentary--we see Germany occupying Noway in the second world war and
burning the village to the ground when they leave; we see the villagers
returning after the war to rebuild; we see the traditional fishing
industry of small boats (with wives tying hooks and gutting fish) being
replaced by fish factories and larger, more dangerous trawlers.; I found it hard work, but others may
be able to relax into the dreamy feel of the fjords and enjoy.; The film chronicles her youth without words, almost without plot,
using images and music only.; and the people she knew.; at two different times.","It is not clear why she is in

74340.0,Amazing Grace and Chuck,2000.0,"Special kudos to: both Zuehlke (a real-life Little League pitcher who was
picked for the part) and English (a forward for the Denver Nuggets) for their
seamless personification of their characters; Jamie Lee Curtis, who takes a
surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as Amazing's manager
and friend; William L. Peterson (in a *big* change from his role in TO LIVE AND
DIE IN L.A.) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and
wave a flag doing it; and Gregory Peck, as the guy we wish Ronald Reagan REALLY
was (and who some numbskulls still probably think he is <-- acid political
opinion).; America has always had its
mythical heros, its Paul Bunyans and John Waynes; this film presents us with
more general, but still universal, ideals: the honest, innocent children who
have their own inner wisdom; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of
courage, honor, and love for their respective sport; the venerable elected
official who leads with kindness and understanding, but has the grit to get
things done when they need doin' (does the latter sound familiar?).; This is a very sturdy scenario.; Astounding!; AMAZING
GRACE AND CHUCK is a showcase for these characters, but it never leaves you
with the feeling that it's artificial, that it stands behind glass, or that any
sharp breeze--or, more importantly, sharp thought--will shatter the wax facade
of the panorama.","I don't want to give too much away, but the basic premise is that Chuck
(Joshua Zuehlke), the Little League pitcher, decides to give up baseball
because of nuclear weapons.; Another
SHORT CIRCUIT.; Let me just say this, though: I am not
recommending this film because I think it has a great message or because of any
political positions it might imply.; Screw
what I think.; Another E.T."
74474.0,Varian's War,1999.0,"Written and directed by Lionel Chetwynd, this is an amazing story, not only of courage but of suppression, since the ""enemy"" was the Vichy French.; ""How we rise to meet the challenge is how our children will judge us,"" says Varian Fry - and that's still true of our dilemmas today.; On the Granger TV-Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Varian's War"" is a  moving, heroic, engrossing 8.; Fry's aided by an idealistic American (Julia Ormond), a forger (Alan Arkin) and a refugee (Matt Craven).; At great risk to his own life, he saved prominent artists, musicians and writers, ""the soul of Europe,"" as well as 2,000 others, from Nazi persecution.","uggles out the original musical manuscripts of her former husband, Gustav Mahler.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

74629.0,Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman,1997.0,"We must realise that growing bigger doesn't necessarily
make our problems any smaller.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","The ending is pure feminist propaganda.; When a 50 ft. woman demands sexual attention how can one say no, less
they be trampled on.; The male chauvinistic pig is
made to spend an eternity caged, under the watchful eye of his giant
wife.; Wear a rubber suit?"".; The helicopters are in much need of target practice, after
shooting a hundred missiles before one finally finds its mark."
75006.0,Moby Dick,1998.0,"I love Patrick Stewart.; He delivers the big lines with force, and the movie 
is worth seeing for any Stewart fan, just for those scenes.; This story is not to be missed, for it is part of our
history.; At the end,
there's some smoke that is a little cheesy, but I happen to know how
hard smoke is, and I was impressed.; Even after
Babylon 5 ruined me on TV SF, I would still go back and watch re-runs
of Star Trek: The Next Generation for his outstanding
performances.","Second mistake: The director.; Ok, so you want to make a movie about a
whale.; Third Mistake: Historical detail.; Fourth Mistake: Rendering.; There
is a sequence at the end of the film where I had to laugh (if you've
read the book, you should know that laughing at the end of the movie
is just plain out of context)."
75531.0,Isn't She Great,1997.0,"Hmmm...not so great in my eyes, but definitely an interesting
behind-the-scenes look into the life and times of one Jacqueline Susann and
her rise to fame.; Starting from the 1920s and into the
late 60s, this movie also accentuates the impact of her relationship with
husband/publicist Irving Mansfield.; Midler and Lane both seem to have quite a bit of fun as these
larger than life lovers, as do Stockard Channing as Flo, Jackie's
gin-guzzling confidante (on the subject of authors, she says, ""You think
about Hemingway and Dickens and, well, I'm sure there are others"") and
John Cleese in an all too brief appearance as the so-hip-it-hurts
publisher who takes a chance on ""Dolls.""; The movie/book have now skyrocketed to the top of 
must-see/must-read list.; And fame is what our Jackie was after.","Mediocre?; Borderline awful?; Susann couldn't write sentiment convincingly and neither can Rudnick.; There is something decidedly pathetic and unfunny 
about a joke aimed at a dying woman's hospital suite- just one of the 
many cracks made in the 95 minute production.; It simply does not work, 
and any cast or crew member should have discovered this when they read the 
script, unless they were all in it for the money and did not care about 
faithfully preserving the life of Susann."
75686.0,Hexed,1997.0,"He does an excellent job.; HEXED is a very funny film that is enjoyable to just sit down and
watch.; Nonetheless, since I expected little, I was pleasantly surprised by
Alan Spencer's new film, HEXED.; Arye Gross (HOUSE 2: THE SECOND STORY, SOUL
MAN) gives a great performance.; Perhaps the funniest part of the film was the sex scene between
Hexina and Matthew.","So I opted instead for what
threatened to be a stupid comedy.; What a weak selection of movies there was this weekend.; Designed to parody the Rodney King
incident (with the line by the white victim of ""I'm a Republican""
supposedly providing the irony), it's unclear why this moment wasn't
relegated to the cutting room floor--its presence is disgraceful.; Claudia Christian does a fine job by the
standards of high camp, but even her die-hard fans would be hard-pressed
to justify sitting through ninety minutes of this dross simply to listen
to her screeching lines, and watch her making faces and strutting around
in a black leather mini-skirt.; Offensive, humorless, and tiresome are more appropriate
adjectives."
76330.0,Wild Man Blues,1993.0,"Today, thanks to
Barbara Kopple's new documentary called WILD MAN BLUES, we visit with
Woody Allen, his lover, his sister, and his jazz band as they tour
Europe in style befitting royalty.; What is particularly sound about ""Wild Man Blues"" is that it
is not a puff piece but rather presents the man as both flawed
human being and as a man who despite his chief
psychological hangup--by Mr. Allen's admission his alleged
inability to experience pleasure--is nonetheless able to lose
himself when blowing into his clarinet.; Allen, long a bigger box office draw in Europe than he is in America,
attracts fervent fans everywhere he goes and fills concert halls in Paris,
Turin and London, although it's doubtful most of the patrons are there
solely because of their appreciation for jazz anymore so than theatergoers
lined up to see Madonna in ""Speed-the-Plow"" expecting to see a virtuoso
performance.; What will likely intrigue most viewers -- especially those who hunger for
good gossip -- is the film's portrayal of Allen's relationship with his
youthful wife and former ward whom he introduces as ""the notorious Soon Yi
Previn.""; ""He's great,"" effuses one of his adoring fans.","Neither is it worshipful of its central figure (that was 
one of the chief failings of Jim Jarmusch's dull, lifeless look at Neil 
Young, YEAR OF THE HORSE).; And I get no sense for why this movie was made.; The point of this movie seems to be that you get to watch Woody
Allen for an hour and a half.; It doesn't help that his mother
at the end tells the camera he's nothing like his screen persona, and that
his movies reflect very little of Woody Allen the person.; Actually, the film serves as proof that he
doesn't enjoy anything."
76406.0,Tokyo-Ga,2000.0,"It
is filtered through Wenders's own preoccupations with cinema and the ways
it can both reveal and distort truth.; The documentary was made in between two of Wenders's great works,
PARIS, TEXAS and WINGS OF DESIRE.; Wenders holds Ozu in the highest esteem: he
describes the revered Japanese director's oeuvre as the closest thing to a
""sacred treasure"" in the cinema.; It is in this sampling of everyday peculiarities that Wenders seeks
insight into contemporary Japan, circa 1985.; And his method
is effective: he succeeds in capturing, obliquely, something of the
paradoxes which underlie Japanese society, the marriage of Western fashions
to Eastern idiosyncracies.","The feeling is not helped

77064.0,Public Access,1964.0,"He provides a solid counterpoint to the naturalistic
performances of the townspeople, and his rendering of Whiley Pritcher
almost sells PUBLIC ACCESS singlehandedly.; It's a dark tale of family values gone awry, and
manages to establish an effective tone of simmering menace.; PUBLIC ACCESS is an ambitious, stylish film that manages to find
itself both inches from brilliance and inches from complete
impenitrability.; Ron
Marquette, a dead ringer for Harry Connick Jr., plays Whiley as a
telegenic Mr. Rogers, a smiling snake oil salesman with a comforting
tone who has discovered the perfect medium for getting what he wants.; The technical credits are superb,
particularly the evocative score and taut editing, both by San Jose
native John Ottman.","The unfortunate result of this is
that when the movie isn't incomprehensible, it's pretty dull...so boring
that I actually dozed off.; Nothing in Singer's direction
really stands out except lingering shots of a ceiling fan and a glass
of water which scream ""meaningful.""; PUBLIC
ACCESS, as a feature film, seems far from finished, as if it needs another
run or two through the editing room.; Otherwise, you're
just as well off watching your own public access channel.; What were Whiley's
motivations, or do they even matter?"
77128.0,Absolution,1986.0,"The ending of ABSOLUTION also
represents something which is quite rare in modern Hollywood
thrillers - it is both unexpected, yet very believable and
fits within the context of the story.; However, despite these flaws and despite the
fact that it might prove too disturbing for some of the more
sensitive viewers, ABSOLUTION is nevertheless powerful and
thought-provoking film that would leave long lasting
impression on those who see it.; The acting in this
film is superb, with Richard Burton allowing audience both
to despise and sympathise with his rigid character.; Billy
Conolly is also very impressive as his carefree and often
larger- than-life opposite.; Because of that constant uncertainty, the atmosphere of
the film is very dark and unusually bitter ending comes as
something quite natural.","Unfortunately, Anthony Page's direction is best-suited for
this film, because he employs shock tactics in the film that

77291.0,Orfeu,1987.0,"Now comes a film that takes ""Bossa Nova"" a
few steps further, transporting romance into poetry rather
than pleasant fluff and dealing quite an edge of tragedy to the
goings on in the land of the Cariocans.; The film is in Portuguese with English 
subtitles.; Diegues does a good job balancing several motifs: the
battles with the drug lords led by the police sergeant,
Pacheco (Stepan Nercessian) who hates the poor and given
the chance would level the favela; the delayed romance of
the two principles, which makes us wonder whether they ever
will get together; the envy of the women from Orfeu's first girl
friend on down; the desire of Orfeu's mother, Conceicao
(Zeze Motta) to get her son to leave town.; Narrative aside, the best aspect of this film is the luscious
shots that cinematographer Affonso Beato captures of the
dazzling, colorful carnival, principally the competition among
various Samba schools which practice all year for the
competition.; The Portuguese language adds harmony to
Orfeu's rhythms, adding color to a movie that only the most
reality-obsessed person in the audience could ignore.","For every gorgeous outdoor scene there 
is a poorly filmed interior one.; Every time you are ready to completely give up on the movie, the camera 
pulls back to reveal another stunning vista, or the music comes up with

parents.; This movie has
many of the elements needed to create a good movie, including plenty of
humor, dramatic moments, confident directing and wonderful acting

resonant feelings of Thanksgiving, including the cozy nature of the picture,
the light, agreeable soundtrack, the wonderful presentations of food and
drink, and the ultimate feelings of love and anger shared by family members
throughout.; These two
families represent the extremes in acceptance of other cultures and
close-mindedness (ironically, it's Trinh Nguygen (Joan Chen), not her
husband or her mother, who clings most to the Vietnamese way of life).; ""What's Cooking"" is a solid little film that should endure as a holiday

death: ""There is something called the closeness
of the death: Can your feel it?; Anyone who has seen a few of Bergman's works from
the 1940s and 1950s understands that this is
obviously his writing: the religous doubts of a
man, the feelings of guilt for the lack of faith
and the envy for those who have it since this
means a solution to all problems.; Bo's fear of death is a theme that is repeated through
the movie: Back in Stockholm, he shares an apartment with
his best friend Göran and Göran's flirtatious wife

terrific special effects (e.g.; _Twister_ is so real and powerful and, above all, entertaining, that to 
complain that the story is a little hokey or the characters said cliched 
lines is a fundamental misunderstanding of the film.; The film is tremendously enjoyable and
truly showed me sights that I had never seen before.; Unlike in _Jurassic_Park_, de Bont has the good sense to treat the human 
characters like what they are: bit players.; Jack N. Green, _Twister_'s cinematographer and Clint Eastwood's 
for the gorgeous _Unforgiven_ and _Bridges_of_Madison County_, pulls off 
some truly amazing helicopter shots and shots that require expert 
timing.","Dull and uninteresting.; At least with a boring
drama movie there's hope for a suprise ending to make amends.; I'm not sure if the problem is the actress or the part, but
whichever, the character has too little substance.; I've seen a lot of bad movies before but never one this boring.; The writer seems to be content with the characters studying it
electronically which is quite boring for the audience."
77946.0,Shiloh 2: Shiloh Season,2000.0,"His realistic portrayal of the backwoods
curmudgeon gives the movie's message a depth of meaning that many other
moralistic films do not achieve.; Of course, Marty has personally witnessed how
wicked Judd can be, but the teacher's point is a good one nevertheless.; Just thinking about
the best doggie movie ever made, Fred M. Wilcox's ""Lassie
Come Home"" (1943), sets my tears rolling.; It takes
a great deal of commitment, perseverance, and an unwillingness to settle
for less.; My son Jeffrey, age 10, called it ""such a sweet little movie"" and gave
it *** 1/2.","""Shiloh 2"" may be acceptable for undiscriminating young 
viewers, and is certainly a few steps up from the awful ""Inspector Gadget,"" 
but the movie has not an ounce of originality and mostly plays like a corny 
episode of the old television show, ""Lassie.""; Though the sequel is related in the same
unadorned manner, with Troy Smith's camera capturing the
Thoreauvian simplicity of a village that seems to have sprung
out of the '40's, the poignant edge of the original is just not
there.; It
tries hard to teach without being preachy.; If a dog, owned by a
man who abuses it, runs away into the arms of an adorable
11-year-old kid, should that kid have the moral right to keep
it?; Inspector Gadget this ain't."
77954.0,Restoration,1997.0,"For those who like films that show them a bit of a different world
and a different time, this film should be a pleasant surprise.; The British are famous for their period pieces, and, while 
RESTORATION isn't among the best (all of Jane Austen's adapted novels 
are superior), it's still solid entertainment, especially in a season 
when Hollywood's releases are repeatedly causing grimaces.; There are no credits  at the
beginning, and I find that this is great.; All the performances are
excellent, and the film seems to be really well focused on its themes.; As we travel with Rowe,
we marvel and wonder at the sumptuous life.","Boring.; He
finds it boring, and not pleasing, not to mention that it ruins  much of his
social life.; The problem with RESTORATION can be summed up in two words, poor
direction.; It is rated R for tame

medieval medical practices.; Other than David Thewlis' 
effectively-rendered John Pearce and Ian McKellan's Will Gates, none of 
them displays much personality -- they're gone too quickly."

than merely ""good.""; 81,"" is by no means an earth-shattering, important

78406.0,"Steal Big, Steal Little",1993.0,"Following her death, Reuben
becomes the owner of a forty-thousand acre ranch--property he is more
than happy to share with the immigrant workers who tend to the lemon
orchards.; The film may seem to last forever, but at least we have Arkin and
Pantoliano along for most of the ride, and their presence alleviates a
great deal of potential boredom.; At
first, Reuben thinks it's all an elaborate game, and by the time he
realizes Robby is in earnest, it's too late.; The story is basically about the
importance of family and community, and how good-intentioned underdogs
can triumph over the corrupt forces of big business.; The salvation of STEAL BIG, STEAL LITTLE are superb comic
performances by Alan Arkin (as Reuben's friend and advisor, Lou
Perilli) and Joe Pantoliano (as Reuben's double-crossing lawyer).","Garcia doesn't quite manage to
bring either of his personalities to life, and this hurts the execution
of an already weak script.; This film is
horribly edited, resulting in a finished production that clocks in at a
bloated one-hundred thirty-five minutes.; Occasional scenes of madcap
humor add a momentary spark to the predictable proceedings, but there's
never enough outrageousness to start a fire.; In
STEAL BIG, STEAL LITTLE, an affable but too-long dramatic comedy from
THE FUGITIVE director Andrew Davis, twins are, as usual, convenient
devices upon which to hang a stale plot.; Considering that one of the strengths of THE FUGITIVE was its
tight pacing, it's an unpleasant surprise that STEAL BIG, STEAL LITTLE
plods aimlessly towards a predictable conclusion."

spooky tale about murderous sea creatures.; She tells her leader that she wants more

the very moral visitor to the Deer Well to heal his physical injuries.; This lost film was reconstructed
from a single print found at Cinematheque Francaise in Paris and
producer Anthony Taylor recently recorded it on video for the first
time.; It's filled with hokum, as it
tells about the battle for souls between the God of Light and the God of

Strangelove"", ""Being There"" is his greatest performance on film.; Several years later, the
subtleties in this film, are still quite apparent, and the acting, specially
Peter Sellers, is excellent.; This film, is, still, today, one of the very nice examples what a piece of
fluff in Hollywood can come out like.; Chancy Gardner, may be a bit retarded, but his sense of awe and beauty, at
least keep him alive.; But the
real touch of wonder in this film is that the character is so strong all the
way through, and so oblivious to anything that is happening around him, from
the realities about life, to a woman, whose own feelings she is learning to
get in touch with, and eventually, the outcome of the film.","And even if

Arkin, the consummate professional, is wonderfully dry as director of
the camp.; All of them have been in good projects
in the past and doubtless we will be graced by additional fine
performances in the future.; Of course, there are various
interpersonal dramas that have to be resolved.; The camp director,
Uncle Lou (Alan Arkin) has invited them back for a final get-together
as he prepares to close the camp.","As it is, INDIAN SUMMER is just a
singularly unremarkable and uninteresting movie.; Obviously there's a lot of nostalgia
involved for him, but he fails to get it across to the audience.; The story is simplistic and the character conflict weak.; Binder fails in both the directing
and writing fronts and if he hadn't chosen such an exemplary cast, this
could have been a real disaster.; There
isn't an original moment in the film."
80699.0,Miss Julie,1997.0,"Reviewed by Harvey Karten
 United Artists/Moonstone Entertainment
 Director: Mike Figgis
 Writer: Helen Cooper, Mike Figgis, play by August Strindberg
 Cast: Saffron Burrows, Peter Mullan, Maria Doyle Kennedy Since conflict is the quintessential aspect of novels, theater
and movies, it makes sense that some of the most intriguing
tales put people of two different worlds into the same room
and watch them try to mesh--inevitably to fail.; It's filled with
beautifully written scenes of emotional conviction.; It's a brilliant play, one which observes naturalistic behavior and
flawed, complex characters without judgment.; But one wonders why Mike Figgis, best known for the
wonderfully imaginative fall-of-grace movie ""The Loss and
Sexual Innocence"" and the compelling tale of an alcoholic
determined to commit suicide via the bottle, ""Leaving Las
Vegas,"" would dedicate himself to the Strindberg work.; Under the disapproving eye of the cook, Christine (Maria
Doyle Kennedy), who is the fiance of the footman, Jean
(Peter Mullan), Julie (Saffron Burrows) flirts openly with Jean,
forcing him to dance repeatedly with her.","Would this be a Figgis film without smutty groping
and breast fondling every ten minutes?; While the performances of the three principals are
satisfactory, with Saffron Burrows alternately weeping,
cajoling, and expressing her anxieties with wide eyes while
the handsome and dignified Peter Mullan drives her on
toward destruction, the movie fails to make Strindberg's dated
play come to life on the screen.; After that
image, there's hardly any point to watching the rest of the film, which
is her last gasp of inflicting her will on the macho, belligerent and
self righteous servant, who continually mutters that she on her pedestal
can never understand the lives of those below.; Naturally, Figgis is
so hell bent on his radical tinkering with form and content that the
story becomes a muddle of sensual implications taken straight from
fashion magazine perfume ads.; Most of the action takes place in a
kitchen, and the one outside vista looks like a production
design rather than a natural habitat."
80893.0,Let's Get Lost,2000.0,"That silence, and the performance which follows, is a fitting elegy
to a genius who lived hard yet made it all look so easy.; It's a near perfect blend
of styles, yet it is never showy or pushy.; It's a film about contrasts, about the profound affect one
man had on the lives of others.; Almost forty years later, the change is dramatic.; Then, and only then, do we feel the
man's sincerity, his quietly hushed and sexy vocal style totally absorbing the
viewer.","The list seems endless.; Baker's once
Adonis-like looks are wizened -- wrinkled creases of skin abound; aged, hollowed
out eyes; bloodless cheeks; a leather-faced, lipless junkie.; There is a lot of hate in this movie; few people have

83036.0,Titanic Town,1999.0,"And in this gritty, realistic, and excellently acted
film, those daily horrors are uncompromisingly brought to life.; And it's the daily difficulties of raising children under such extreme
conditions that makes this true-life saga so powerful.; Of all the films about The Troubles, Northern Ireland's 25+ year
politico-religious struggle with its neighbor from across the Irish Sea,
the newly-released ""Titanic Town"" brings the day-to-day horrors of a family
forced to cope with British occupation to the fore better than any other.; Walters delivers a witty, thoroughly engaging performance as Bernie, who
stumbles into a position as spokesperson by sheer accident.; Ultimately, despite its milieu of wide-scale violence and strife, it's a
film that works thanks to its small moments: avid reader Annie looking out
at the war in the streets with a gasp of, ""Agincourt!","There's also a
romantic angle involving Bernie's 16-year-old daughter Annie (nicely
played by newcomer Nuala O'Neill) that doesn't always feel connected to
the story as a whole, despite the framing structure of the story as
Annie's reminiscence of her mother's fame.; MPAA Rating:  Unrated (could be R for profanity, violence and adult
themes)
Running Time:  101 minutes.; In fact from the looks
of at least one particular foul-mouthed citizen, locking the
husbands out of the bedrooms might even be considered a
blessing by the menfolk.; There's unrealized potential in Aidan's
character, an ulcer-ridden man whose resentment of his infirmity bubbles
over into resentment of his wife's very public actions.; As Whittington, Davies' patronizing attitude toward
the energetic Bernie and her co-conspirator, Deirdre (Aingeal
Grehan) seems to go unnoticed by the petitioners."

sometimes it's one that has been remarked upon, like BRINGING UP BABY, and
sometimes it comes out of the blue.; It was picked for the ""Hollywood Code""
series due to its producer's ability to weave innuendo with innocence; in a
film that deals with a jewel thief's attempts to smuggle pearls, it's ironic to
see how Lubitsch smuggles Cooper into Dietrich's bedroom, and gets her off
scott-free at the end, even though she is definitely a con artist throughout
the film.; The following film concluded William K. Everson's ""Hollywood and the Code""
series.; It's a pleasure to watch -- it's clear that the two have been
sleeping together, but any attempts by the censorship board to bring it up
would have looked foolish; Lubitsch's genius is how he made it appear that the
censors had dirty minds!","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

83714.0,Angie,1998.0,"Geena Davis' performance as Angie is easily the best thing about
ANGIE, which is fine because it's also the most important thing.; A speech Angie makes to her baby surprised me by
suggesting that Angie believed her problem was thinking too much about
herself, when I felt she was thinking about herself for the first time
in her life.; The timing is good.; Ultimately, ANGIE feels like a ""greatest hits"" compilation from a
longer, stronger movie.; Like any
compilation, it's a pleasant experience even if none of the scenes,
good or not-so-good, ever tell us who Angie really is.","110 minutes ANGIE doesn't make a bit of sense.; NOTE:   I don't know what is a funnier example of ""intended audience.""; The second half of Todd Graff's script suffers from two major
problems.; Better bits include Angie
registering into the hospital as ""Angie Scotchandsoda"" and a
delivery-room scene complete with A CHORUS LINE.; The first is that it seriously overloads on emotional high
points."
83718.0,What Happened Was...,1998.0,"Both performances have impressive
authenticity.; Both performances have impressive
authenticity.; Luis Vera's MISS AMERIGUA is a good satiric comedy, at times quite
funny, that deserves release in the US.; THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT This is a film that has gotten a lot of favorable critical comment
and that is in large part because it is a nice pleasant enjoyable film
that takes no chances beyond those obvious in the premise.; It's a beautiful and sensitive performance, and Jackie's
genuineness provides a perfect counterpoint to Michael's intellectual
reserve, as he tries to maintain the upper hand through sarcasm without
even knowing it.","Noonan simply takes the scene too far;
children's voices whisper in the background, the camera shoots through
the windows of a dollhouse, and Sillas is lit with flickering candles
like a voodoo priestess.; Oh, it
will give you an endless source of conversational topics, all right,
but WHAT HAPPENED WAS... is almost guaranteed to warp your view of the
entire experience.; Unfortunately, it was
sub-titled in Dutch.; This is not to say the
message was wrong, but these were not very good arguments for their
point of view.; The printed
materials are poorly designed."
83795.0,Home for the Holidays,2000.0,"When she further became a
director, in the wonderful LITTLE MAN TATE, no one could deny that here
was someone very special.; Eccentric Aunt Glady is there, as
are Claudia's sister and brother-in-law and their children.; Mom (Anne Bancroft) and Dad (Charles Durning) a most loving
couple, are, as usual, the hosts.; It was difficult to warm up to the family
and the movie.; My having spent many years at family
gatherings at holidays, with Thanksgivings being the most memorable,
and all of them joyful, it was difficult to relate to HOME FOR THE
HOLIDAYS where holiday gatherings where close relatives attended every
year but wished they did not have to.","And through it all, much of the dialogue
(screenplay by W. D. Richter) seems as if most are speaking lines
rather than real-life talk.; With all that was going on, there was nothing exciting
to make me want to know what happened next.; Claudia Larson (Holly Hunter) has just been a victim of
""downsizing"" (what an ugly euphemism!); The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

84404.0,Bully,1996.0,"Based on a true story, though muted, in some way, by homogenizing the races 
of the actual participants, _Bully_ stars the alluring Seth Green-David 
Spade fusion Nick Stahl in the title role as the abusive, college-bound 
best friend of spacey surfer Marty (the frequently touching Brad Renfro, a 
co-producer).; But it is Clark's
uncompromised skewering of white bread Americana that makes Bully so
compelling.; Goetz
surprised them by pulling out a small pistol, putting a round into
each of the muggers.; If kids didn't
get the message, their parents sure couldn't miss it.; Marty, for years, has suffered under
this abusive friendship in a resigned, accepting way without striking back.","I'm about as far away 
from being a prude as you can [sic] but this movie just felt wrong.""; Neither side comes across well in this tome of teen angst as the
kids wander around, without a clue, drinking, smoking dope and screwing
indiscriminately.; The titled bully of the story in which
actual names are used, Bobby Kent (Nick Stahl), is not the
sweetest fella around though in fact he may be no worse than any
of the four screwdriver-carrying muggers who had a strange
encounter with Bernhard Goetz.; And
cheap thrills seem to be what the kids in this story crave.; He seems to leer 
on the actors for no reason at all and even the younger, often shirtless, 
boys like Marty's brother came across as victims of some kind of unseemly 
voyeurism and I felt dirty for being a part of it."
84926.0,Powder,1999.0,"Kudos to Goldsmith for a
wonderful score.; It requires a little commitment on the
viewer's part, but it's well worth it.; POWDER was completely unexpected: it's easily one of the
best films I've seen all year.; Once in awhile, Hollywood manages to surprise me with an
uncompromising film full of genuine emotion and enough to make you
really think.; But the rest of the film is amazing, and a terribly enjoyable trip.","What did need more care were the last three or four
minutes of the film, which just don't work.; In this entire film, Powder is
the only multi-dimensional personality.; None of this is religiously unorthodox, even to Christians.; The script has some problems.; For instance Jeff Goldblum's character is introduced
then disappears for thirty minutes."
85242.0,Underworld,1933.0,"It's not like the film noir of the
1940s, but more like a noir predecessor.; It
is also a visually challenging film, as Sternberg filled the screen with symbols
and imagery it had never seen before.; He discovers his deeper feelings, as
he decides to give himself up to the police.; Sternberg had a
different vision for the film and after the opening chaotic scenes were told
like a straight crime story, the director changed the reality of the silent film
and abandoned Hecht's version.; This works out fine, as Bull is even more successful than before
and becomes the uncrowned king of the Chicago underworld.","He wants to impress the
sexy Feathers that he doesn't care about money, as he's second fiddle to Bull in
this town and lusts after what Bull has--especially the Feathers dame.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

85545.0,Elles,,"You'll become close friends with your ex, and have romantic dinners
outside with him while you discuss your beautiful and accomplished grown
children.; The film is in French with English subtitles.; The
one scene depicting a fairly overt sexual encounter between
them is the most believable and heartwarming, particularly
when contrasted with the promiscuous Branca's fully clothed,
sordid-looking liaison with a fellow actor (where she is caught
by her flustered, drug-addicted daughter Rita).; Things are different in Europe.; If you're a woman who has been apprehensive lately about what your life
may be like after you reach your 40s and 50s, the motion picture ELLES
may provide just the perfect romantic fantasy for you.","A relationship between a
45-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man might attract just
a few stares, though gray-haired European men are probably
not unlike Americans in their ardor for rosy-cheeked women
in college.; Not very.; The idea that older people, or even
those in their forties and fifties have love lives or exist for any
reason other than to nurture their offspring is alien to each
generation of pre- and post-pubescent youngsters.; Granted
none of this is very credible, but, hey, audiences deserve their dreams.; It is
not rated but would be an R for sex, nudity, profanity and one drug
usage scene and would be fine for older and mature teenagers."
85588.0,Dadetown,1999.0,"Hexter gets into the 
minds of the residents, and the candid nature of some of his interviews 
is amazing.; Everyone buys their groceries at the same small store, and the Mayor is 
on a first-name basis with each of his constituents.; DADETOWN is the most thought-provoking examination of the collapse 
of a community since ROGER AND ME.; Hexter
has thrown open a look at all the social, political, and economic
factors involved in the evolution of a small town, and he has done a
nice job in showing the human tragedy above all else as being the most
important thing to consider, even though in the bigger picture things
might look like they are working out, there's still a face you have to
put on someone who loses his job.; DADETOWN's most startling surprise is reserved for 
them.","To make
matters worse, the aim of API is to do away with the need for paper
products, which happens to be the exact opposite business aim of

85998.0,Hanuman,1997.0,"Hanuman is the revered monkey god of Hindu mythology, and this film is
a reflection of the anthropomorphic deity in the fact that his spirit
is examined, and also by the fact that many of the primary characters
in the film literally are monkeys.; This film was screened at Cinequest 10, the San Jose film festival.; Eventually, the two kindred spirits cross paths.; When Tom
discovers that the artwork of the temple is being looted for profit,
he impulsively decides to travel to India to continue his father's
inquiries and to hopefully try to end the plundering of the
antiquities.; One is among monkeys that live
near the temple, and the other is in the human world.","The
insipid human-based plot demonstrates the ugly result of mixing bad
acting with bad writing.; It is unimaginable that a performance could
be worse than the one given by Cavanaugh.; Voluminous footage must have been shot and painstakingly
edited.; It feels as if a story was developed
with only monkeys, but the extra human plot was tacked on to make it
reach a desired running length.; The storyline
following the monkeys is consistently cute and entertaining, whereas
the storyline following the humans is poorly written, horribly acted,
and completely unimaginative."

promising cinema debut for Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton - with all 
its plot holes it might have been a good idea for them to push style

glitches, most obviously that by the time the bodies start piling up
(and there=92s way too many for such a weak motive) there=92s not a lot of

convoluted exposition scene with Charlotte Rampling that for all

the neccessity for Meg Ryan=92s character."
86681.0,To Die for,1990.0,"The telling of the story starts very strong and its jibes are both
on target and laugh-out-loud funny.; The film is in large part a portrait

pompous and clueless woman with the personality of a spider.; Standing out considerably more
are Illeana Douglas and especially Dan Hedaya as Larry's sister and
father.; Eventually we start seeing the
pieces of the story in flashback.; Both families had misgivings over the
marriage, but Larry is awestruck by the china-doll beauty and Suzanne
is hard to say no to.","The screen has had a lot of smart and beautiful but cold and
calculating women.; She spouts naive pop-philosophy and empty

88174.0,Whispers in the Dark,1999.0,"The end revelation of the killer's 
identity is a considerable surprise - one where the cast member in 
question plays notably against type.; Crowe holds one right from his 
opening which is constructed as a romance.; Crowe also 
manages to quite believably and without contrivation turn most of the 
principal cast into suspects.; Here the softness of Crowe's 
touch and the deftness of his writing immediately absorbs one in the 
film.; Crowe then propels one through a sharply plotted series of rug 
pulling twists - the revelation that patient Unger's fantasy man is the 
same one Sciorra is seeing; detective La Paglia's games with Sciorra as 
to how much he knows all along; and the whole dance of doubt as to 
whether love interest Sheridan is or isn't the killer.","Christopher Crowe is a director/writer who has kicked around the 
thriller genre for more than a decade now, turning out scripts for films

88566.0,Twelfth Night: Or What You Will,1995.0,"The acting is superb.; Granted
TWELFTH NIGHT is a much more traditional rendition, but ROMEO AND
JULIET is much more involving and fun even if it is a romantic tragedy
recast into a comedic farce.; TWELFTH NIGHT is an adaptation of Shakespeare's bittersweet
romantic comedy about shipwrecked siblings, mistaken identities,
and, of course, true love.; Mel Smith is delightfully boisterous as the 
drunk and disorderly Sir Toby.; Finally, it provides
an opportunity to consider, or reconsider, an ostensibly light-hearted
play that nevertheless continues to reveal hidden depths of the human
heart in a series of small epiphanies.","Feste, one
of Olivia's servants and resident clown, wanders in and out of the
proceedings, alternately making trouble and dispensing wisdom.; However, it fails to exploit the inherent
comedy of the situation, and one would expect more, particularly from
a cast of such calibre given such source material.; The most interesting and outlandish acting is done by Nigel
Hawthorne (THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE) as Malvolio.; Despite a cast with impressive credentials, the end result is
a dreary film, punctuated with stacattos of bemusement.; The film
lacks A-list star power, and will likely not generate the raving
word-of-mouth required to convert this film into a mainstream hit."
88611.0,Laura,1995.0,"""Laura"" is a highly entertaining murder mystery.; What made this a special film, a classic, was how stylishly smart it was
and the magnificent performances of both Andrews and Webb.; The movie is available on tape but not yet on DVD.; Gene Tierney is on my all-time 
list of gorgeous movie ladies, a very classy lady.; But pictorial effects contribute most to making LAURA
a true classic (more so on the big screen than in video).","After seeing Price ham it up in endless horror movies, he
appears miscast playing a hearthrob.; How silly.; Films don't 
move masses.; In one of the movie's unintentionally funny scenes,
he turns two enormous spotlights on a suspect during an interrogation.; He gets more screen time than anyone, but
only has third billing."
88863.0,Caught Up,1939.0,"CAUGHT UP is a good vehicle for actor Bokeem Woodbine to strut his
stuff, and he shows admirable versatility in portraying anger, fear, and
grief.; In many ways, I was reminded of PALMETTO, although CAUGHT UP is 
certainly more graphic and lurid (this film contains a lot of sex, 
nudity, and bloodshed).; The ReelViews web site: http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/ ""No art passes our conscience in the way film does, and goes directly to our
feelings, deep down into the dark rooms of our souls"" The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Writer/director Darin Scott does two things to make CAUGHT UP 
different from countless other African American-oriented films cut from 
the same cloth.; The story builds as if there will be a showdown between Darryl
and the psycho Ahmad.","Plus, 
he mumbles much of his cliché-riddled dialogue.; His co-star, Cynda 
Williams, isn't much better.; The sole purpose of one inept character, a supercilious white guy 
(Joseph Lindsey), is comic relief (although he's more annoying than 
funny).; The second, which 
is not a good idea, is to employ a series of preposterous plot twists 
that no one in their right mind will buy.; Sadly, that's a term that also applies to sections of the wildly uneven 
script."
89861.0,Stiff Upper Lips,1996.0,"Horace, in turn,
introduces Agnes to the joys of extra large bathtubs, probably the
funniest jibe on youth oriented period pieces.; He does fine as both a judge, stiffly explaining British law to a
congregation of Indian subjects in a courtroom, and as a
suitor to Aunt Agnes--rounding out a happy ending for all in
which each character finds the person who is just made for
him or her.; Georgina
Cates is drop-dead gorgeous as usual and Prunella Scales
furthers her reputation as one of England's top character
actresses.; Only Peter Ustinov, as a cranky, eccentric Indian tea plantation owner, and Frank Finlay, as the genteel family's aging butler, achieve their poker-faced comedy objectives.; The story revolves around Edward (Samuel West) who takes a fellow Cambridge undergrad, Cedric (Robert Portal) home to ""Ivory's End"" to meet his tightly-corseted sister Emily (Georgina Cates), hoping it might be a suitable match.","Instead, there is a series
of desperately unfunny scenes, which don't deserve a description.; Emily wants to marry whom she chooses while her
more ""responsible"" aunt wants her to marry someone of the
right social class, specifically the boring stick, Cedric Trilling
(Robert Portal).; The film attempts to emulate the Carry On movies, but fails miserably,
since it lacks the sense of fun and cheekiness of that series.; Peter Ustinov, Prunella Scales and Sean Pertwee make complete fools
of themselves in this unbelievably feeble comedy.; How utterly useless!"

91937.0,Topsy-Turvy,1999.0,"This is
fun, energetic, and at times exciting, bravo Gilbert and Sullivan, I give you a
standing ovation.; This 160-minute musical epic (just right in length--the film was never
dull for a second), moves at its own very satisfying speed, enhanced by
the magnificent musical arrangements of Carl Davis and replete with many
hilarious episodes (it's a very funny film).; ""Topsy-Turvy"" is a lot of fun, especially for those with something of an 
appreciation for the works of Gilbert and Sullivan.; Broadbent is
especially effective, funny when he needs to be but also human and
affecting.; Although the music may not be to the tastes of today's younger
audiences, the wonderful re-enactments of several scenes from The
Mikado are splendid stuff.","Rethinking all the film's good qualities, though, leaves me even more 
perplexed at what on earth was going on during its first hour, which is a 
pointless, dreary waste of time made even worse by the fact that my watch was 
broken.; Unfortunately, everything prior to this point, some two hours of
admittedly grand-looking screen time, has been dull as plainsong, tra la la
on one note.; Even at 160 minutes, the film
never seems tedious; it does, however, seem unnecessarily meandering.; This is the same Gilbert who calls his mother ""the vicious
woman who bore me into this ridiculous
world.""; There's a middle section with tepid musical
numbers from The Sorcerer that gets quite tedious."
91972.0,M,1990.0,"You can chalk ""M"" up as a lasting masterpiece, created with a passion
for detail and a successful transitional film from the silents to the
talkies, taking into its mise en scene the best of both those worlds.; It's
a universal story because things like this still happen today, when one
person is seen as the one to die for everyone's anger.; This is one of the most incredible films to
have emerged out of inter-war Germany, and if you get the all too rare
opportunity to see the movie take it.; In one of the best parallel action sequences I've ever seen,
Lang shows the mafiasos discussing their plans as well as the police's
plans, and both seem eerily similar (even though they're marginally
different).; Lorre's performance 
is outstanding - his portrayal of the truly multidimensional - 
his inability to see himself as anything other than a victim 
makes him seem even more evil.","""M"" was restored last year after being released on video in a murky,
screwed-up version filled with bad sub-titles and unwatchable scenes.; The
police take fingerprints from a letter the killer wrote the newspaper,
they have a psychologist profile the killer as someone who is a
pathological sex pervert, and they note the type of pencil he used, the
brand of cigarettes he smoked, and the type of wood table he used to
write on.; In contrast, Lohmann (the police 
inspector) is sloppily dressed, drinks and smokes too much, and 
exhibits the characteristics normally associated with a movie 
villain.; The criminal fraternity sees a wide distinction between
themselves and this ""monster"", though Schraenker has killed three men
at least.; Both movies featured 
a monster, and scared audiences but in each case, the monster 
conformed to conventional mythology - it looked terribly scary 
and had an inhuman conception."
93440.0,Hush,1998.0,"The romance between the two young
lovers, she being witty and intelligent, and he being a handsome

about the Schaech character being too dumb for his own good, I think he
is actually quite effective (I will explain later).; Her
wiseacre character is hilarious and adds a lot of humor that could have
been used more throughout the film.; Lange
has a great time with her and shows that she can chew the scenery with the
best of them.; Despite this, HUSH is
surprisingly effective, boasting good performances from the cast, and
keeping it real enough to be semi-scary.","The movie is just poorly made.; A character
that could have been simply awful is merely groan-worthy.; It
is a bad film.; The rest is your basic uninspired fodder.; That's 
not the case with really bad thrillers like this, which fail to generate

works and note that ""everybody steals from everybody"" right before a
clever homage of Reservoir Dogs and Goodfellas.; His friends may not be the most sympathetic 
characters, but Mike's a likable guy.; Because it's so fun to watch and the fact that I laughed hysterically 
numerous times (and the fact that the published screenplay has a 
glossary for the terms in the back), I highly reccomend ""Swingers"" as 
one of the best films of last year.","Embarrassingly bad.; And worse.; Actually, the Starbuck's thing gets even worse.; Whenever he meets a girl, he

boy, Ollie, at the heart of the controversy.; Bould has many memorable moments -- hiding under a
work bench so that Frank won't find him, preparing to defend himself
with a chisel, and bravely enduring the punishment that Frank dishes
out.","At least the filmmakers made no
secret that Frank, Hannah's boyfriend, is a violent child abuser.; On the
first front, cries of ""TV-movie"" amount to utter nonsense.; Films like this defy
characterization.; The same problem lies in the climax of the film that is too
convenient and too easy.; Pope tries to make up for that
lack of spark by providing a big court-room scene where HOLLOW REED begins

it results in an enjoyable experience.; The challenging story, which asks thought-provoking and provocative
questions, is willing to tackle difficult subjects in surprising ways.; The comedy works because
the excellent ensemble cast takes it dead seriously, and the drama works
better because of the comedic relief.; The darkly comedic
first part is followed by a shockingly dramatic second, each fascinating
in its own right, but both better together.","This could have been a problem if the film was not so
entertaining.; ), the bored students know that they can get away with
absolutely anything.; The approach taken by Walmsley will be jarring to many
viewers, and director Andy Anderson states that it is meant to be
comically disturbing.; Parents threaten litigation in response to attempts at discipline.; Mr. Walmsley, a first-time substitute goes to unruly Donner High in

makes the movie so enjoyable.; The cast is brilliant.; Is it really about Kitty
and Levin and their conventional marriage?","There is no doubt the film suffers from far too much editing.; Even with luminaries like Greta Garbo and 
Vivien Leigh in the title role, the stripped-down story has barely 
resembled its inspiration, looking instead like an overplotted, costume 
melodrama.; Rose's brave-but-disappointing attempt reinforces this

97406.0,Georgia,1999.0,"It may be a movie about family rivalry in the music world, but this
ain't The Judds.; With the amount of dysfunctionality in GEORGIA, The
Jackson Five is a little more like it.; Sadie (Jennifer Jason
Leigh) is the pariah of the family (and is much more interesting)--a
strung-out heroin addict with a voice more reminiscent of Johnny Rotten
than Joan Baez and who has a penchant for hacking up cover songs.; Sadie can't keep a steady gig (not even the local bowling alley), so
she grudgingly turns to sister Georgia for help.; GEORGIA (Mare Winningham) is the older of two singing sisters, one of
those talented ultra-folky types with a huge following and who sings songs
with choruses like ""No more haaaaaard tiiiiiiimes.""","The melodramatics here are
shameful, not because they're over-emotional, but because they're just
dull.; This is supposed to
show us the bared and tortured soul of Sadie, but instead it reveals
merely that those movie theater seats are damn uncomfortable.; While GEORGIA starts strong, hinting at what could have been a
cathartic showdown between the two sisters, the film whimpers off into
lifeless boredom after about half an hour.; So unless you're just dying to hear Velvet Underground tunes played
(badly) at bar mitzvahs, I'd recommend keeping this GEORGIA off your mind.; Sadie's big
finish is an 8 1/2-minute (note to director: *bad* idea) rendition of Van
Morrison's ""Take Me Back"" in front of 2000 listeners."

visually more appealing than in many other movies.; The protagonist of this film is Will Randall (played by Jack
Nicholson), publishing executive from New York who is
currently experiencing plenty of disappointments in his
life.; Some of the best roles in Jack Nicholson's career were those
of men whose willingness to break the rules or succumb to
irrational urges made them look satanic compared to ""normal""
people.; So, the role of book editor who is slowly turning
into werewolf was perfect for Nicholson and he plays it with
gusto.; Nichols puts a lot of effort into
production design and other details, trying to make the
story about lycathropy in New York publishing circles as
realistic as possible, using the classic horror scenario as
the basis for interesting, thought-provoking drama about
inter-office politics, midlife crisis and eternal struggle
between civilisation and irrational urges in individual
humans.","Slow-motion shots of
Nicholson as werewolf are overlong, and Ennio Morricone's
score is again quite irritating.; So, when even when he tried to make something
different with WOLF, his 1994 horror film, I greeted that
effort without any sort of enthusiasm.; To make things even worse, Randall's wife
Charlotte (played by Kate Nelligan) is having an affair.; The author of this review is supposed to worship, or at
least respect Mike Nichols as one of the great American
filmmakers, but he can't.; Unfortunately, all those elements go down the drain when
Nichols decides to wrap the story up with cheap horror
cliches and even cheaper murder subplots."
98566.0,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,1996.0,"The most important thing to learn from
this article is that the movie is well worth seeing, at least if you like the
comic book.; Overall, I was quite impressed with the movie.; This is a faithful adaptation of
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES, a well-done movie, and all-in-all a great way
to spend a couple of hours.; The
technical expertise on display in the turtles' (and Splinter's) suits is
still impressive now, eight years later.; They are hilarious because of the way
the turtles fight, using household objects and all the while exclaiming
wisecracks and one-liners.","The movie industry has made yet another attempt to portray
""inscrutable oriental wisdom,"" and they've failed yet again.; Most importantly, this is *not* a movie aimed only
at 5-year-olds.; Unintentional comedy there, I'd
say.; The movie just never finds its
niche.; However, neither of these things is obnoxiously
handled."

cheesy, tacked on mystery; and a horrible, poorly written script.; However, Cleaver is disgusting in

the betterment of the lives of prostitutes through proper health care.; The film also provides your one opportunity to say 
to someone, the ticket seller in this case, ""I'd like Live Nude Girls, 
please."""

100975.0,Just Looking,1995.0,"The story is there, too: It's a delightful film with some
tender and thoughtful moments, being an altogether witty, funny,
charming, and intelligent look at adolescence and growing up.; Joseph Franquinha is ideal as Lenny's uncle, and
Ryan Merriman does a great job of stumbling through the clumsy but
inevitable stages of adolescence.; But his innocent curiosity ends up
getting him caught and his mother (Patti LuPone) and stepfather decide
to ship him off to ""the country"" (also known as the Bronx) where he
meets a new set of friends who just happen to share a similar interest.; Overall, Just Looking has perfect casting all the way
through.; This is a timeless coming of
age comedy that will ring as true for the teens of today as it will for
their baby boomer Moms and Dads.","Well, everything save the cheesiest lightning 
storm this side of an Ed Wood movie.; Rated R.  Running time: 97 minutes.; The opportunity to turn their dry discussions into a laboratory course 
comes in the person of a fetching young adult named Hedy (Gretchen Mol).; This is a diminutive movie that could have barely fit on an
old 19 inch TV tube or on an off-Broadway stage but despite
its attributes appears lost on the big screen.; It is rated R for sexual content and language 
and would be acceptable for teenagers."
101860.0,Go Tigers!,2000.0,"It's loaded
with action, packed with spirit, full of itself, and deserving of the
accolades it won when it appeared at the Sundance Festival.; Carlson, a native of the town of
Massillon, Ohio (population 33,000 but said to have one of the
country's best football squads), is in love with the sport, with the
school, with the community of steel-town blue-collar workers and
its culture.; Massillon is an integrated municipality.; (In fact, this MTV-style photography was my only
objection to the picture, and it's not a minor irritant.); Well, I must admit, this school is homogeneous, or if
not, Mr. Carlson sure has a way of editing out dissension.","One would think that I, having taught high
school English and Social Studies and in the afternoon coaching
nothing more athletic than the Drama Club would be a big
Rickover fan, but no.; (Even I was told several times,
and by the swimming coach for pete's sake, to pass some
sloooooooooooooooooooooow kids in Social Studies so that they
could remain on the team.); is anything but a talking heads doc.; Directing
photographer Curt Apduhan--who uses a pair of Hi Def units
shooting simultaneously (for the techies, that's Arri SR-3 super
16mm film cameras for selected games and Sony's High
definition HDW-700A)--he cuts and dissolves rapidly as though
the team's effervescence were not in itself enough to infect the
audience.; jumps from pep rallies featuring an array of
miniskirted girls to quite a large band led by a military-style
leader--who evoke a professional sound, I must say--then cuts to
not just one but a bevy of coaches who harangue the squad
when they're behind (in one season they end up with a 4-6
record and are in the dumps), informing the young men that the
other side have bigger balls than they."
102066.0,Saving Grace,1949.0,"Yet, it wasn't until one of the last scenes
that I saw Spot, in the form of one of Mia's girlfriends.; The two soon see this as a possibly big business
opportunity, as Grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to
be high-quality stuff.; The scenery
was beautiful, the actors comfortable in their roles, and the writing
was fairly tight (though I found myself lost at times, trying to compare
British/metric measures to the ones we silly Yanks use.; ""Spot
the Spot"" is a pasttime The Diva and a friend hipped me to (and that I
wasn't very comfortable with at first).; It is filled with
likable establishment types living in a quaint town, such as tolerant
vicars and policemen, plenty of eccentrics, and of locals who stick
together through thick and thin.","This 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that
smoking and growing pot is silly, but should be tolerated as something
naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands
must do in order not to remain destitute.; The film is tolerable until after
its first hour, it then falls completely apart, becoming just too absurd
to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas.; Things work out in a
ridiculous way, where there is a total breakdown in the character
development of Grace, where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely
a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood.; All those caveats aside, the folks involved with SAVING GRACE looked
like they were having a bowl...er, a ball.; The same could be
said about much of the rest of the cast, especially Martin Clunes as the
dopey doc; and when his character uttered the line (paraphrased) ""Why is
marijuana illegal, yet the drug alcohol, is not?"
103162.0,Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth,1999.0,"The interviews with Honey, his friends, his lawyer (Garbus) and
outspoken mother, all say that he was someone who was deteriorating
rapidly as he fought the court system during the last two years of his
life.; The truth is better than what we concoct.; It also reminds me personally of my friend
Ronald G. Shafer's documentary Donald Hall and Jane Kenyon: ""Keeping you
Safe Beside Me"", about the tragic death of poet Jane Kenyon.; While at the beauty
parlor, she is interviewed for the film, filling us in with a more
complete look at Lenny, as she provided anecdotes, snapshots and home
films of him and recalled how he was a quiet child who could have fits
of melancholy, but was a happy-go-lucky person most of the time.; His battle with the courts is a heartbreaking story of injustice.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

103600.0,Dream Lover,1997.0,"It's brilliant; a real surprise.; Their scenes together are sexy and believable and
well-performed.; Overall, though, what's here
makes for a serviceable little erotic mystery that is marvelous to look
at.; He's
hooked.; However, DREAM LOVER is definitely film worth
watching and one of the most underated 1990s thrillers.","It could've been executed more successfully; Director Kazan
would perhaps have had a better film on his hands having wiped out a
few of the dream sequences in translation of script to screen; the
sequences are excessive and pointless (there are four long ones), and
one too many uninvolving scenes linger.; And as he
unpieces parts of her hidden life, his mental state gets worse and
worse.; Two actors never looked this
good in a movie.; This kind of talk might be especially appealing to the psychopaths in the
audience.; Instead of steamy sex we get
absurd plot contrivances of how manipulative she is and how she gets the law to
back her in her quest to take Spader's money."
103665.0,Firelight,1998.0,"The very next evening, Elisabeth
has shed the last article of protective clothing and has begun
to enjoy her new, albeit temporary, job.; William Nicholson, who both scripted and helms the lush
bodice-ripper, is known for his creation of ""Shadowlands"" and
has a background with BBC for restrained dramas.; Yes, these are all easily guessed, but the beauty of 
FIRELIGHT is that it still radiates a special magic in its presentation.; Yet throughout, Charles and Elisabeth
seem in denial, refusing to admit their mutual infatuation.; The best and most touching scene comes when Louisa realizes that 
her teacher is her mother.","The
problems of mushy productions are customarily unoriginal, the
conclusions predictable.; It's like a screen
version of a paperback Harlequin romance.; He just wants her to 
be happy, and disciplining her seems cruel to him.; It is rated R for sex, nudity and brief 
profanity and would be fine for teenagers.; The surrogate mother must not know his name or
habitation in this anonymous transaction."
103974.0,Junior,1998.0,"***  = Excellent show.; It is cast with great people, and it had
terrific trailers.; Finally, James Newton Howard's effective score
pulls all the right heart-strings.; Emma Thompson, who has proven herself adept at both comedy and
drama, is very likable and funny as the socially limited, Dr.  Reddin.; Schwarzenegger and
DeVito are two of my favorite actors in film today, and Ivan Reitman is one
of the more talented directors in Hollywood.","*    = Poor show.; Anything would have been better than this mess.; The problem is that the trite script fails to
capitalize on opportunities, relying instead on worn-out cliches and
jokes that are, for the most part, unfunny (there are a few notable
exceptions--I do admit to laughing a few times).; 0    = One of the worst films of this or any year.; The only good thing about JUNIOR is Emma Thompson, but she's far
from sufficient to save the film."
104530.0,Gravesend,1999.0,"Stabile's percipient
reflection on Zane, the show's hothead, is one of the best.; That's JoJo the Junkie (Macky Aquilino in a beautiful
performance).; Unlike painting and literature, the cinema both gives to life
and takes from it..."" The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Tarantino's dialogue is a 
pleasure to listen to -- there's rhythm and style to the way the words 
are pieced together.; There are scenes when Parducci, Malloy, 
and Brandise hit their stride, but it doesn't happen often enough.","Unfortunately, because of script deficiencies and bad 
choices (such as an ill-advised voiceover narrative), there aren't 
enough of those moments for this film to climb out of the continuum of 
""life on the streets"" movie mediocrity.; Presenting at film
festivals and trying to connect with key people in the film industry
are fledgling filmmaker's equivalent of buying lottery tickets.; The aspect that undermines GRAVESEND isn't the camerawork or the 
director's touch, but Stabile's script, which is uninvolving and 
repetitive, and features a quartet of ill-developed characters.; The surprisingly
professional acting is marred by the script's lack of focus and
direction.; GRAVESEND also features a significant quantity of banal, profane 
dialogue."
106207.0,Sea People,1996.0,"This is an unusually charming fable, a real winner that I highly
recommend for family viewing.; As their friendship deepens, the MacRaes reveal

106837.0,Different for Girls,1997.0,"**** Amazing, potent stuff.; Terrific closure.; Chance brings the two together, and love,
such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky British romantic comedy, 
is what this skewed little story is largely about.; In its own way, DIFFERENT 
FOR GIRLS asks many of the same questions about gender and sexuality as 
Frank Oz' IN AND OUT, and, unsurprisingly, the answers are the same.; What's refreshing about their relationship is that Prentice, for all his
rudeness and crudeness, is so accepting of Kim.","But this doesn't
either, since even Mrs Doubtfire is sexier than Steven Mackintosh's Kim
Foyle, and as either sex, he's just plainly a simpering wanker nobody
should like.; Writer Marchant's brushstrokes are far too broad: Prentice is rough-edged,
Kim is refined and softly-spoken (although in most scenes her masculinity
is as obvious as a five o'clock shadow).; DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS comes up with a
promising enough proposition, but does nothing that surpasses the
merely workmanlike with it.; A voyeuristically uncomfortable scene, in which Prentice asks to see Kim's
surgically-altered body for himself, comes across as gratuitous rather than
pivotal, as if seeing a naked transsexual formed the initial conceit behind
this film.; I'd rather 
enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft-
hearted transsexual love story."
107087.0,Monolith,1955.0,"In one of the episodes, its
narrator, Carl Sagan, made an interesting experiment.; Of course,
Tucker and Flynn decide to investigate further, and they
find a lot of violent incidents in the city - incidents
involving some malevolent alien force, capable of taking
over human bodies.; Review written on September 11th 1999 The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Tucker (played by Bill Paxton) and Terri Flynn (played by
Lindsay Frost) are pair of tough LAPD detectives that are
investigating the murder of a small boy.; The plot, like so many of them, takes place in Los Angeles.","Unfortunately, the authors of MONOLITH
didn't watch this particular episode, otherwise they
wouldn't make a movie so utterly disappointing like this
one.; The
screenplay by Steven Lister is awful - it simply doesn't
connect the dots between obligatory action scenes, the
characters are unappealing and wooden, and the plot contains
wholes with the size of Nebraska.; Of course, there are some
huge implausibilities (like organisation called Department
of Historical Research taking over murder suspects from
LAPD) that look like an insult to viewer's intelligence.; Some action scenes look
interesting, but a lot of pyrotechnics and special effects
won't change the verdict on this film - MONOLITH is failed
film that should be avoided.; Like Sagan, they had interesting elements for
interesting SF action thriller- good, or at least, capable
actors; good special effects; few interesting action scenes
- but they failed to connect them into coherent film."
107785.0,Bitter Sweet,1997.0,"The leading actresses are excellent in this film:both  Anna Neagle (as
Sarah, Marchioness of Shane [the Peggy Wood role] sings ""Í'll See You again""
and the duet ""Dear Little Cafe'') and Ivy St Helier [as Manon, La Crevette]
who gives a heart rending performance of Noel Coward's classic ''If Love
were all'' are superb.; This film  of ""Bitter Sweet"" was very popular with audiences in 1933, and is
in many ways preferable to the MGM Hollwood version, which Noel Coward,
incidentally hated.; A Review by Roger Mellor
Bitter Sweet (1933 Film)
Produced and Directed by Herbert Wilcox for British and Dominions Noel Coward's musical weepie was first produced at Her Majesty's Theatre
London in 1929, and later in the same year New York (Ziegfield Theatre) with
Evelyn Laye.; Still, it is a fascinating effort.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Unimaginatively directed by Herbert Wilcox, the film only really comes to
life in  the cafe
scenes, where I think one can attribute any visual flair [such as the
tracking shot on the bottle on
the waiter's tray at the lead in to ''Tokay''] to the cameraman, Freddie
Young (the same Freddie Young who went on to photograph ''Lawrence of
Arabia''  thirty years later), especially as Wilcox, coming from the a
business/distribution background, was renowned within the industry for an
almost complete lack of knowledge of the technicalities of film making (such
as where to place the camera......).; Hugh Williams makes an impression, however, in an
incisive cameo role in the prologue and epilogue scenes.; The men are much weaker (and Fernand Graavey as Carl, the music teacher,
gives  a particularly
feeble performance).; After a well filmed opening scene set in 1930s [the
""modern'' tailpieces feature the contemporary dance music of Lew Stone and
his band]  there follows  a dully filmed static dialogue scene in  long
takes between Sarah and Carl.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

107987.0,Amy Fisher: My Story,2001.0,"This film was
very well done and even if very little is actual fact, I enjoyed

Buttafucco.; Her
performance as Amy Fisher was completely convincing, and the backbone to
the film.; AMY FISHER: MY STORY is the first of three television films that

with this film, the other two networks ABC, with BEYOND CONTROL: THE AMY
FISHER STORY starring Drew Barrymore, and CBS, with CASUALTIES OF LOVE:
THE 'LONG ISLAND LOLITA' STORY starring Alyssa Milano, will be airing
theirs on the same night a week after NBC ran this film.","She evidently had more bad habits than the film showed, but
the film might have been trying to be nice to her (it is giving her side
of the story).; The film is supposedly based on facts

affair with, in the end, will have Fisher attempting to kill Joe
Buttafucco's wife so she can have Joe to herself."
108401.0,Star Maps,1991.0,"While I can't think of another film that covers all of the ground 
traversed by STAR MAPS, the film frequently ventures into territory that 
was examined more effectively by such diverse offerings as MY FAMILY, 
ONCE WERE WARRIORS, and JOHNS.; Unlike painting and literature, the cinema both gives to life
and takes from it..."" The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; When one 
of Carlos' customers, Jennifer (Kandeyce Jorden), an actress on a soap 
opera, tells him she will get him a gig on her show, Carlos begins to 
think everything is turning up for him, but his father has different 
plans for him.; Flores, as Carlos' sister, gives a strong and poignant performance as a 
young woman who longs for a relationship but does not want to leave her 
ailing mother.; Pepe lives a 
life of lies, and it's rare that he tells anyone the truth -- not his 
wife, his children, or his mistress, Letti (Annette Murphy), whom he 
keeps on a string with promises of an eventual marriage.","Unfortunately, perhaps because first time 
writer/director Miguel Arteta is attempting to tackle too many issues, 
or because he doesn't have a good feel for anything below the surface, 
much of this movie comes across as shallow and melodramatic.; Somewhere in
STAR MAPS are a few interesting ideas, but Arteta forces viewers to wade
through a swamp of muddled exposition and amateurish film-making, then
doesn't offer them a map to get out again.; For the most part, the acting is amateurish, which is 
disappointing, although not surprising, considering the film's low 
budget.; Even
more than by its rambling script, STAR MAPS is thwarted by Arteta's
inability to put together a remotely professional production.; Because of this, there is not nearly enough time with any of the 
stories, and it eventually comes off feeling empty."
109264.0,This Is Elvis,1999.0,"Released some five years after his death, ""This is Elvis""
attempts to explain the rise and fall of Elvis Presley.; A powerful,
emotive singer with good looks, he was became by far
the most successful recording artist of the 1950s.; kollers@mpsi.net

rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; He married and divorced
Priscilla Presley.; He remains
famous today, not so much for his performances, but
for the tragedy of his late career.","He starred in a series
of movies that became worse and worse, then resurrected
his career with a television special leading to a
series of concert tours.; Also, the frequent
interchanging of fake and real Elvii becomes distracting.; While his cultural impact comes across, as does his
ability as an entertainer, this film will not in itself
convince anybody that Elvis was the greatest American
singer (which he probably was).; The Elvisian narration was by Ray Donner, who in 1961
had a top twenty pop hit covering Elvis' ""The Girl of My
Best Friend"".; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

109461.0,Drop Squad,1997.0,"To its credit, DROP SQUAD presents an effective case for the means
favored by those on both sides of the dispute.; The accuracy and familiarity of what *should be*
ludicrous lampoons is startling.; Given the way
things develop, it's clear which side is winning the debate.; Much of
Bruford's life is portrayed with an edge that often verges on open
parody--he is less an individual than a representation of those of his
race in corporate America who have become boot-lickers.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","The depiction
of Bruford's condescending commercials (one of which includes a
self-deprecating appearance by executive producer Spike Lee) are
viciously on-target.; Her evidence:  Bruford
works at a white-owned advertising agency developing cynical and
demeaning commercials designed to sell cheap and potentially-
destructive products (such as Mumblin' Jack Malt Liquor and General
Otis Fried Chicken's ""Gospel Pak"") to blacks.; The film veers off course during the actual deprogramming
sequences, which look like something out of Oliver Stone's bloated
NATURAL BORN KILLERS.; The
heavy-handed sermonizing feels more like a force-feeding than something
willingly- consumed.; Considering that this fundamental
question lies at the heart of deprogramming, it's odd to find a film
whose only acknowledgement of the subject comes as a throwaway line."
109525.0,Pariah,1985.0,"It is this bleak ending that carries the film's most powerful
message: the message that, despite what you may be able to momentarily
do to put your own mind to rest, evil will still be with us (and in many
forms) and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it
entirely.; BRAVO!; Pariah is an explosive realistic look at the world of ""Skinheads"".; Wilson's
character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly.; Damon Jones and Dave Owen
Ward stand out in their portrayal of skinhead and avenger.","Raldolph Kret does not motivate these sickos.; The performers are
charged up throughout, giving us in the audience barely a
moment to reflect on what's going on, but then again, the
characters in this movie are probably clueless themselves
about their motivations.; The main character
Steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek
out revenge.; Randolph Kret's script, based on two real life incidents that affected
not only his life but the life of the film's producer Shaun Hill, is an
affront on violence and intolerance.; There is not a single likable character in the film."
109673.0,Sneakers,2000.0,"Analysis: Great throwaway lines, good twists and turns,
edge-of-your-seat at times, but a little self-indulgent, especially at
the end (think TERMINATOR 2).; Minor flaws and serious considerations of
our eroding rights aside, however, SNEAKERS was a fun movie with some
cool scenes/tricks to cheer at, certainly an enjoyable ride.; This works very well for Sneakers.; All the actors are believable in their roles, and there is
plenty of humor going around.; :-) Score/Sound: good varied soundtrack, also good sound FX.","At least they bothered to hire
        a technical advisor.; It
is also, in all likelihood, nonsense and pointless at the end.; One unbelievable item is the skimpy $175,000 accepted by Redford's
security penetration (read ""tiger team"") consulting company for a
record-breaking information security project.; Violence/Gore: some bullets flying, a couple of dead bodies (no gore),
a few fights and slugs.; Let's just say the character has a room filled with body heat and motion
detectors."
109928.0,Phoenix,1999.0,"It's a film Liotta
saw a 100 times.; He also talks about the great bluesman Robert Johnson
and of Dostoyevsky being a compulsive gambler.; The film ends in a
violent shootout and Harry throwing his badge on the floor while on the
run, but not before he squares all his debts and takes care of all those
who screwed him.; Her
affair with his boss (Xander R. Berkeley) in the police department, is
the most deadly one.; Dennis Schwartz: ""Ozus' World Movie Reviews"" © ALL RIGHTS RESERVED   DENNIS SCHWARTZ The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","The film has nothing to say that makes sense, the acting was
forgettable, the dialogue was trite, and all the characters seemed to be
out to lunch.; James
(Baldwin) plays sleazy jokes on his pals and is corrupt.; They all have a bad attitude about
their jobs and they're all sleazebags.; In imitation of Pulp Fiction, there's lots of frivolous talk.; But the film turns even nastier, as a series
of double-crosses take place and it becomes clear that the rogue cops
have different reasons for pulling the robbery."
110214.0,Inquietude,1993.0,"The fact is, I 
don't think most people would enjoy this movie even if it did succeed 
on its own terms, just as most people are probably put off by THE 
SACRIFICE and similar works.; I am sure he is a fascinating human 
being.; I am sure, with all those years of life lived, he has some 
fascinating things to say about mortality.; He is 
89 years old and still at work.; Characters mostly sit in one place and talk, using very formal, 
'written' language.","This is by no means the worst film I have seen; at the very least, it 
has some potentially compelling ideas, which is more than you can say 
for some movies.; The man's repeated invocation of the phrase ""poor 
Suzy"" becomes unintentional self-parody.; The screenplay might actually make for good reading, 
but it just doesn't translate onto the screen.; De 
Oliveira's approach to his material seems to be one of philosophic 
detachment, but he was entirely too successful with the detachment 
part.; The sets are bland and unappealing, the lighting 
dim."
110520.0,Dirty Work,2000.0,"It's absolutely amazing.; Bob Saget's DIRTY WORK is no masterpiece of filmmaking, but it kept me
laughing at a rate more constant than anything I've seen lately.; And I loved watching it.; It's also amazingly funny, filled to the brim with jokes that
actually work and scenes that are unusually hilarious.; One of
the funniest scenes in the film has Mitch using a live commercial to
advertise his business; this segment involves a lot of dead prostitutes
in the trunks of new cars.","DIRTY WORK is offensive in the worst possible way: it's stupid AND
incompetent.; Unoriginal, unfunny, rude, offensive (especially to fat people and the
homeless), 'Dirty Work' doesn't even look like it has someone else
watching besides director Saget, interested enough to try and make the
film work.; This movie is a
desert, seconded only by SOUR GRAPES so far as the worst movie of the year.; The jokes are juvenile, crude, appealing to the worst elements in
people.; Alas, what could have been a
quirky dark comedy quickly collapses back into the dull, stale routine."
111794.0,20 Dates,1998.0,"Nevertheless, 20 DATES is pure, unadulterated fun, and a perfect date
movie.; It is very well edited.; But it is also a VERY FUNNY MOVIE!!!; Colm Meaney and Maury Chaykin are both terrific in supporting
roles, and one Mystery team player caught my eye: the big, likable oaf
Tree (a perfectly cast Kevin Durand).; At
any rate, the whole episode is worthwhile, because in
February of 1999 he will get to release an entertaining film
that moves ahead at a rapid pace and which includes clips
from popular movies like ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" ""When Harry
Met Sally,"" ""Singing in the Rain,"" and ""Titanic.""","""Everybody finds the French annoying""... Feminist Ballerina who (supposedly?); An interesting
concept with a bad result, 20 Dates gets * 1/2 stars.; His first
problem is funding, on what are supposedly secretly taped conversations Myles
and Elie Samaha, who's forking over the $60,000 to make the picture will only
do it if he can hire actresses to go out with him.; Rated R. 88 minutes.; None of the dates Myles
takes out are all that interesting and as for Myles himself, he's so god dang
self-involved that I hated him at about the 10 minute point."
111815.0,Mr. & Mrs. Bridge,2000.0,"Woodward's
performance is a little easier to appreciate, her character is more
lovable and emotional; she does wonderful things communicating strength
and fragility, confusion and wisdom.; The
supporting performances were uniformly excellent.; We move from the rigid, glacial walls
the characters present us to see them as real people with their own
pains and tragedies.; I can also mention with pleasure the performance
of Blythe Danner, Mrs. Bridge's best and unhappy friend.; Like all of Merchant-Ivory's period pieces, the look of this movie

watching her calm determination in the face of parents who announce their
concerns in board meetings that exposure to homosexuality will be a
dangerous influence on impressionable teenagers.; That kids are still driven to suicide in
this day and age because of their distress over sexual orientation is both
astounding and frightening.; They are astounding; the bravery shown by Gerber and Rustin, the
open love of the ""Boston marriage""; the nonviolent persistence of Barbara
Gittings from the 1960s through today.; That, and that alone, is the fierce conviction behind OUT OF THE

113209.0,TekWar: TekLords,1993.0,Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.,"Story of TEKWAR: TEKLORDS is burdened with
predictable situations, cheap melodrama and especially
disappointing deus ex machina ending.; TEKWAR: TEKLORDS represents huge disappointment for every
viewer who had expected the same quality as its predecessor
TEKWAR, rather decent little TV movie directed by Shatner
himself.; As the virus begins to
work its way through global computer networks, Cardigan must
also deal with some more personal issues concerning his son
and former wife, as well as with former Tek lord Sonny
Hokori (played by Van Flores) who might have something to do
with the new phenomena.; Even the acting is bad
compared with the first film, and TEKWAR: TEKLORDS might
give arguments to all those who had dismissed the whole
series based on the already unenviable reputation of
Shatner's books.; The second film was directed by seasoned Canadian
TV director George Bloomfield who managed to keep most of
TEKWAR's cyberpunk atmosphere thanks to CGI effects yet
failed to remedy huge defficiencies of Morgan Grendel's
script."
113219.0,TekWar,1998.0,"With more creative control and
CGI technology at his disposal, Shatner created quite
believable high-tech world of the near future that looks
more ""cyberpunk"" than other better known examples of that
still-born movie genre.; Cardigan would soon have to face powerful forces behind Tek
trade, as well as the world that changed beyond recognition.; All in all, TEKWAR looks
like rather good TV pilot, which can arouse interests for
future sequels, even among those who don't particularly like
Shatner, science fiction or cyberpunk.; Nevertheless, a decade later, those
movies inspired brief series of TV films, starting with
TEKWAR, directed by Shatner himself in 1994.; Filmske recenzije na hrvatskom/Movie Reviews in Croatian

positive side - same creative processes can use bad
literature as inspiration for good cinema.; For many
of the critics, those novels were nothing more than the lame
excuse for the famous actor to satisfy his vanity or cash in
his STAR TREK charisma.; Since Shatner not only wrote original novel, but also
directed this film, the expectations, based on his previous
directorial effort work in STAR TREK V, weren't great, to
say the least.; Their first task is to locate missing scientist
whose research might have brought cure to Tek plague.; Protagonist of the film is Jake Cardigan
(played by Craig Evigan), ex-policeman who awakens after
four years of cryogenic sleep - punishment for the crime he
didn't commit."
113279.0,Regret to Inform,1999.0,"If you know nothing about the war (many of the kids in our schools today
know little), then this documentary would leave you with two strong
impressions.; Sonneborn
turns a gut-wrenchingly complex situation into a simplistically easy
one.; Organized into a series of
interviews with the widows, the film intersperses archival footage of
the war and pastoral scenes of Vietnam today.; Global conflicts, such as the two World Wars, are full of glory than
lingers forever.; Handsomely filmed by Emiko Omori, Daniel Reeves and Nancy Schiesari, the
images make the tragic story palpable.","The significant downside to REGRET TO INFORM is that it is essentially a
propaganda piece since its views are completely one-sided.; Documentarians can produce good movies even if they are slanted.; It is not rated but would be PG-13 for
some war footage and would be fine for kids around 12 and up.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

114284.0,Praying with Anger,1996.0,"At times, the
people in PRAYING WITH ANGER seem real, but there are occasions when
they become foils for the plot.; The film is at its best when it explores Indian culture and
tradition, and examines how Dev must adjust to live in what for him is
a strange world.; There's the requisite tragic love story, the girl
who bucks the centuries-old system, the outsider who comes to be
respected by those who previously despised him, and, of course, the
coming of age tale.; Dev is reluctant
to go, but his mother, to whom he is devoted, insists.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","PRAYING WITH ANGER lacks originality and
inspiration, and after the initial interest has worn off, the story has
a hard time holding the viewer's attention.; However, beyond those brief-but-sterling moments, PRAYING WITH ANGER
relies on too much stock material for it to be satisfying enough to
warrant more than a passing interest.; Most of the
time, the lines are okay, but there are moments when he launches into
jarring, overblown sermon-like lectures.; Unfortunately, the basic plot is a series of formulas neatly
bundled together.; Like the dialogue, the characters are uneven."

description of an ideal twist that perfects everything

well past the point where it is welcome.; Watching one of these movies,

funny.; Both involved evil, universally hated old

(played by the stallion Justin, with a voice supplied by Alan Cumming),
the film follows the horse's adventures as he serves masters both kind
and cruel.; In many ways, BLACK BEAUTY is almost more of an adult movie than
one for children.; In addition to John
Sayles' as-yet-unreleased THE SECRET OF ROAN INNISH, both of these
films represent a rarity in pictures oriented towards the younger
crowd:  intelligent stories that can captivate parents.; Even THE LION KING, with its
Shakespearean leanings, is ultimately lighter than BLACK BEAUTY.; Hopefully, BLACK BEAUTY will get the attention it deserves.","Adults may avoid this movie because it's G-rated, based
on a children's book, and has actors speaking with British accents.; The real
stars of this film are the horses, and the humans, no matter how
heartfelt their performances, are barely noticed.; Children, on the other hand, may stay away because there are no musical

to notice how much lacquer they put in his hair to keep that one strand
dangling precariously over his brow.; (She's a rich girl from Park Avenue, Tom and Bill are best buddies from

obnoxious as the starched braids of Pippy Longstocking ... and a gradual
wave of titters start developing in the audience with each appearance.; Premiere Jan 23 at Sundance Film Festival, UT This film was so bad, it may end up being my ""guilty treat"" for

subject of little known inter-sectarian violence in American
Southwest is mostly ignored (MESSENGER OF DEATH, 1988 film
with Charles Bronson, was much better in exploring such
themes).; The sect seems unstoppable, until the dedicated
district attorney Daniel ""Dan"" Fields (Willliam Devane)
begins investigation and personal crusade with the intention
to bring Le Baron and cronies to justice.; In doing so, any means are
necessary, including violence and physical elimination of
rivals.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","What we get is the lame, predictable and sometimes
downright boring story, with Brian Dennehy, usually very
capable actor, making his character a third-grade
caricature.; Directed
by Judson Taylor, director who made more than fifty
television movies in his career, it shows the lack of any
interest by filmmakers.; The result of such philosophy is gazillion of docudramas,
movies whose only value is the fact that save time and
resources for those viewers hungry for true-life stories,
yet unable, or unwilling to spend their precious time and
resources for reading books or articles.; Same is with William Devane, as his adversary,
with boring subplots that fail to make his character human.; PROPHET OF EVIL falls within the second category."
116808.0,Othello,1996.0,"It is full of warm and realistic candlelit rooms.; It is full of warm and realistic candlelit rooms.; OTHELLO has never been one of my favorite of the 
Bard's plays, but, at times, I found myself engrossed by this 
adaptation.; Othello's ""tragic flaw"" is his jealousy, and it's this quality that 
Iago exploits with his complex scheme.; This story of the beautiful Desdemona (Irene Jacob), the
daughter of a Venetian nobleman, who elopes with her lover, Othello the
Moor, (Laurence Fishburne), a renowned warrior, like most of
Shakespeare's plays ends in betrayal, deceit and tragedy.","Iago's motivation (in the film) is never
clear at all, Branagh's acting here is pathetic, the very French actress
Jacob is woefully miscast as an Italian speaking in English, and while the
last 20 minutes of the film are pretty good, they don't make up for the
first 100, which are just dreadfully boring.; Sad to say, that
OTHELLO proves that, with the poor direction, even Shakespeare can be
made boring.; Sad to say, that

indie queen Parker Posey do great here, along with others I didn't 
recognize.; You know who you are and you know you're good.; The lack of action, 
movement and anything else catering to short attention spans will 
most likely drive most viewers to drink, but the intense acting, from 
people you've actually heard of, no less, keeps DRUNKS interesting.; Each actor
works in isolation, which makes it impossible to forget for a moment
that you're watching actors performing rather than flesh-and-blood
characters.","Plot - non-existent

people (only Spalding Gray seems to know how to make an isolated
monologue ring true) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; There's nothing here but the
barest of frameworks for a bunch of (admittedly talented) actors to
give their individual interpretations of alcoholism.; Otherwise, where's your plot?; Each story is
told as a monologue, with no connection to the rest of the film, and no
relationships developed between characters (wait, that's an exaggeration
- two of them did talk for a minute in the women's room).; The unknowns were even more convincing than the 
established actors, and I'd pay them their dues if I didn't have to go 
back through the movie, write their character names down and wait 
for the credits."

after suffering a uniquely tragic event - husband and father Hubert
(Pete Postlethwaite, ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"") returned from the pub
the night before and turned into a rat!; The film has some truly
side-splitting moments, particularly with the mysteries of the Catholic
faith, a strength reliably found in Irish filmmaking and the occasional Woody 
Allen movie.; Rather than exploring why Hubert became a rat we instead return to 
familiar territory about the corrupting influence of fame and the media.","Barron doesn't succeed, however, in drawing the theme of Wesley Burrowes'
script (particularly the obvious connection to Kafka's ""Metamorphosis"") into

choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman

characters are nicely contrasted.; Cleopatra is startling in its originality, and while it's only 93
minutes long, the movie feels epic in its scope, thanks to all the
twists and turns.","Robert's conundrum then is choosing between his safe, 
good-looking and boring wife and his no better looking but much sexier 
and exciting houseguest.; ""Cleopatra's Second Husband"" would make an OK diversion for late night cable,
but as a theatrical feature it's appeal will be extremely limitted.; This is strange and offputting, but leads absolutely nowhere, nor does
it provide any character illumination.; The
film completely loses its stream in its final act which is unsatisfying
and unappealing.; While the script contains some good (albeit unoriginal) ideas, the story
is so oddly executed that it frequently seems weird for weirdness' sake."
123358.0,Blondie,1997.0,"Part of what makes this film series so endearing is the perfect
casting.; This first film in the series is one of the best.; The
Dithers character works because those moments exist but are rare.; Dagwood loses his
job (for the first of a great many times) just when money is tight;
he must close a deal with an elusive client on his own to get it back.; The first entry in one of the longest running film series in
all of movie history (in terms of number of entries) introduces us
to the screen incarnations of the famous characters of what may be
the longest running comic strip in all of comic strip history.","And more trouble.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

123397.0,Weapons of the Spirit,1997.0,"I find tears on my face when thinking back on this
scene, about this man's modesty and his assurance that the rest of the world
has the quiet strength and courage of will that he himself possesses.; See it.; Pierre Sauvage lives in this world, and this country, and this era also.; What a wonderful world we
would have if people such as these were truly ""ordinary!""; Cynicism is easily promoted in almost every moral
and ethical area involved in our lives: scandals in religion, conflicts of
interests in politics, general apathy in dealing with what once were national
ideals.","""If it was was organized, it would never have worked!""; ""Organized?!""; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

124096.0,"Olivier, Olivier",1995.0,"Overall, however, this is a powerful and effective film that works
equally well as a drama and a mystery.; And it is well worth
your viewing time to get there.; Of special
interest is the love/hate relationship between Olivier and his sister,
and the way that Nadine's often-extreme jealousy works into the mix.; Brigitte Rouan's Elizabeth is in some ways reminiscent of Susan
Sarandon's character in LORENZO'S OIL.; The dynamics of the family, both before and after Olivier's
disappearance, are fascinating--as well as genuine.","Police and

124468.0,Ermo,1999.0,"And, although the message of ERMO is presented 
seriously, Zhou isn't above having a little fun, and his lighter touch 
is one of the most refreshing elements of this enjoyable little drama.; Ermo is not an exceptionally well-written 
character, but Alia does an excellent job of breathing life into her.; In many ways, this is 
refreshing, as the simpler story gives the viewer a different view of 
Chinese culture.; In many ways, the final moments of the film
answer that question very well.; The overall theme of ERMO echoes a simple truism:  it's often 
better wanting than having.","Afterwards, how much of that will be replaced by apathy?; Another evil
enters the picture as well: Blindman, who constantly complains of his
""fat, slack-assed wife"" is paying Ermo a lot of mind, and making the
career suggestions that keep her from her home Ermo is a tedious cross between Madame Bovary and Sunrise.; She
even starts selling blood for money, at an alarming rate.; That Ermo sinks to demeaning depths all for the sake of buying a
29-inch TV set really hits you over the head.; And instead of selling noodles, she ends up getting
another job and also giving away blood for various causes."
124487.0,Rhythm Thief,1999.0,"This begins a cat-and-mouse game that leads Simon into 
progressively more dangerous territory, even as he tries to sort out his 
confused sex life and keep his cat well-fed.; Despite the attempts of Fuller, a local 
hanger-on, to hook up with him, Simon manages to maintain a one man 
business.; When Simon is 
being beaten up, we see the attack from his point-of-view.; - James Berardinelli (jberardinell@delphi.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; It's really just a slice-of-life motion picture sheathed in a cinema 
verite style -- of passing interest, but not the sort of thing I would 
recommend going out of the way for, and certainly *not* if you don't 
have a predilection for art-house fare.","Shot in grainy, 16 
mm black-and-white, it's more notable for inventive cinematography and 
quirky dialogue than for solid plotting or characterization.; The story is trite and the characters aren't 
engaging, but Harrison's efforts can be appreciated on a technical 
level.; However, there's only so much to be gleaned from this sort of movie.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

Harrison, directing his second feature (his first, SPARE ME -- a 
""bowling thriller"" -- was seen only by friends and family), emphasizes 
technique over narrative."
124524.0,When the Bough Breaks,1999.0,"Ally Walker gives really strong
performance as psychological investigator troubled with her
own personal, and never revealed, demons.; WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS is relatively little known
1993 film, that tries, less than other examples, to hide
being inspired by Jonathan Demme's work.; That impression is, actually, more to
Michael Cohn's credit - he looked at Demme's work very hard,
and unlike many others, found out what had worked in SILENCE
OF THE LAMBS and what had not.; Fans of Ally
Walker would probably enjoy this film very much, since it
could be seen as sort of prelude to her cult TV series THE
PROFILER.; Spawned by the smashing success of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,
genre of the serial killer film proved to be one of the most
enduring trends in the last decade.","Movie begins with horrible discovery which indicates that
the Texan town became target area for vicious serial killer
who dismembers little children.; This film, written and directed by Michael Cohn, at first
glance, gives impression of being really cheap knock-off of
SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.; The main
character, obviously inspired by Clarice Starling, is
original, though.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
124604.0,Augustin,1990.0,"Those interested in this kind of quirky character dissection will
find AUGUSTIN refreshing, and the film's brevity is a definite plus.; But Anne Fontaine's film
is devoted to the minutiae of everyday living, as it gives us an
hour-long portrait of a dull, unimportant Frenchman.; When AUGUSTIN works, it's largely
because of the performance of lead actor Jean-Chretien Sibertin-Blanc,
who invests his character--a weasely neurotic--with a certain
likability.; In
many ways, that's what AUGUSTIN is, although its running time is a
whole lot shorter than what Jesse suggests.; It's an unusual, cinema
verite-style character study that takes place over a several-day period.","Strange material, indeed... AUGUSTIN doesn't have much of a plot.; More time with this person would have been tiresome.; Jesse proposes doing ""a day in the life of...""
program where one ordinary person's activities--no matter how
mundane--would be shown live and unedited for twenty-four hours.; The camera even
follows the main character into the bathroom, and stays there while he
sits on the toilet and explains why he chose this lavatory over others
in the building.; Since Augustin is thorough to the point of absurdity, he decides to
research the role--that of a room service attendant in a four star
hotel--by spending a day at one of Paris' finest, delivering meals to
distinguished guests and helping a maid make beds, clean mirrors, and
scrub wash basins."
124619.0,Lotto Land,1994.0,"Hank's father Milt (blues legend Wendell Holmes)
rediscovers long-extinguished passion with Joy's guardian Nini (Suzanne
Costallos).; Trust me, it's not
as complicated as it sounds...or as interesting.; The acting is workmanlike, and the plot is
predictable, but the movie's intentions--to tell a story of purity,
romance, redemption, and modern-day chivalry--are so noble you can't help
but smile and say, ""How cute...."" Cute--that's the sum of it.; Hank (Larry Gilliard, Jr.) and Joy (Barbara Gonzalez) are about to
embark on prom night.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Basically just a talky drama, LOTTO LAND has a heart of gold but is
as lifeless as overcooked spaghetti.; As a result, the movie just meanders in the
undeveloped storyline and finishes up with an appropriate yet totally
unfulfilling conclusion.; Oh, and Joy's drunken, roller-skating, drug-dealing father
just may have won $27 million in the New York Lottery.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; Ho hum, no jackpot this time."
124633.0,Someone Else's America,1999.0,"This bonding and the smaller stories that
are in the film make it one that you will savor, that you will not
soon forget..    Do not miss this unassuming little gem..; Paskaljevic's film reminds us that simple tales are often the most 
affecting.; This is a tragic comedy, with 
moments of wry, unforced humor peppering the drama.; In this beautifully told story of two immigrants and their
families in America,  we feel the difficulties they encounter, the
homesickness, the troubles they must endure.; When asked why he crossed the ocean, Bayo responds that, 
though he would love to go back home, he has to remind himself daily 
that he came here to build a future for his two youngest children.","It is rated R, but there is no
nudity, no violence, little bad language, and only the start of sex.; Other than having the characters talk about their holy grail -
getting a green card - the script finds little to say.; The low point
of the film is a unbelievable sequence where Alonso tricks his blind
and ill mother (Maria Casares) into believing they are flying all the
way back to Spain by playing a tape of a jet on a boom box while they
set in a seat taken out of a car.; The script by Gordan Mihic and the pace set by director Goran
Paskaljevic meanders.; The acting is earnest, but monochromatic, and I did not
find any of the characters believable."
124834.0,Mondo,1997.0,"I would give ""Mondo"" a rating of G while stressing that
adults will find this wonderful, warm realistic-poetic work totally
engrossing.; There'something both subtle
and obvious as Mondo is placed in an environment of enticing French foods,
supermarkets, fresh fruit and  vegetables--yet at times has to get his
sustenance from nature.; Mondo is curious, friendly, lovable.; The cast
includes a Turkish Kurd woman, a political refugee, who sings
beautifullyand adds to the splendid variety of music here;  a postman who
is areal postman; and other ""real people.""; There is the magician (Philippe Petit)
and his friend (Schaia Aalam) who, too, look after him a
bit.","The last  words of the film's are
voice-off: ""We looked for Mondo everywhere.; Is it an accident that a welfare officer says that Mondo is ""a wild child,""
the title of a Truffaut movie?; Not rated.; ""Gypsies are undesirables, thieving and
smelly.""; Mondo is played by Ovidiu Balan, a
Rumanian gypsy about whom I know nothing (I am writing this review without
benefit of press information) except that after the movie was made he and
his family were deported back to Rumania."
124857.0,Trojan Eddie,1979.0,"It is worth seeing for the tremendous performances and a bit
of the gritty local flavor not usually seen about a film emanating from
Ireland.; The cast is top-notch, led by Harris's bone-chilling arrogant hoodlum
portrayal, who can't stop bullying people.; He is  emotionally wrought at
not being able to straighten his life out, and not till the very end of
the film do we see him get some satisfaction from dealing with his
bullying boss.; He is intimidating to
everyone around him.; A
very scornful look at what some will do to get what they want or think
they want.","The main
problem it has, is that  the story gets bogged down on unnecessary
subplots, which make it difficult to focus entirely on the main story.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; His ex-wife Shirley (Ball) is a tramp.; He tempts this itinerant girl with his possessions and asks
her hand in marriage.; He is mean-spirited and ornery."
125025.0,East Side Story,1998.0,"(Germany, 1997, in German, Russian, Czeck and Rumanian with English Subtitles) Seen on 29 June 1997 for $8 with Tony at the Film Forum.; Audiences loved these movies for the simple
pleasures of song, dance, and comedy.; Nevertheless, you'll find it hard to believe much of what you see
(and hear, if you know German, Russian, or Czech).; One, Grigori Alexandrov's Volga Volga, was his favorite--he
   viewed it more than 100 times and made a gift of it to FDR during the
   war.; If it's playing in your area, you won't do any better for goofy,
surreal fun than ""East Side Story,"" a documentary about musical films made
in Eastern Europe between 1934 and 1973.","The musicals themselves are as good, bad, memorable, forgettable,
   clever or stupid as anything made here.; Looking at that rollicking farce about singing boatmen, you'd
never guess that it was made during the worst period of Stalin's genocidal
campaign to remove potential enemies.; Instead, it uses
musicals to point up the socialists' failure to see how providing
consumers with entertainment (like the damned capitalist countries did)
could have served their own best interests.; I arrived late, but
  missed about two minutes of the film.; But everyone loves the movies and wants
   to be entertained, especially if you have been waiting all day on line
   for state-sponsored toilet paper at GUM."
125079.0,Licensed to Kill,1995.0,"Teenagers need to be mature to be able to handle the
intensity of the images.; The scene in LICENSED TO KILL from nearby San Jose really brought
the film home for me.; I recommend the documentary to you and give
it ** 1/2.; The film could be considered their
brief autobiographies as Dong uses still photos of the murderers
growing up to make them seem more like flesh-and-blood people than
monsters locked behind bars.; LICENSED TO KILL, not to be confused with the James Bond film
called LICENCE TO KILL, is a harrowing tale of violence against gays.","LICENSED TO KILL runs just 1:20.; Documentaries
need energy, or they can become as dry as reading a dictionary.; Most of the convicts show some remorse,
but none are particularly convincing.; This casual
style represents the film's single biggest downfall.; It is not rated but would be R
for its troubling and explicit pictures of people who have been beaten,
stabbed, or shot."
125093.0,Too Much Sleep,1997.0,"But often the scenarios that play out within
Maquiling's excellent frame are scattershot and self-consciously told.; Marc Palmieri is deadpan
in his delivery of his slacker  Jack persona and it works out for a short
while.; In the film's funniest scene, Eddie manages to
bring Jack right to the older woman half of the team who scammed him.; A final
scene on Eddie's front lawn allows for one more bout of comedic philosophizing
from Gaeta.; Naturally, we expect Jack
will also find himself along the way.","Some
improvisation might have helped the film considerably rather than having
the actors constantly forced to reel off the director's stilted conversations.; Robert Mowen's camera has little to work with in a film that
could easily fit on your 13-inch TV screen.; Who wants to spend
15 minutes with a blabber like Eddie or listen to the jabbering
of a woman who runs into Jack at the bus terminal and
lectures him about how much he looks like his father--while
not recognizing that Jack's looking all around the room
signifies his lack of interest?; Let's take the weight from Mr. Maquiling's shoulders and
presume that he's simply writing a shaggy-dog story about
his own youth in a bland American suburban neighborhood.; Overall,
""Too Much Sleep"" tries too hard to be whimsical."
125099.0,Unmade Beds,1994.0,"The film score is also very effective.; It is a film that highlights the problems
that can be found in urban areas across America, as we bear witness to
the plight of these singles trying to search for a mate through the
internet and the personals, faced with agonizing loneliness and
unresolved psychological problems.; The unstated, and therefore more powerful, message of this movie is
that the cash nexus distorts everything.; Everything is
riding on your initial appearance.; The film imitates those famous apartment windows Jimmy
Stewart looked into for that 1950s look at New York City.","What
Barker did was to send a research team into the singles field,
each disguised as a guy or gal on the prowl.; The only problem is
that he doesn't seem to realize that he, like the furnishings, has a
dated and seedy quality.; Since she was an
extremely good-looking young woman, I couldn't exactly figure out why
she had placed an ad.; She has apparently not heard of the concept that
you can lose weight if you burn more calories than you
consume and seems to blame the gods for making her fat.; I
had to put up with this nonsense when I worked on Wall Street."
125123.0,Among Giants,1994.0,"This is essentially Postlethwaite's film, and he gives a
quietly moving performance as the man who is vulnerable to love, but
Griffiths more than holds her own as the woman who just doesn't want
to commit to anything.; It's a job of high risks, uncertain payments and plenty of
challenges.; If you accept the story
as caprice--as though Postlethwaite were having a
midsummer night's wet dream--you could go with the
generally bleak and gritty but sometimes touching story of a
crew of working stiffs painting electricity pylons in England's
Derbyshire Peak District.; Beaufoy's script is also at its best as it explores the
humour, mateship and sense of identity that unites the working class
in this bleak post-Thatcher Britain.; Simon Beaufoy, writer of The Full Monty, knows the depressing
working class areas of northern England quite well, and he returns to
this familiar background for the setting of his latest film.","But could a 24-year-old get turned on by the 53-year-old Pete
Postlethwaite?; Director Sam Miller hails from a television background, and he handles
his first feature film in a fairly straight forward and uninspired
fashion.; But, otherwise, this unspectacular and often pedestrian
romantic drama seems little more than a high class, big budget
television movie.; Copyright 1998 Nathaniel R. Atcheson Visually interesting but emotionally vacuous, Sam Miller's Among Giants
stars Pete Postlethwaite as a painter who falls in love with a tomboy
(Rachel Griffiths).; Postlethwaite in particular seems uncomfortable in the role
of a romantic lead."
125418.0,Stigmata,1998.0,"Byrne is also very good, and he gives a much more
intelligent and restrained performance here than in End Of Days.; Jeffrey Kimball's
cinematography is also beautifully moody and adds to the edgy quality
of this effective and surprisingly entertaining horror thriller.; http://members.aol.com/DeWyNGaLe/MoviePED.html Rupert Wainwright brings us Stigmata, a high powered, clever thrill ride that
stands as one of the most intriguing and spellbinding films I've ever seen.; The rapid, stylish, somewhat hyperactive way
Stigmata was filmed, along with its booming, spontaneous soundtrack, not
only makes the film more palatable but it also diverts our attention
somewhat from the movie's inconsistencies and makes it easier to watch.; I commend Wainwright mainly for his
portrayal of how the stigmata are imprinted on Frankie, using graphically
realistic flash images of nails being driven into her hands, feet, and well,
you get the picture.","Stigmata is not a bad movie, in the sense of having bad acting or
production values or a lifeless, boring script.; The last thirty minutes of the movie are a
waste and really waste the movie.; It only lacks one thing: scares.; The movie is far from being bad it's just that it is a big let-down.; A minute¹s worth of sex in greater cinema like
³Eyes Wide Shut² is too obscene for mass audiences, but 100
minutes of bloodshed here isn¹t?"
125582.0,Down in the Delta,1994.0,"Pure and simple, this is a rich story about the power of family, with a 
terrific ensemble cast.; Al
Freeman is particularly effective as the strong uncle who
steers Loretta in the right direction with Mary Alice turning in
a robust role as the sturdy grandmother who realizes her
impotence in the face of the unhealthy attractions of a large
urban center.; Freeman alone makes this film worth watching, guiding both
viewers and other characters to an understanding of what can be 
accomplished through a sense of shared responsibility.; It is rare to see a film extol the values of devotion, hard 
work and dedication without becoming leaden or preachy.; Mary Alice is forceful as stubborn matriarch Rosa 
Lynn, young Mpho Koaho gives a remarkably assured performance as Thomas, 
a child mature beyond his years, and the late Esther Rolle, in her final 
film appearance, is heart-breaking as a once-vibrant woman turned into a 
jittery child by Alzheimer's.","Young men hang around cars looking surly, while second
unit footage passes buildings that might as well have ""The Projects""
stamped across them.; Usually films of this kind struggle
by becoming too strident; this one struggles by being not nearly strident
enough.; The last few scenes are anti-climatic and unnecessary.; Too many scenes end with slow fades to white 
or black, and flashback sequences of a nightmarish family trauma during 
the Civil War are amateurishly staged and replayed excessively.; Director Maya Angelou almost seems afraid of
getting her hands dirty, as though the story's more uplifting message will
be sullied by showing inner city life at its worst."
125587.0,Nothing Personal,1995.0,"A very tense film packed with powerful emotions.; Even if their characters aren't all that well-developed, several of 
the leads give memorable performances -- notably Ian Hart (HOLLOW REED), 
whose Ginger is a portrait of uncurbed aggression; James Frain, who 
injects an aspect of humanity into Kenny; and the ever-effective Michael 
Gambon.; The atmosphere, thick 
with claustrophobia, paranoia, and a pervasive sense of impending doom, 
is potent in a way that the protagonists aren't.; In Ireland, it's referred to as ""the troubles.""; Only the location is different -- this is Belfast, not 
Guildford.","Unfortunately, in his pursuit of even-handedness, O'Sullivan fails 
to create more than a few worthwhile characters.; Too bad there couldn't be more.; If balance was the only criteria 
for a good film about Ireland, NOTHING PERSONAL would get top marks.; Explorations of violence -- its causes, its meaning, and its 
effects -- are difficult to present on film because they're so easy to 
get wrong.; And what a terrible
euphemism it has been and continues to be."
125707.0,Innocence,2000.0,"I don't think I'd go as far as my online colleague in
Australia, Andrew Howe, who in reviewing the movie on
December 13, 2000 called it ""without reservation...a wonderful
film...leavened with warmth, compassion..."" even quipping that
this film will change your life.; The way Paul Cox stimulates our thinking about this and other
matters is part of what makes this a resourceful film, one which
racked up prizes at film festivals all over the place--Taormina,
Toronto, Vlissengen, Montreal, Saint-Tropez among other
locations.; ""Innocence"" deals with the reaction that the people have to the 
relationship of these two, well, sexagenarians.; ""Innocence"" is inviting as well because, admit
it: you're wondering about your first love, and maybe
your second or third as well.; Tony Clark does a fine
job behind the lens capturing flashbacks to the salad days of
the principals, proving what Tim Burton (""Planet of the Apes"") 
knew all along.","What's that supposed
to mean?; Miserable and single?; Not Rated.; What's sex going
to be like then?; How do we know?"
125762.0,Shattered Image,1998.0,"Illusion vs. reality is one of the great themes of
storytellers and in ""The Shattered Image"" director Raul Ruiz
pushes the envelope by having his principal character, Jessie
(Anne Parillaud), confused to the point of insanity about
which of her two sides is the real Jessie.; As the two sides of the same woman collide with
each other, a harsh sound like a gunshot or the ring of a
telephone or the shattering of glass brings one Jessie up
sharply and turns her into the other.; It's quite an intriguing piece which might remind film
buffs of the late Kryzstof Kieslowski's even more cryptic ""The
Double Life of Veronique,"" in which two women, one Polish
and one French, subtly affect each other's lives while
remaining total strangers.; The audience, instead of being a step or two
ahead of the characters (as in the ""Oedipus"" legend) is kept
as much in the dark as the principal character, the enigma
finally revealed in the concluding moments to Jessie and to
the movie audience simultaneously.; The
prolific and gifted regisseur turned out ""Genealogies of a
Crime"" last year with a similar strain, highlighting Catherine
Deneuve in a dual role as the lawyer for and victim of a
strange young man who's accused of murdering his
psychiatrist aunt after she allegedly subjected him to radical
mind-control treatments.","And boring.; Parillaud and Baldwin, who aren't exactly Shakespearean material to begin
with, are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero
chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines.; These two lives, with Parillaud looking like Siouxsie Sioux with a
black wig, black emotionless eyes, and black leather clothing in the
Seattle-based assassin scenes, and moping around like Karen Carpenter in
the Jamaica scenes, play out endlessly throughout the film and the result
is it's now *twice* as boring as it might have been.; Every now and again it's fun to watch a really bad movie.; Lines like: ""You're not the reason I couldn't care less about you."""
126139.0,Topless Women Talk About Their Lives,1997.0,"Not just the events, but
also the tone of some of the end is wrong, clashing strongly with the
sense of fun that has preceded it.; As stated above, the first hour is superb and even the end
is above average.; At times, the events border on the ridiculous, like the
screening of the film, but they still seem in keeping with the
characters and their lives.; A lot of the performances
are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the
documentary feel of the film.; While the final half hour is not beyond the
realms of possibility, it's unlikely in a way that is jarring to
someone caught up in the world of the film.","Such a
disappointment after such a brilliant start.; This is not to say that Topless Women Talk About Their Lives is not a
good film.; It just takes a turn which means that an otherwise
brilliant movie loses some of its gloss.; Topless Women Talk About Their Lives falls into that category that I
mentioned in The Devil's Advocate: movies that have a brilliant
beginning but don't know how to end.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
126211.0,Comedian Harmonists,1999.0,"The performances from the superb ensemble cast are all
perfectly pitched at the right level.; A superbly crafted and lavishly
produced film, Comedian Harmonists is an enjoyable, and ultimately
moving cinematic experience.; THE
HARMONISTS, unlike the wildly popular Oscar winner LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,
is a true story that just happens to occur during an untimely era.; It is very good.; It has lightness, humor,
effervescence.The singers are excellent.","She must look like a student trying to make extra money.""; I confess that I was baffled.I don't know what the upsetting reference is
here, nor how historically true this Streicher ""invitation"" was.; Someone eventually has the bright notion of baptizing it, in English
--except for the article-- Die Comedian Harmonists.; As far as the Nazis, their hatred is very apparent and very gripping
across all levels of society during this time.This film takes, in my
opinion, an erroneous view of their activity, soft peddling it, and
stating that it was only among the lower classes that anti-Semitism was
prevalent, that the upper classes and the cultured classes were
generally supportive of the Jews.This is just not true.; The wedding has klezmer music, enormous brio, and none of
the satire that one finds in many such ceremonies in American movies, by
Jewish filmmakers too."
128771.0,Golden Braid,1997.0,"But Bernard finds inside
one of the secret drawers a golden braid and this sets his imagination
off; he tries to have conversations with the braid in order to find out
about the love life of the woman whose braid it is, believing that it's
still alive and can understand him.; The story revolves around his newest romantic obsession, another
sensitive but lost soul like him, Terese (Gosia Dobrowolska).; It's a film for those who appreciate oddities in filmmaking and are not
deterred by the slightness of the story or the slow way it gets to where
it's going.; There's a quiet brilliance about this melancholy chamber piece, that is
much enhanced by the artistic cinematography of Nino Gaetano Martinetti.; She tells him that she only
knows that she's alive when she's with someone who loves her, and
demands his full attention.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

129842.0,Another Woman,1993.0,"Betty Buckley instills a refreshing breath of life into the film
during her one minute cameo appearance.; Rowlands covers the vent up at first but can't resist the 
beautiful opportunity for aural voyeurism, and listens in on Mia 
Farrow's session everyday.; It is the most 
obscure Woody movie out there right now, more so than even 
WHAT'S UP, TIGER LILY?; The movie has a fine (and sizeable) supporting cast--including Martha
Plimpton, David Ogden Stiers, and the late John Houseman in his final
role.; You 
won't laugh during ANOTHER WOMAN, but you will think, you will 
feel and, at least once, you will probably identify.","This is the only success of the three, an 
unpleasant, uncompromising movie that exposes a seemingly 
successful woman's life as a complete sham.; The female Woody doppelganger this time is played by Gena 
Rowlands, a no-nonsense woman who just turned 50 and seems to 
have everything in life.; Rowlands gives a solid performance and is convincing as a woman
incapable of expressing either warmth or passion, but, unfortunately, her

creativity and is sometimes hard to swallow, its dialogue is for the most

only disappointing performance is from Channing, whose Sister Husband is

these minor downfalls don't detract away from my overall feelings on 
""Mascara,"" which is that it is a rare mature film about free-thinking adults, 
and one that treats its characters with an open mind and a big heart.; Laura may seem the most grounded at first, but then we discover that her job 
as a psychotherapist is overshadowed by a scene when we find she has a 
therapist of her own.; Laura is apprehensive 
and nervous, as many brides-to-be understandably are, but seven months later, 
we discover that Donnie has begun to cheat on her, and being the resolute 
woman that she is, Laura packs up and leaves him, moving back in with her 
possessive parents.; In one of the best 
scenes in the film, Rebecca pays a visit to her dad, who works as an auto 
mechanic.; Amanda de Cadenet decidedly has the most difficult role, and goes through the 
most changes, but is up to the challenge, believably displaying a wide range 
of emotions as a woman who doesn't feel wanted by anyway, most of all her 
husband, despite his constant apologizing for what he once did.","One late 
sequence, however, in which Jennifer goes home with the wrong man, who then 
violently rapes her, felt out-of-place and nothing comes of the scene 
afterwards.; Its purpose, of course, was to be an incident that finally knocks 
some sense into her concerning her impending path of destruction, but the 
scene still could have been more well-handled.; Movies 
about a group of young women and their exploits concerning love, career, and 
identity are a dime a dozen, and even if ""Mascara"" isn't one of the very best 
of the genre, it is also far from one of the worst, due to the apt way in 
which the characters are dealt with and developed.; As far as her husband Donnie goes, she still loves him,

tarnishes, its worlds-of-old predecessors.; At 28-years-old, Winona Ryder (1999's ""Girl, Interrupted"") is still the same 
captivating presence that she has always been, and the ability she has to 
capture the screen every time she appears is quite remarkable.; Not a
film that will win over the MTV generation, but definitely a decent creepy
thriller that'll keep you on your toes while cuddled under a blanket, late
at night, all by yourself.; Its final 
scene is challenging and fairly equivocal, casting a whole new light on 
everything that had come before.","It's quite another for it to
be an outright bore.; In defense of STIGMATA, it was at

to much, joining the rest of the recent ill-fated attempts at a 
religious-themed thriller.; If Pierce Gardner and Betsy Stahl's story is hopelessly
segmented, at least we're treated to a few (but far between)

through 106 mintues of depressingly granulated film, couldn't
Kaminski simply deliver about ten minutes of the stuff and

consideration and then go to wide release early in the new year.","To put it directly, this movie is a combination of just about every
air disaster movie ever made but to make matters worse, the psychotic nature
of Liotta's character has him spinning off ridiculous and unoriginal dialogue
for cheap laughs and his character echoes that of one from almost any horror
movie you can imagine.; The movie has a dark and sadistic look from a grade B
horror film to boot and its production design, special effects and camera
work are on the amateur level at best.; It's an early year filler that studios
have to get out of their system after the Christmas and New year holiday
seasons have passed and this is one of the worst times of the year to see a
new movie and this will go down as one of 1997's most badly made films.; His last admirable
piece of cinema was 'Unlawful Entry' (1992) in which he played the
personification of evil as a corrupt police officer obsessed with another

imagine why; the entire film seems enormously plausible.; So as much of the film
as I could understand I rate a +1 on the -4 to +4 scale."
146599.0,Once Upon a Time... When We Were Colored,1992.0,"There's a wonderfully festive Sunday picnic characterized by food, 
games, and good times.; I recommend this excellent
show to you and award it ***.; This is immediately followed by a KKK march, one of the 
film's few grim, tense scenes.; The film is highlighted by a pair of strong performances.; Although ONCE UPON A TIME is occasionally disjointed, and some of the 
transitions are abrupt, it nevertheless offers a compelling chronicle of 
one man's growth into adulthood during volatile times, when courageous 
men and women began challenging an unjust system.","The main problem with ONCE UPON A TIME is that it makes frequent side
trips to episodic stories which don't resonate, despite insistent
voice-over narration (provided by screenwriter Paul W. Cooper) that tries
to convince us that they should.; If its story and its characters had been as
consistent as its good intentions, it might have been a great film.; There is no sex, no nudity, mild violence and only
a few bad words.; It is one of the more cumbersome pieces of baggage which goes along
with being a film critic that, every once in a while, a film comes along
which you are _supposed_ to like on general principle.; There is a sub-plot involving the return
of Ma Ponk's son Melvin (Leon) to visit from his new home in Detroit, and
his attempt to convince an old girlfriend to come with him."
148451.0,Committed,1998.0,"Backed by the furrowed brow malaise
of Luke Wilson (Home Fries, Dog Park and one of the best episodes of The
X Files) and the way-cooler-than-his-brother Casey Affleck (200
Cigarettes), Graham's wide-eyed charm is disarming and convincing.; There's something intriguing about the
way it is assumed someone who will fight to the end for a marriage must be
a bit nuts, just as it is assumed fervent believers in anything must be a
bit nuts.; She's not just into
marriage, but honesty in general, and the film's first postulate is that
that makes her unique.; Graham holds the spotlight for almost every second of Committed, as
Joline, a club manager who is embarking on her lifelong commitment to
love of her life Carl (Luke Wilson).; Once she's there, Joline shadows Carl not unlike a stalker, keeping
watch over him without making her presence known.","But in
_Committed_, she has somehow made this potentially provocative subject
boring.; Casey Affleck
as Joline's phlegmatic brother--a young man who unlike his
sister seems to have no boundaries or desires to commit to
anyone or anything--is meant to be an appealing, laid-back
personality, but comes across instead as a guy who at best
some 23-year-old women might want to mother.; Unfortunately, she appears to spend all her acting energy on the work of
yanking Joline from the jaws of caricature.; Or perhaps everything around Joline just seems more
interesting because Graham doesn't have the presence to command the
narrative's focus.; Aimed at a GenX audience, Committed would be
perfect for that audience except that it is slow and way too analytical,
in the way that Thai stick induced philosophy is ."
150093.0,Just Like a Woman,2000.0,"When she learns the truth, Monica's first reaction is hysterical
laughter, and the devastating effect this has on Gerald is borne out by
his expression.; JUST LIKE A WOMAN takes great pains to treat the subject of
transvestism with a modicum of sensitivity, while avoiding taking a
preachy stance.; Starring:  Adrian Pasdar, Julie Walters, Paul Freeman, 
           Susan Wooldridge, Ian Redford 
Director: Christopher Monger 
Producer:  Nick Evans 
Screenplay:  Nick Evans based on GERALDINE by Monica Jay 
Cinematography:  Alan Hume 
Music:  Michael Storey 
Released by the Samuel Goldwyn Company Most cross-dressing comedies are played for broad laughs.; Julie Walters is steady and reliable as the strictly female Monica (the
only time she gets to cross-dress is in a brief dream sequence).; And, although
she is jealous at first, she soon learns that the mysterious visitor
was none other than Geraldine, Gerald's feminine alter-ego.","On the
other hand, there are two sequences--one involving a hypnotist and
another occurring during a board meeting--where things get too silly,
crossing the line from funny to ridiculous.; It
isn't particularly engaging, and its ultimate purpose is to afford the
opportunity for a disappointing, ""crowd-pleasing"" ending.; If you ignore the
tedious conflict between Gerald and his boss Miles (Paul Freeman),
what's left is a droll view of a straight couple who appear, on certain
nights, to be lesbians.; The
result is a moderate diminution of the movie's more enjoyable aspects.; He just likes to dress up in women's clothing."
151227.0,Mother,1995.0,"Although MOTHER boasts a host of hilarious one-liners, the best 
moments are the extended episodes that delve into everyday life.; Mother is
one of the most realistic slices of life I've ever seen and I related to it
better than most movies I saw in 1996 and Debbie Reynolds is terrific as the
mother who offers love, advice and compassion in an unorthodox and least
obvious way towards her sons.; This probably 
isn't the funniest or most inventive comedy of the year, but it gets 
high marks in both categories.; A man who's rarely 
mentioned, however, is Albert Brooks, one of this country's most 
underrated comics.; Albert Brooks is a treat as always and this
gem of a movie is certain to become another buried treasure which will
probably find a huge following on home video as its theatre release has been
limited.","MOTHER doesn't have much of a plot.; The result is frustrating, as
though Brooks were telling jokes then stopping after each one to explain
why it was just as sad as it was funny.; From the parody of Simon and Garfunkel's 
""Mrs. Robinson"" to the scenes of Beatrice attempting to work a video-
phone, MOTHER represents more than just another carbon-copy, unfunny 
comedy.; The 
director/writer strives for quality over quantity, and when he wants the 
audience to laugh, they generally do so.; MOTHER is a perfect
example of Brooks' nose for high-concept, but for once he doesn't work any
particular magic with it."
154821.0,Arguing the World,1987.0,"Facilitating that will be the accomplished fact that
the Soviet Union no longer exists.; We want to know the reasoning the others had for their
different viewpoints.; We
want to know Kristol's reasoning that led to his agreement with
McCarthy.; For the first
time in their lives they could afford an automobile.; Not only has it remained more prosperous, it
has also elevated rugged individualism to the level of a religion.","Beyond their ideological differences, Hayden found Howe's
style patronizing and offensively avuncular.; Dorman recreates the period with archival footage showing New York
and California at the time of the events, but what is on the screen
frequently is just a scene without much obvious relevance to what is
being said.; While the four
substantially agreed, it would have been useful to be told the
substance of their beliefs, but it was not important to understanding
their history.; The strongest point made by the film is that most of these
leftist protesters quit the party and became anti-Communist
when they heard the remarkable news that their idol, Soviet
leader Josef Stalin, did not turn out to be a Slavic Mother
Teresa but was instead a paranoid, totalitarian despot who
put thousands of innocents on trial and somehow got them to
confess to preposterous charges of treason.; None makes the slightest
effort to prettify themselves."
155387.0,Fury,1996.0,"Lang makes Rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity
against the recklessness of his human counterparts.; Through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a
mob, Fritz Lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination
towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility.; As Joe faces his peril, trapped in his burning cell, his dog Rainbow rushes
to be by his side.; A year goes by and Joe buys a car and tells Katherine that he will meet
her to get married in Capitol City, that he has quit his job and hopes
to open a gas station.; Using his camera to
create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality, Lang depicts
man's volatility and `impulse' towards inconceivable cruelty.","Instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small
American towns where lynchings actually do occur, and they thereby
meddled throughout the entire script.; While a long, or dolly
shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob, panning from the mob's
belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the
claustrophobia of the scene; we feel we are at the epicenter of something
infinitely large.; But don't blame Lang
for all the changes in the film, of trying to take the town off the hook
by introducing this wild revenge motive.; But proof comes by way of a
newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film.; We see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing
that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then
carefully slips out of the bar."
155494.0,Killing Time,1997.0,"It had a
good soundtrack (an excellent song from Portishead worked great with the
preview).; When I saw the preview such a long time ago I was positively sure that

seem to be so great at.; She plays William Tell with one of
the hitmen.","The cinematography is as poor as the script.; British action filmmakers put out this piece of crap, thinking that they
would be like the Americans.; However, it
is just as contrived, just as boring, and just as idiotic as an action
picture.; Yet, when push came to shove, Killing Time seems like an extra
waste of my time.; A tip for Western European action wannabes:
American Action films are nothing to mimic."
155577.0,Lilith,1998.0,"become the playground in which Liz and
Dick play their ""hump the hostess"" and ""get the guests"" games.; After reading ""Warren Beatty and Desert Eyes,"" you wonder if
author-critic David Thomson can sleep well at night knowing that his
hyperbole on Robert Rossen's LILITH is so far off the mark as to become
self-tormenting: it's ""the best film Beatty has made at that point in
his career and you could make a case that it is the best he will ever
make.; After SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS, THE
ROMAN SPRING OF MRS. STONEand ALL FALL DOWN, they had already granted
that Beatty was well on his way to proving that he indeed saw Hollywood
as a great big bed.; As the
scheming Lilith, Jean Seberg is institutionalized because she's a
nymphomaniac, and, as a therapist-in-training trying to pull her from
her amoralism, Beatty falls in love with her.; A failure in its year (1964), the picture grows more profound and
beautiful as the years pass by.","But Thomson's
British-born and educated, which goes a long way in explaining his
witless annotation.; Seberg, on the other hand, isn't
much more than a tramp with extra-large looking front teeth that have a
repellency when viewed close up.; Watching LILITH, based on the 1961 J.R. Salamanca novel, you will
quickly surmise that it would have benefited from having been made,
say, in the 70s, when the subject of sex didn't face the threats of
censorship and the National Catholic Office.; And how is it possible not to fathom Lilith when its
depth is considerably lower than one's own crotch?; Seberg was never much of an actress to begin with, and
it's unfortunate that she was chosen over other actresses considered:
Sarah Miles, Diane Cilento, Samantha Eggar or Yvette Mimieux, who might
have been the most rewarding."
157823.0,Night Moves,1996.0,"This excellently scripted film by
Alan Sharp, captures the mood of the country at the time among many who
felt they survived Vietnam, the JFK assassination and the White House
scandal, but still feel weary and uncertain about the future, as it
seems as if no matter what they do or how smart they become, they are
still going around in circles.; This is the best film that Arthur Penn has done.; Harry had searched his entire life to find his father, only, at last,
when he found him living in a rooming house in Baltimore, all he could
do is follow him into the park and watch from a distance as he read the
funnies, never even attempting to meet him.; He empathizes with Delly,
feeling they are both loners who can't fit into normal society and he
wants to know why she was killed.; He soon
discovers there is a smuggling racket of pre-Colombian art taking place
that involves Tom and Paula, which they kept secret from him.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; From Joe Ziegler, an older
stuntman on the set, he figures out that Delly probably went to the
Florida Keys to live with her stepfather Tom Iverson, who is running an
airplane charter service there."
158762.0,King of the Wind,1994.0,"Eventually, Sham, which is owned by the Bey of Tunis (Ian
Richardson from Masterpiece Theater's excellent series, ""House of
Cards"", ""To Play the King"", and ""The Final Cut""), is made part of a
group of horse to be sent to the King of France as a gift.; KING OF THE WIND (1989) is set in North Africa in the year 1727.; If you want to see a
great story about horses, try BLACK BEAUTY (1994).; Pretty much what you think will happen does.; On board the ship,
disaster strikes, as it always does on board ships in stories like
this.","The direction by Peter Duffell and the screenplay by Phil Frey and
Leslie Sayle based on the novel by Marguerite Henry takes no risks.; I can not
recommend this show whose only claims to fame are that it is about
horses and that it is for whole family.; Even my amiable son Jeffrey (age 7), who tends to like every
single movie he sees, found it kind of boring.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
159569.0,Home Page,1991.0,"Granted, this is fairly simple stuff but Block
finds creative, personal ways of presenting it, until we begin to get a
more thorough understanding of the web's significance and its meaning
in all of our lives.; Through everything, ""Home Page"" always leads right back to the life of 
Justin.; >From here on, the film branches off on several different paths, as we meet 
other web site fanatics, including a few of the employees at Justin's former 
intern job at HotWired, such Julie Petersen and Carl Steadman.; For some it is
a way of life, for others it's but a mild diversion, but it has
something for everyone.; The film's focus isn't just on Justin; indeed, we become intimately
familiar with some other interesting people such as Rheingold himself,
Julie (http://www.awaken.org), Justin's former honcho at HotWired (a
web magazine where he was an intern), as well as the people behind
Suck, a popular, satirical internet publication.","Why make a film 
about something, and then not even attempt an effort in exploring that topic?; The film becomes increasingly annoying as we are
familiarized with one pretentious maverick after another,
virtually none able to put together a sentence without a surfeit
of empty verbiage and a clutter of hollow, unnecessary fillers.; 1999 - 102 minutes
Not Rated (equivalent of an R rating for profanity and brief nudity).; The documentary is so poorly
lit that the images are frequently indecipherable and background sounds
sometimes drown out the speakers.; Not Rated
(the equivalent of a mild R for profanity, brief nudity and general
weirdness)."
159810.0,Caravaggio,2000.0,"At the very least I'd say that this is a must for art-lovers and
students, for people interested in off-beat film and theatre and
visuals.; His original way of
shooting a biopic (highly personal but still factual), whereby
Caravaggio's most famous works are recreated with actors who are filmed
in a style true to Caravaggio's chiaroscuro paintings (the artist's gift
to the art world), makes for a one of a kind film.; Jarman creates an
inspiring visual atmosphere for Nigel Terry's brooding artist portrayal,
of the artist on his death bed.; The film captures the turbulent nature of the artist, accurately showing
his inventive art technique (the basis for current movie lighting
techniques), and it relates how the low birth artist still had so much
anger in him even as he grew in status and how he always painted in such
a feverish pitch, always the passionate artist.; It also shows the
influence of Jean-Luc Godard, especially the 1982 film PASSION.","To add further references to his vile character, he kept a
deaf/mute child as a slave and lived in such a lavish style that he
squandered all his money.; The anachronisms are not visually
intrusive.; It has
wretched excesses, ""longueurs,"" claustrophobia, calculated distancing.; No rating.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

160068.0,Gloria,1997.0,"Reviewed by Harvey Karten, Ph.D.
 Columbia Pictures/Mandalay Entertainment
 Director:  Sidney Lumet
 Writer:  Steven Antin
 Cast: Sharon Stone, Jeremy Northam, Cathy Moriarty, Jean-
Luke Figueroa, Mike Starr, George C. Scott ""Gloria"" is a lot like ""Guys and Dolls,"" one of the great
musicals ever produced on Broadway, a hit that captures the
characters andthe vernacular of its thoroughly urban Damon
Runyon characters.; Lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life 
painting.; Lumet is no stranger to the streets of New York, having walked the
territory in films sush as _Dog_Day_Afternoon_ and _Serpico_, and the look
and atmosphere of _Gloria_ bears a gritty authenticity.; Directed by Sidney Lumet.; Directed by Sidney Lumet.","Lumet, whose talent peaked
25 years ago with ""Dog Day Afternoon"" and ""Network,"" throws in one
amazingly sloppy car chase, but otherwise does nothing to perk up the
picture's sluggish pace.; The film's few action scenes are sluggish and dull.; The repetitive nature of the script could have been made
somewhat bearable if it built to an exciting climax and resolution, but
there is neither.; 3) She
hobnobs with friends of Kevin drawing killers to her front door.; Unable to commit to being a thriller or a character study, the movie
settles for being an excitement-free drag."
161495.0,Roommates,1996.0,"Either way, this is still a good movie and you should 
give it a chance like I did, whether you hate your roommate or not.; Check local listings and, then on Monday
night, sit back and enjoy the most exciting evening of the year, when
Mujibur & Sirajul host the 67th Annual Academy Awards.; Parents may appreciate the refreshingly inoffensive story, but it's a
long sit for the rest of us.; Forget WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, this is the Allen homage to beat!; Sure, the film
gets heavy-handed in spots--as well as a bit too tidy toward the
end--but the warmth of the source material still shines through.","Don't even bother to bring a brain.; Even without the college element, I still decided to watch 
ROOMMATES because I had absolutely nothing to do, unless you 
count studying for final exams (And who does?).; Three flat-mates, one body, and a suitcase full of money are the
motivations behind this tepid thriller from Scotland.; So when I saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie 
called ROOMMATES, I envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a 
couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room.; Scratch that 
idea."
162416.0,Go West,1998.0,"""Go West"" is both charming and entertaining, and
deserves better than its obscure status.; It is nearly
the equal of the much lauded ""Sherlock, Jr."",
although it doesn't approach the depth of Keaton's best
film, ""The General"".; ""Go West"" begins much like other Keaton
comedies.; Not to be confused with a 1923 short also by
Buster Keaton having the same title, ""Go West""
is a comedy, western and romance.; But Friendless' true love is Brown Eyes, who saves
his life from a rampaging bull.","The owner is visible upset, thinking Friendless is
indicating his daughter.; Plot contrivances result in a herd of cattle rampaging
through city streets.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
163883.0,Bandits,1988.0,"While the Willis-Thornton comedic chemistry clicks, Cate
Blanchett delivers a deftly daffy, richly funny and volcanically sexy
performance, the kind that deserves Oscar attention.; But life gets
more complicated when they take a hostage, Cate Blanchett, an unhappy housewife
who's giddy with delight at their antics, falling in love with them both,
reasoning, ""I can't choose between you because, together, you're the perfect
man.""; Working from Harley Peyton's screenplay, Barry Levinson's direction is
expertly sharp and funny, including a brief nod to the motel scene in ""It
Happened One Night.""; On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Bandits"" is a smart, savvy,
wickedly funny 8, evoking a quirky, contemporary ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid"" romp.; After a
somewhat confusing, chaotic setup in which they're heisting the Alamo Savings &
Loan in L.A., a flashback reveals who they are and how they got there.","Rated R.  Running time: 125 minutes.; As does Victor Kempster's
production design and Gloria Gresham's costumes which are - to say the least -
outrageous.; To this end, they recruit Willis's cousin
(Troy Garity), a dim-witted stunt man, to drive the getaway car.; ""Bandits"" is overlong at over two hours and repetitive as well:
how often can we laugh at Terry's descriptions of his alleged
brain tumor, his migraine headaches, his twitches, his eye
problem, his tintinnitus?; And the plot is punctuated with interviews on TV's ""Criminals at
Large."""
165188.0,Vacation,1975.0,"this is the best of the NATIONAL LAMPOON 
movies (yes, even better than the Corey Haim-Corey Feldman team-up 
LAST RESORT), the best Chevy Chase movie and the best in the 
travelogue genre.; It's good 
in December, sure, but I watched it in May and still enjoyed it.; Either way, VACATION is a definitive 80's comedy 
you should definitely take a look at (or you could watch it).; But once they get on the open road, the 
Griswold family finds out everything that can go wrong will (Murphy 
Brown's law, right?).; See if 
you can say _that_ about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.","It is incredibly mediocre, 
though, with very few laughs.; National Lampoon's European Vacation (1985) *1/2 This is the worst of the VACATION movies, though it wasn't 
as bad this time around as I remembered it.; Sure, there was no way to 
effectively replace Anothony Michael-Hall, who had moved on to 
bigger and better things (if you don't count JOHNNY BE GOOD) since 
his 1983 role as Russ in the first VACATION, but could they have 
found a worse replacement for the daughter, Audrey, than the 
repulsive porker who appears in this sequel?; Chase's trademark bumbling becomes 
more annoying than amusing here, and the casting choices for the two 
kids in this movie seem particularly bad.; I don't mean to be 
insensitive, but what point is there in casting an overweight teenager 
for a role as a girl obsessed with staying thin, other than flat-out irony 
(which is never even hinted at through the course of the movie)?"

deadlines and personal betrayal, Alex and Elliot end up achieving each other's

just learning the art of screenwriting at a class, he prevails upon

decent out of this mess.; It's as if the main characters sold themselves on the
cheap.; The acting is boring

taxis around slowly.; The script is stale, the
acting is sub-par and misguided, and the cinematography is on par with a
Turkish sitcom."
169627.0,Windhorse,1999.0,"This gives a
poignancy to their natural and realistic performances, and further
adds to the overall feeling of authenticity that permeates the film.; He is compelling as the
weary one, not knowing what to do until something tragic happens that
brings out his best instincts and transforms him to do what is right.; I hope it does reach a wider American audience than what I think it
will, because I  believe that the cause here is just, the acting is
first-class, the film is beautifully crafted, and that all people of
good faith must stand together and give hope to each other, in any small
or large way that they can.; The story will pick up 18 years later when the three are grown, each
choosing different paths.; The film opens and ends on a powerful spiritual note, as you would
expect from a people who value so highly their traditional knowledge of
Buddhism.","The ponderous narration which frames the movie (its
only weak point) informs us that the titled windhorses are
pieces of paper left on the ground to be spirited to the
gods by the wind.; Director Wagner shifts to the year 1997.; If this fictionalized film wasn't about the
real life situation in Tibet and had the same mundane story, I could see
it being criticized for being melodramatic.; They are abetted by an American tourist, Amy
(Taije Silverman), who speaks Tibetan and has a video camera, and is
evidently interested in the ""real"" Tibetan people.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

169656.0,Gorilla Bathes at Noon,1997.0,"The unifying symbol in this film is the eventual decapitation and
tear down of a huge statue of Lenin.; Unlike
its German predecessor, this one never gets off the ground.; This may have been the film's only triumph.; Major Victor Borisovich's soviet officer's unit has ""deserted""
him, leaving him behind in a city still trying to rebuild itself.; Seen: Sun 5/10/93, Palo Alto Square, SF Film Festival
Rating: 6 (scale of 1->10)
Germany 1993, 83 min.","Though initially an engaging hero, the material gradually
wears thin, and the Major starts to resemble an obnoxious Danny Kaye.; It's a high camp, Russian propaganda piece
with outrageously operatic deaths, and closeups smudgily superimposed
over what appears to be a color postcard of the burning Reichstag.; Unfortunately, this film begins to look more interesting than the
modern work that frame's it.; In this tepid soup, it's more like indigestion.; The film has crisp photography, but it's not brilliant enough to
avoid the wait for this turkey to come out on video."
170200.0,Redball,2000.0,"Redball is a head on, confronting and brutally realistic look at the
pressures facing the police who deal with death and street crime every
day, and the toll it inevitably takes.; Some of those
tales have been woven into the plot of this hard hitting and often
unsavoury examination of life on the streets and corruption, whether
it be free sex from hookers or taking a kilo off drug dealers for
private use.; Hewitt used to work in a pub near the Russell Street police
complex, and over the years he picked up many stories about real life
investigations and the off duty antics of the cops.; Despite the
limitations of working within a shoe string budget, Hewitt has made
good use of locations within Melbourne.; But far from becoming another police
procedural, Redball is a morally ambiguous film that lurches through
its unflinching examination of this particularly masculine world, and
the camaraderie that exists between street cops, even when off duty.","However, the overall lack of technical skill and polish behind
this self funded and quickly shot film becomes evident through the
often crude, jump cut editing, which occasionally jars.; It even lacks the
gritty intensity and realism of local tv productions such as Blue
Murder and Wildside.; Hewitt also
lacked the luxury of being able to do numerous retakes of scenes,
which is occasionally reflected in the performances.; Hewitt is a fan of maverick American director Abel
Ferrara, and tries to emulate his uncompromising style with Redball.; The central plot device centres around the hunt for Mr Creep,
a psychopath who preys on young children."
170926.0,Zan Boko,1993.0,"Admittedly you will be disappointed at times, but
you will also discover interesting and enjoyable films this way.; The best film in the festival; 100% camp humor, 100%
pure fun.; However, 
TABATABA was good and THE CITADEL was truly excellent.; Minimalist approach to Charles Dicken's work; very well done.; A look at life in a small Algerian village that is very
interesting and very witty.","The premise is
interesting but the overall result is mediocre.; The film is captivating for the first half, then it
falls on its face.; The problem
with the film is its incredibly slow pace, which will bore most viewers.; Opera stars go cannibal!; Total yuck!"

with their intense devotion to each other and their families but punks,
nevertheless.; ""Gee, what a small, funny world this
is!""; ""I can't
do that,"" the enforcer said, ""Michael Corrente is my little brother.""; Nicky,
Ralph's best friend and cousin, is a small-time cocaine dealer.; Following the well-worn conventions of films like
THE GODFATHER, the plot gets more and more taut as the story proceeds
until it seems inevitable that there will be violence.","Libby Langdon is attractive as Wendy, but she simply
fails to do much with her character beyond what was on the printed page
of the script.; Character development is sketchy at best, with no real growth
apparent in anyone.; In fact, they are drones, completely lacking in any
aspirations.; Especially disappointing are Anthony De
Sando and Libby Langdon, who are frequently unconvincing in central
roles.; ""Oh."
171944.0,Bambi,1999.0,"The character I enjoyed most is Thumper.; ""Bambi"" tells the story of a male deer, from birth to maturity.; He shows
his fatherly ways by ignoring Bambi until he is in trouble,

these activities by his soft-spoken mother, and by a host of
friendly animals, especially Thumper the rabbit.","The first half of the picture is slow, almost tedious.; ""Bambi"" has lots of problems, and has to be considered a
disappointment.; He is shown to be gentle and 
confused in the first half.; The songs completely lack charm,
and are performed by a lifeless ensemble chorus.; Bambi's character is uneven."

in-fighting and dark humour something of a down point then you'll like

Martin to rights, even ex-girlfriend Joan (Lisa Stansfield) is persuaded to
come along for the ride.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Dermot Kierney as the
lottery-winning nutball fails to add to the broth and Nick Mead's
made-for-TV style of direction will do little to impress cinema-goers.; Unfortunately, in a month which sees the debut of such British giants as

177559.0,Lea,1998.0,"As the sullen Lea, Lenka Vlasakova gives a meticulous and delicate
performance.; Existing more in a
metaphorical world than a real one, the bulk of the storyline serves as
a conceit to prepare the viewer for the film's incredible conclusion.; Lea, now living with her adoptive parents, keeps an underground
shrine filled with hundreds of glowing candles as a homage to her dead
mother.; LEA, a GOLDEN GLOBE nominee for best foreign film, tells the
lugubrious story of a woman so traumatized by an abusive childhood that
she remains almost mute for the rest of her life.; After a short series of dramatic incidents, the story jumps fourteen
years later to 1991.","But the story rings so false at every turn that there is rarely
sufficient motivation for the audience to delve into the inaccessible
picture's oblique characters.; The movie is not rated but would be
an R for violence.; Although the filmmaker clearly wants to illustrate utter despair and
the hope for redemption, the movie plays too much as an exercise in
cinematic style to draw one into the story.; Through some financial
maneuverings, Strehlow turns the offer into a non-negotiable demand.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

177792.0,Twelfth Night: Or What You Will,1996.0,"It is easy to turn TWELFTH NIGHT into a rather trivial farce, if an
entertaining one, but Nunn has opted for a surprisingly sensitive
rendering of the tale.; While
this is a comedy, like all good comedies there is a lot of truth in
it.; Kingsley and Smith
make particularly inspired choices for their roles, lending humor both
subtle and expansive, and Richard E. Grant is a perfect dim-witted fop as
Sir Andrew Aguecheek.; Each is good,
and each is downbeat in tone.; TWELFTH NIGHT may be uneven, but is still largely appealing, thanks
to the talented cast and the unique design of the film.","No reason for the updated setting here
is apparent and in some cases clothing details required by the story
just do not fit with the dress of the characters in the film.; Director:  Trevor Nunn.; while the plot thickens.; The first of the problems is that Nunn had moved the story to the
late 19th century for no apparent reason and adding no value to the
story.; An otherwise
mediocre film, TWELFTH NIGHT is saved by a few, *very* few, commendable
touches, particularly Helena Bonham Carter who stars as the Countess Olivia."

this is one story of con men in which the ""men"" are more important than

delightful one.; This is perhaps a cliche situation, but it is nicely papered over by
Paxton's solid, likable presence.; Wiener has
this sweet and innocent smile and twinkling eyes that make her part
compelling without many spoken lines.; The movie has an unusually good and rich (29) selection of songs, some
heard in toto, including the opener, King of the Road (sung by Randy
Travis) and the closer, ""Young Love.""","Worst of all, the

time-lapse photography and another similar effect that involves a sunbeam

year, packed with everything from emotional drama to suspenseful
thrills.; In _Daylight_, Sylvester Stallone breaks no new ground, cinematically
speaking, but he covers familiar territory quite well.; Daylight is a fun movie, and as long as you aren't expecting

beginning and end are quite good, and the supporting characters carry it as

chocolates without any chocolate in them -- he's counting on the high-sex
advertising to sell them to the British sweet-eaters.; There is a long, slow period in the

attack and then will attack them from their vulnerable sides.; There is a certain fascination about this movie that makes
it a moving experience, especially in watching the Zulus perform under
Endfield's direction.; The Zulus never even saw a movie before and it
wasn't until Endfield showed them a Gene Autry oater that they knew what
he was talking about and were able to go along with his directing.; The Zulus are first heard coming as the ground shakes and it feels like

because it has a stellar plot.; The sets were perfect.; BLACK RAIN is a brilliantly directed, visually gripping film, with a good
story and some terrific action.","A waste of talent.; Andy Garcia is appealing as Charlie, but unfortunately his
character is woefully underdeveloped.; A
cheap shot.; If such a hackneyed plot is to be turned into a watchable film by

character drama -- but it also takes on the emotional issue of guilt, and
assigning guilt, in the aftermath of a war.; Nothing spectacular, but a very involving little film from beginning to
end.; He was shipped out without seeing
here again, and has remembers his time with her very romantically.; Towards the end of the film,
Kestner becomes a catalyst for the mayor's political decision, and Lonsdale
reveals information which complicates the web of guilt even further.","Hicks and Cazenove (as a hack reporter who stumbles on Kestner and daughter and
sees a story in it), while doing nothing particularly noteworthy in the acting
category, keep the film from grinding under its own angst every twenty minutes

in the photograph.; He lives
only in a picture taken almost by accident when she met him at a
wedding.","There's nothing remotely surprising about this 
movie, unless it's how embarrassingly bad the resolution is.; He does little apparent work and spends most of his
time romancing women who are already involved.; One would have wished that the writers could have come up with
something fresher.; And the worst part is that the movie could easily have

favorite is ALWAYS (1985) which should not be confused with Spielberg's

deals with Trish and her incestuous relationship with her gay brother
Jake.; The performers, all excellent, have zip, zing and verve.; Jaglom is an independent and a maverick who makes decidedly 
non-Hollywoodian movies, super talky affairs of staged 
""cinema-verite"" (documentary),with players who range from many 
unknown or little known to second-stringers.","Poor Foyt really put herself out on a limb and tried hard,
but ended up looking bizarre and totally ridiculous.; In typical

single handheld camera and too many pans and zooms that leave the
audience dizzy.; As if he is saying, I only make these
art house pictures and although I claim not to care, I wish one would
become a major hit that would make me filthy rich.; Large 
family reunions around Helena's table are done in most 
un-gourmet fashion as food is barely the background and talk 
is all.; We learn that ambition goes so far that a ""gorgeous 
apprentice"" (Nick Gregory) fakes being gay and comes on to

may sound foreign to some, but sounded familiar to me.; It was one of my favorite movies of the 80s.; The women are very funny and
insightful with many great lines.","It is a close call, but I can not recommend the movie because the
main part was too banal and poorly acted.; This part is trite and tedious.; I've tried that - it does no good.; Most of the movie however consists of the awkward acting and
dialog of the shower itself.; The
wheeler dealer subplot is kind of a nice diversion but nothing special."

typical crime film briskness of the '30's with the shaded undertones of the
then developing 'noir' genre, it is actually quite a good film, and in a number
of ways daring for its period.; All of these films are highly recommended.; Fortunately,
""Last Man Standing"" has all the right crew and cast at the right time and
place.; Of course, if you do you will miss out on some
great atmosphere.; True to the novel, literally everyone in the
film is corrupt in some way, and especially fascinating is the appearance of
William Bendix in a minor role of an overtly homosexual sadist of a thug.","Hill tries to make Smith into some kind of introspective
philosopher, but this unbelievable silliness is laughable.; In a completely predictable show, I thought there was going to be
a mildly surprising ending.; Worse, the secondary characters are a poorly-
developed lot, with motives that vary from incomprehensible to merely 
unexplained.; Atmosphere is 
supposed to be a background element, but Hill forces it into the 
foreground, as if attempting to overcompensate for structural and 
plausibility problems in his script.; But as an updated version of the far

nominations for both Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon, and deservedly so.; That's not a criticism; this film is a fine
character portrayal that offers Susan Sarandon as Sister Helen and Sean
Penn as a condemned inmate the chance to develop strong and
three-dimensional subjects.; First of all, I have to say that this movie is, in my opinion, the best 
movie of 1995 and certainly one of those which I won't forget easily.; Directed by Tim Robbins, one of my favourite actors, this film has also 
the brilliant and unforgetable performances of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon.","""Dead Man Walking"" is too far of being an anti-deathpenalty movie.; It's not hard to give away much of the plot for this story, simply because

American Dream.; By holding to a lingering 
gait, the Polish brothers get a chance to show what really counts
in this sort of story--the details: the nervous tics by Sunny's
brother Tracy (Anthony Edwards) whose confidence in the singer
never palls; the assortment of gestures by Sunny's manager Les,
who alternately chews him out and regularly puts their heads
together in prayer before each performance; the small, flashing
eyes of Bobbi, who is positively appalled by her man's desertion
and stunned by the one-dollar lottery ticket he mails to her
religiously every month as child support--sincerely believing he
has a chance to hit the jackpot.; Their first film, TWIN FALLS IDAHO, a love story with
co-joined twins, was one of a kind.; The best piece of work comes from Peggy Lipton (""The Mod Squad"") as a woman
who has a one-night stand with Sunny.; Since Mark Polish, who wrote the screenplay
and Michael Polish who directed the film have
more in common with playwrights like Edward
Albee and Arthur Miller than with the go-getters who appear on
early-morning TV, they take a decidedly pessimistic view of a
scheme by one Sunny Holiday (Jon Gries) while at the same
time providing us in the audience with a sympathetic view of a
man who even believes he has a good chance to hit the numbers
in the lottery.","In other long, uninteresting scenes, Lester offers Sunny lots of unsolicited
advice on how to be successful.; Rated R.  Running time: 96 minutes.; It's never clear what kind of movie JACKPOT wants to be.; Anthony Edwards shows up, and that's about

extensive acting experience, and this is apparent also.; Synopsis:
A young man from Bombay arrives in San Francisco, hoping to gain admission to
college.; Director/Writer/Film Editor: David Rathod
Producer: Cristi Janaki Rathod
Principal cast: Ashutosh Gowariker, Heidi Carpenter, Pearl Padamsee The film is the story of Vikram, a nerdish young man from Bombay, who
comes to San Francisco in anticipation that he will be admitted to U.C.; The film is weak in the following sense.; Naturally, he asks the only
American woman he has met -- a thoroughly obnoxious punkette!"
197655.0,Spitfire,1996.0,"Other Pyun masterpieces include Alien from L.A., Cyborg, Hong
Kong '97, and Brain Smasher: A Love Story.; At times like this, a person is compelled to do whatever it
takes to satisfy their place in the universe.; Among the people
we saw in the preview: Lance Henriksen: He played Bishop in Aliens, and he can now be seen in Fox
TV's Millennium.; The film opens with Charles enjoying a quiet tryst with a lover.; A review by Chris Holland & Scott Hamilton of http://www.stomptokyo.com/ There are times in a person's life when you feel the calling of a higher
power, when the universe reaches out and brushes your cheek to get your
attention.","Unfortunately, Henriksen's performance in this film makes even riding a
jet pack look boring.; It's so bad it's bad.; Perhaps the
worst casualty of this treatemnt is one of Spitfire's running gags, that
is that Charles has left a string of illegitimate children all over the
world who have gone into the intelligence-gathering service.; Learn from this: nudity in a film's first scene is
not a good sign.; This could
have been an amusing subplot, but every time it's brought up, it falls
flat."
198447.0,Mother,1989.0,"She shows strength of character behind a fragile, docile
exterior.; Anyway, somewhere along this
journey of self-discovery, he found himself again and is now happily
married with 2 children.; We are forgetting about the paternal part of the
picture, and the important role of sibling rivalry.; He travelled to Canada and met up with some distant relatives;
traced his heritage back to England; and discovered a war monument of an
ancestor somewhere in Australia - ironically it was a soldier who got
run down by a car before reaching battle.; A friend of mine decided
he needed to discover his ancestral roots before he could reclaim his
identity.","What is there to look forward
to, when the trail left behind is littered with a long succession of
missed opportunities, and the path ahead looks like a much needed face
lift.; So
his character, a divorced middle-aged man with writer's block, journeys
home in search of answers.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

198996.0,Time After Time,2000.0,"It's very well
done, McDowell is great as Wells, the film moves along as you'd
expect it, and all in all, it's an excellent film.; It's very entertaining,
so I tell you, grab a bucket of popcorn, a glass of soda, and enjoy
H.G.; Despite all its flaws, however, TIME AFTER TIME still remains
an entertaining--and occasionally fascinating--two hours, as well as
a favorite among Meyer fans.; The romantic chemistry between the two is great,
and it shouldn't surprise anyone that they transcended their
partnership into real life.; Their argument,
of course, is valid only the movie is entertaining indeed -
conflict between Victorian gentleman and the modern
environment provided excellent opportunity for many subtle
yet effective jokes.","Unfortunately, while this science
fiction/thriller has a premise with tremendous promise, the execution is
hampered by obvious plot holes, inconsistent characters, and uneven
acting.; Most of the
time, that concept was nothing more than a convenient excuse
for exotic, but standard adventures and films without any
ambitions of seriousness.; Flaw in the
characterisation is just one of the many of this film -
cheesy and totally unconvincing special effects, scientific
plot holes and implausibilities, some rather uninspired
lines - that culminate in rather disappointing and ultra-
conventional finale.; It's mainly an
emotionally flat, one running joke type of lightweight literary film
that is done in by a very dull middle section and too much unnecessary
gore.; Indeed, the movie might have worked better had Jack the
Ripper not been around at all."
201196.0,Implicated,1982.0,"Cast: James LeGros, Jennifer Beals, Drew Barrymore, Jon Stewart, Eric Thal.; Jon Stewart, as a 
good-natured man Elizabeth falls for, is a standout.; One of several movies Drew Barrymore made in 1997 that dodged the big screen 
and are only now reaching home video, Adam Park's ""Wishful Thinking"" is at 
least a step above ""Best Men,"" which is also currently available on video, 
but that isn't saying much.; - Copyright 1999 by Dustin Putman

leads are charismatic (particularly Beals, who deserves more film roles), and 
the unorthodox structure is similar to ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Go,"" but the

201287.0,Rude,1998.0,"Virgo's highly
stylized directing is visually riveting and thematically complex.; Meanwhile, I highly
recommend RUDE to anyone with an open-mind, strong stomach, and
not-too-easily upset sensibilities.; The acting is more than
convincing, the sets alternate brutal realism with eerie surrealism
very effectively, and to my untrained eye, the technical achievement of
this film rivals almost anything I've seen this year.; One of the two secondary storylines revolves around a young woman
who must cope with the emotional, psychological and physical aftermath
of a relationship.; It is an exercise in self-deprecation,
an observation of societal-deprecation, and a very plausible attempt to
negotiate worth in a micro-culture that values an escape from pain
above everything, including life itself.","It is unbelievable to me that RUDE could have been filmed for a
reported $350,000 by a first-time director.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

201445.0,Late Bloomers,1984.0,"In its depiction of an unlikely romance, LATE BLOOMERS is touching 
and sensitive.; Of course, once Dinah and Carly come out of the closet, they are 
universally vilified.; For a while, their relationship remains platonic, but Carly and 
Dinah eventually admit their attraction to each other.; LATE BLOOMERS goes over-the-top in portraying the 
homophobic reactions of the townspeople towards the two women.; Her results are mixed -- 
sometimes the two compliment each other, but there are also moments when 
they're at cross purposes.","Every 
anti-gay cliche is used, and the story becomes oppressively 
melodramatic.; There's even an absurd moment when a woman pulls her 
daughter off Dinah's basketball team in the middle of a game because she 
hears a rumor about the coach's relationship with the secretary.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

201724.0,Prince of Central Park,1999.0,"Will JJ find trust after having his self-confidence and ability
to love shattered early in life (as the production notes assure
us were indeed shattered)?; Fortunately he has friends.; While the kid runs
away to Central Park, he is mugged by a somewhat older kid

lad's cash, portable keyboard, medallion, and, earlier on,
even his jacket, shirt and pants.; Reviewed by Harvey Karten

Frank Nasso, Jerry Orbach, Paul Sorvino, Kathleen Turner Usually critics don't discuss the films they've screened as
they leave the theaters but in this case I was perplexed, so I
broke the rules.; Though billed by the company as a modern-day Huck Finn,
""Prince of Central Park"" has as much in common with the
Clemens masterwork as a medieval morality play has with
""There's Something About Mary.""","""Is this movie supposed to be for kids?""; Rosa (Lauren Velez), the caseworker who is piled up with 55
youngsters to look after seems to have time only for JJ.; Major credit should go to the actors who, to a person, were
able to hold back from breaking out into raucous laughter--
though we can guess how many takes were required to get
their serious faces screwed on straight.; This putrid sentimental pap will have any
pre-teen with an I.Q.; (Though Rebecca seems to us like a
loving woman with a strong character, the production notes
inform us that she is ""a woman whose life was shattered by
the frowning of her 14-year-old son.)"
202262.0,Svengali,1999.0,"Evocative,
soundless longshots alternate superbly with the intense light-and-shadow
close-ups.; Seeing Svengali shows a mastering of the new technology after four years.; Luckily, John Barrymore more than makes up for this.; The sets are in the same vein as
The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari and other German Expressionists.; One hilarious noteworthy one
starred Peter O'Toole and Jodie Foster,  in which he declares, upon
hearing her sing, ""She has a voice like raw meat!""","Marian Marsh, as Trilby, is dreadful.; This resulted in many awkward scenes with everyone talking into
telephones, or even vases.; One was

word credibly.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

203609.0,Here on Earth,1957.0,"This is an old-fashioned love story.; Klein stars as Kelley Morse, a Princeton-bound rich kid who, as the film
opens, learns that his father won't be able to attend his graduation
ceremony because of an important business trip.; Greenwood plays both stock roles of
the town sheriff and the grieving dad to a T, and Harnett truly shines
as the most human character of the entire group.; That way, as I come out of the movie, I can be pleasantly
surprised.; Hartnett is touching in the `other guy' role and holds his own with his
contemporaries.","The awful script was penned by Michael Seitzman
(Farmer & Chase).; It's just too bad that Michael Seitzman's soap-opera script is so lame, Mark Piznarski's direction so slow-paced and prosaic, and Andrea Morricone's score so schmaltzy.; Earth is yet another early entry into my `Worst Films
of 2000' list.; Rather than play the vicious jealousy card, writer Michael Seitzman
chooses instead to give Sobeiski a terminal illness, and from there the
movie proceeds to its achingly predictable climax.; If theatres had windows, I would have jumped out."
204732.0,Nadine,2000.0,"""Nadine"" is a surprisingly original and entertaining film.; NADINE provides such a rare experience.; Torn was the best
feature of EXTREME PREJUDICE, and his departure early in that picture was
lamented by many critics.; There were several things about the film that I liked.; NADINE is set, and mostly filmed, in Austin, Texas, which I've
had the pleasure of making my temporary home this summer.","Meanwhile, Basinger is trying to recover nude pictures from
a slimy photographer.; Bridges merely needs Basinger's signature to finalize the
divorce, so he can marry his new girlfriend.; In another
scene, Basinger and Bridges are forced to crawl across
a splintering ladder spanning two high buildings.; Since the action
takes place in 1954, the filmmakers ""fiftyized"" several Austin locations of the
proper vintage to be used for the exterior shots.; You can pay real money for this one, folks."
205361.0,Boycott,1994.0,"The film's power is in its nightmarish presentment of prison life, where the
captive is trapped with brutal prisoners and government police officials who
both want to capture his soul.; The film is a rambling, action-packed Hollywood style (for the most part),
surreal, and politically motivated thriller--with car chases and shootouts.; He has reinvented himself as a director and has
since received international acclaim for his unique films, and is the most
popular Iranian filmmaker along with Abbas Kiarostami.; He's
tortured in his interrogation and hopes to avoid further cruelty by going along
with whatever his jailers want of him, but finds he's caught by those on both
sides who won't let go of him and he can't find a way out of his dilemma.; The film gets its title when all the political
prisoners he was once friendly with completely ignore him, at the request of
their leader, for not still being committed to the Marxist party line.","The film never convincingly showed Valeh as anything but a political lightweight

206161.0,Sally Marshall Is Not an Alien,2001.0,"Sally Marshall Is Not An Alien is aimed at young female
audiences, who may identify with the two lead characters and their
dilemma.; Although
Pip wonders about the strange noises and lights that come from the
Marshall's backyard shed every night, she thinks the new girl is
basically harmless.; Eventually a friendship develops between these two girls who are
considered misfits by Rhonnie's ""in-crowd"".; Against her better
judgement, Pip finds herself spying on Sally and her family.; Her
family move in next door to young Pip Lawson (Helen Neville), who has
an interest in astronomy, and hopes to discover a new comet.","However, this well
meaning film is let down by some uninspired direction from
Adelaide-born Mario Andreacchio (Napoleon, Paws, etc).; The adult characters fare even worse as they are given little to do.; Andreacchio
specialises in entertainment aimed squarely at family audiences, but
apart from the far superior The Real Macaw, his films seem to lack any
sense of sophistication and polish.; Audiences
looking for something a bit more exciting or inspiring would be
advised to give this rather disappointing film a wide berth.; Former soapy star Peter O'Brien (Neighbours, etc) lacks impact as
Pip's understanding father, while all the others are virtually
relegated to the background, and make little impression on the
material."
207278.0,Armageddon,1995.0,"The visual style of the film
is often quite effective, though, so bring along some Dramemine and enjoy
the ride.; It's a brilliant plan
and identical to the one in DEEP IMPACT.; Certainly one of the better summer flicks.; Because we're all human beings and as
such relate more easily to stories that are on a human level.; It also had some good
characters and some very funny character driven scenes.","The movie is filled with bad science (some objects on the asteroid act as if
they were in Earth's gravity), incomprehensible ideas (NASA sends giant
machine guns into space?); Amongst the characters, NASA guy Dan Truman (Thornton) Bruce Willis, and a
whacked out Steve Buscemi provide any interest,  while the rest of the
characters are boring, 2-D stereotypes, the kind of characters Bruckheimers
films specialize in.; Worse than that, this shameful sequence has no bearing on the rest of the
movie.; Stamper brings
in his team of misfits to learn how to be outer space heroes and they're a not
exactly the guys that NASA would have picked to stick in the shuttle to save
the world.; If you want characters that are even
remotely complex, or a plot that doesn't exist for the sole sake of
special effects sequences and cardboard manipulation, then please look
elsewhere."
207608.0,Dinosaur,1994.0,"And an
entertaining movie with a moral is always a good bet for a family
outing.; Its message that survival of
the fittest is a brutal misconception, while standing together and
cooperation - the mighty protecting the weak - makes for a more viable
and stronger community, is a lesson the children will easily grasp.; Finally, there's the rousing score by James Newton Howard, his best (and
most memorable) since 1994's Wyatt Earp.; Sweeney), who is raised by a loving
family of lemurs after his egg is displaced (in a truly spectacular
wordless opening sequence).; But they are just pieces in the larger puzzle that is
Aladar's coming of age, a tale that Disney has told in more entertaining
and emotionally satisfying ways in films past.","At least that
would be original, which is more than I can say for the script which is so 
lame and boring it just keeps
wandering for most of the film without much characterization or point.; I mean, *talking* lemurs are bad enough; d'ya really expect me to swallow
the lemurs talking before their proper time?; I know
Dinosaur is a kid's movie and I know you're not really supposed to argue
logic with kid's movies, but I just can't turn off that part of my brain
like Di$ney wants me to.; Of course, kids might like it because of the whole dinosaur angle,
but geez Disney, why did you have to make it so boring?; As a movie, it's dull."
207941.0,Alice,2000.0,"This Alice is an innocent on the cusp of discovering
herself.; And that feeling is a lot stronger with ALICE.; The title character, played brilliantly by Farrow, is a modern,
upper-crust, neurosis-ridden Manhattanite interpretation of the Lewis
Carrol Alice.; Allen is
well-known to be a major, major jazz aficionado, who, like Mantegna's
character, Joe, plays the sax and who has a record collection that is
reliably described as fantastic.; She
brings a guileless honesty to her role, a deadpan serious to the hijinks
and fantasy that makes them all the more delightful.","I rate this
one a disappointing low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.; It was surprising the film was
at all watchable.; In spite of the fact that Yang is
benevolent, this is all Fu Manchu stuff, and Allen should be ashamed to
write it into a film.; This is a film that has an intriguing concept and a terrific cast, yet ends
up as dry and uninteresting as its title.; And a single scene is all that many of the
name actors got in this effort."
208128.0,Independence Day,1987.0,"This is the greatest summer movie ever.; This is a great roller-coaster ride of a movie.; It's fun, loud, tense, exciting, action-packed, and it will keep your
attention for two and a half hours.; ID4 succeeds
fantastically.; I repeat, this is the greatest
summer movie of all-time.","Instead, they created a story full of one-dimensional characters, absurd
coincidences and laughably uninteresting interpersonal conflicts.; Director Roland
Emmerich completely redeems himself after the dreadfully boring Stargate.; What makes INDEPENDENCE DAY so
frustrating is that its complete failure as a story does not appear to be
the result of laziness.; All that money
spent...and by all evidence, not a dime of it went to a good script
doctor.; Even the film's self-promoted nickname,
""ID4,"" evokes TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY's ""T2"" campaign from a few years
ago."
208958.0,One Night Stand,1984.0,"The first act is great.; Kiniski
is great as Karen.; Skip One Night Stand in the theatres and if you want to see a third of a
good film or a great performance from Robert Downey Jr., check it out on
video.; This first act shows the characters
well.; After seeing Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas, I was expecting a lot from One
Night Stand.","The writing, which originates
from a Joe Eszterhas (Basic Instinct) script, is mediocre at best.; I'm sad to say that I'm sorely disappointed with One Night
Stand.; In a freak coincident Max meets up with Karen again through a predictable
plot twist.; And
though I enjoyed the first third or so of the film, the rest of the film is
somewhat unbearable and the plot twists are completely predictable and
silly.; I think that Figgis' is trying too hard to make his films
""different"" and it shows."
209269.0,Felony,1998.0,"I thought it couldn't fail because of the dandy cast of character

explosion, but has his assistant/buddy, who looks a little bit like Bruce
Dern but isn't, promise to retrieve the all-important videotape.; And for that matter, so is that
shirt you're wearing, Lance.""; This film is really starting to
get on my nerves.; Anyway, Knight manages to film the massacre
of all the policemen by some thugs led by David Warner (groovy character
actor #1).","There's a passel of great actors here and they aren't doing
shit with this boring rotten script and leaden direction.; Just cut out a
few of those really stupid car thingies where the car goes leaping up into
the air and falls over like a bowling pin for no discernible reason, and
you'll save enough money to do some rehearsals and rewriting and such.; Basically, I leaned on the fast-forward for the rest of the film, and
determined that evil was defeated, good triumphed, and there was a window
left open for a SEQUEL - NO, PLEASE NOOOOOO!; I am
bored.; Look, these actors could ad-lib a better movie than this!"
209961.0,Love and Death,1994.0,"It's hard to imagine a Mel Brooks movie inspiring a Woody 
Allen movie, but I'm convinced that's exactly what happened with 
LOVE AND DEATH.; Riding on the coattails of that 
film, Woody released LOVE AND DEATH the next year, his only 
foray into full-scale parody territory.; This is all mostly a setup for Woody to work in his usual 
one-liners and sitcom-like situations.; Being Woody, he's also in love with her, 
but she doesn't return the feelings, opting instead to be more 
promiscuous than Papa Karamozov himself.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","He 
also must have been watching too many ""Get Smart"" reruns 
because his comedic delivery here is almost identical to that of 
Don Adams.; Woody plays a Russian thinker who has pseudointellectual 
debates with his cousin Diane Keaton, who by this point had 
adopted Woody's mannerisms.; No other Allen film 
has quite so many dreadfully bad jokes.; Yes, Woody's done his take on just about every type of 
movie, but LOVE AND DEATH is a direct parody of Russian 
literature like BROTHERS KARAMOZOV and DR. ZHIVAGO with 
liberal rips on extentialist philosophy thrown in.; This movie is 
loaded with the cheap sight gags the JAS parodies are known for, 
but it's also the only Allen film where serious dialogue is overdone 
to the point where it becomes funny (a la Leslie Nielson) and terrible 
jokes and puns abound (again, Nielson's films come to mind)."
215644.0,Roxanne,1997.0,"Certainly the funniest movie I've seen in years, and good family stuff, I
think.; More
important was my affection for Edmond Rostand's ""Cyrano,"" which has always been
a favorite of mine.; It adds a great deal to the film, and
meshes nicely with the main story.; Instead, he broadens the humor and makes Cyrano de Bergerac--renamed
C. D. Bales--perfectly at home as the ever-perfect chief of the world's most
incompetent fire department.; These are
mostly sight gags, and very funny ones.","Along comes a strapping hulk of a fireman, Chris, to join Bales's
fumbling department.; She really has eyes
only for Christopher, a handsome but vapid new recruit to the fire
department.; Unfortunately, Martin's
     script cops out at the end, denying the audience the power of
     the end of CYRANO.; His old problem is that he
has an absurd-looking four-inch-long nose.; In addition to the jokes based upon Chris's ineptitude and C. D.'s nose,
the screenwriters have added a subplot not in the original."
216191.0,Act of Violence,1988.0,"The hunter-hunted motif is

asked about the worth of his business, he says 20 thousand dollars, a 
small fortune then, peanuts today.); A 
warm, highly praised movie, it was mostly known only in film 
society-type circles.","There are asides, 
embellishments or ""fioriture.""; As a result  ten men died horrible deaths.; Where the story goes from there I cannot reveal except that it

216720.0,"Forbidden City, U.S.A.",,"Overall, I'd say that this film is well-worth viewing, especially since
it's shown for free on PBS as part of the series ""The American Experience.""; And I
find myself enjoying the movie FORBIDDEN CITY, U.S.A.; I think Arthur Dong, the director, succeeded in communicating the feelings
that being an Asian-American singer and dancer was indeed ""forbidden"" in those
times.; The Forbidden City nightclub was packed nightly during the war years.; The recurrent theme is the frustration resulting from being
denied opportunities in life because of arbitrary stereotypes set by one's
society.","Being a jazz-singer or a tap-dancer just didn't fit the stereotypes of
Asian-Americans held by American society.; These same stereotypes have led many
Universities to apply quotas on the number of Asians who are accepted because
there are ""too many"" of us, to the point that an Asian student with a 4.0 GPA
was denied entry at UC Berkeley.; And what would happen if someone decided
that they'd made a mistake?; The effect is like calling Connie Chung
the ""Chinese Barbara Walters"" or I. M. Pei the ""Chinese Frank Lloyd Wright.""; Or was it?"
217642.0,Easy Rider,1998.0,"Fonda, Hopper, and their temporary girlfriends
enjoy a nude swim in a mudhole before our anti-heroes return

surreal drug trip, that works surprisingly well.; We find that commune life is better in theory than practice.; ""Easy Rider"" is different from most films, before or since.; That night, Nicholson
has his roach, which he forgets to smoke as he entertains
Hopper with a wild tale of how Martians have been integrated
into American society.","There is also a lack of focus, with everyone passing time
idly in small groups.; There isn't that much conversation.; Hopper is again paranoid and wants out

coke from a Mexican, then selling it to Phil Spector."
219951.0,Saigon: Year of the Cat,1999.0,"Still, he
does get into the spirit of the thing once Saigon really begins to fall apart,
and he stages some very memorable scenes in the U.S.  Embassy, as the last
Americans are pulling out in panic.; The North
Vietnamese are on the move, the South is cracking up, the American ambassador
is living in a fantasy, all the Vietnamese who cooperated with the Americans
are beginning to panic, and the CIA agent (surprisingly more hero than villain)
fears that his country will put things off too long and leave all their friends
to the mercy of the Communists.; Contrasting that is the fine performance
Frederick Forrest gives as the reluctant CIA agent.; His cinematographer, Jim Howlett, abets
him in this well, and also gives Forrest's performance a lift by cleverly using
shadows on his face to suggest the darkness and secrecy of Forrest's world.; MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE showed his
talents to much better advantage than SAIGON--YEAR OF THE CAT does.","She shows no energy, and fails to make the audience see
why it should care about her life.; In addition, the script assures a slow
start, since nothing really happens until an hour into the film.; Alternately, they could have made some attempt to make her an interesting
person.; In this film, though, the heroine is
not only unlikeable, but also tedious.; If writer David Hare and director Stephen Frears had
been willing to jettison this boring narrator they might have had something."
220346.0,In Love and War,1943.0,"O'Donnell is bravely
spirited as Hemingway and Bullock has a keen sense of duty and maturity
in her role as the caring nurse as she is several years older than
Hemingway and this movie is based on a true story.; Based on the book 'Hemingway In Love and
War' by Henry S. Villard, James Nagel and Mackenzie Astin, this movie
develops its characters very well as we come to know their
personalities and overall human qualities.; It is an
exceptional visual experience as the landscapes of Italy and Canada
serve as the film's location points and are very well photographed.; The Venice locations create a glowing
romantic setting, and Bonucci turns in a nice performance as the stiffly
chivalric suitor.; Even when they seem to be coming together, Agnes and Ernie find the war
separating them, leading to a difficult choice for Agnes.","IN LOVE AND WAR, a thoroughly mediocre attempt at an intimate epic,
suffers the added disadvantage of extraordinarily bad timing.; O'Donnell is even worse trying to play the disillusioned sot
Hemingway becomes, when his raging outbursts seem more like petulant hissy
fits, but by that point no one in the audience will care much about him
anyway.; Unfortunately, this
picture has some very big flaws such as neglecting the presence of its
supporting players which has plagued Attenborough throughout his
directorial career.; Unfortunately, the locations are shot flatly by
Roger Pratt, a couple of the battlefield scenes are dropped in like
sympathy-seeking mortars without a moment of set-up, and Fenton's score is
as loud and relentless as any theater's sub-woofers could withstand.; It is one thing that O'Donnell is trying to play Hemingway
with a youthful naivete; it is another to be playing an Ernest so earnest
that he comes off like the guy who would get wedgies in grade school."
220724.0,Armageddon,1997.0,"This isn't poetry, but it's
still a lot of fun.; It's an 
enjoyable ride, but Bay, who tames his frenetic touch in the beginning, 
restarts it again at the end, causing the film to be a big collage of 
fast-paced images.; Contrasted to the fact that this
man may well never return to realize happiness with his son and the
woman he has loved, it's a powerful, pivotal message.; There's a lot wrong with the movie if you think
about it, but it can be enjoyable.; Just check your brain with the usher and enjoy the ride.","What all this boils down to is poor script writing.; During the space sequences, bad lighting mixed 
with Bay's frenetic editing makes about a good 30 minutes of the movie 
almost incoherent, with running cameras on blurred images.; There isn't 
much of a plot, simply because Tyler and Affleck don't carry the same 
kind of chemistry needed to produce a decent subplot.; There was only
10 minutes focus on that story, and neither actor
nor actress could pull it off believably.; All of the
characters were so cheap and terrible."
223259.0,Crinoline Head,1947.0,"Boasting perfectly-chosen songs from indie punk bands, including Everready
and Tiltwheel, and an eerie score by Michael Borwegen, ""Crinoline Head"" works
surprisingly well as both an outrageous black comedy and an always-engrossing
horror movie.; Brian Kelly (""Freakshow""),
as Paul, is also very good, as is Tommy Faircloth himself, who has a
wonderfully bright, likable screen presence, as the celery-obsessed Bodhi.; An unadulterated, genuinely fun movie from beginning
to end, ""Crinoline Head"" is a motion picture not to be missed by horror buffs
everywhere.; Since then, I have watched the movie
countless times, and have enjoyed it immensely upon each viewing.; It isn't an artistic triumph, but it is one of the most
consistently entertaining, impressive indie horror films to have come out of
the '90s.","1995 - 85 minutes
Not Rated (equivalent of an R for violence, profanity, and some gore).; The
house belongs to Derrick's (Richard Abbott) family, and the invitees include
Robyn (Liz Taheri), a wholesome young woman who pines for Derrick from afar;
Cathy (Billie Fontanez), Robyn's tomboy best friend; Trish (Cathy Slaminko),
a stuck-up bitch who wants nothing more than to become a member of the
sorority headed by the ditzy Jenny (Tracey Powlas); Paul (Brian Kelly), a
quiet, mysterious type; Greg (David Garone), a rich boy who hates the
outdoors; and Bodhi (Tommy Faircloth) and Mark (Steven Lee), roommates who
speak and act like male Valley Girls.; This feeling is made
no more palpable than when dealing with Cathy Slaminko, as Trish, and Tracey
Powlas, as Jenny.; Directed by Tommy Faircloth.; Also making an impression are Billie Fontanez and Liz Taheri, as the most
down-to-earth people in the whole movie, Cathy and Robyn."
223307.0,Over the Edge,1998.0,"Highly
recommended especially to anarchists and sociologists.; The teens know the parents are there, and
(this is truly memorable) lock them in the school, eventually
turning off the lights and mocking them over the PA system.; ""Over the Edge"" is a disturbing film that depicts the lives and
values of teenagers, and their conflicts with parents and authority
figures.; This is the first film for both Matt Dillon and Vincent Spano,
who have moved on to become successful actors.; But I doubt
that they have ever been in a film this good again.","Clearly the director sympathizes with the teens and not the
parents.; Meanwhile, the ""Over the Edge"" teens torch and smash the 
parents cars and fire guns into the air.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

223318.0,Let's Talk About Sex,2000.0,"The fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the
more melodramatic moments in the film.; There's lots of graphic, titillating talk, which bears a
striking similarity to reading aloud the raunchy walls of a public
rest-room, as the trio come to terms with their own sexual
problems.; But it does.; Troy Beyer's directorial debut (she also wrote and stars)
offers plenty of the bawdy talk the title promises.; (opens September 11) Michael Dequina

rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","Terrible writing, terrible acting, terrible
direction--terrible film.; These scenes grow worse and worse, culminating in an absurd climax.; What's worse, these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy.; The script suffers from random plot developments.; I can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about
their ""likes, dislikes, skills, and thrills,"" but on the whole, it's pretty
bad."
223438.0,Dance with Me,1992.0,"The slightly
cool Ruby and the fiery Rafael (and, for that matter, Williams and
Chayanne) strike immediate sparks, but these two opposites truly ignite
when they dance together, generating a palpable sexual tension and
electricity with their sizzling salsa steps, nimbly choreographed by Daryl
Matthews and Liz Curtis.; As the deadline to the National Finals looms closer, hints of romance
begin to bloom between Rafael and Ruby.; He
also pulls off a humorous and original tribute to Gene Kelly from
SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.; As obviously choreographed as some of the
""spontaneous"" moves in the club might be, it's still infectious to watch
when Rafael seems to be having so much fun.; He's great looking, dresses impeccably, dances like a
machine, and radiates great sensations with his full-toothed smile.","This would be nothing more than a bunch of
dance sequences strung together by something that could only be called a
plot if you were being particularly generous.; Matthews also wrote the screenplay, and, frankly, he is overextended.; If the point was to
prove how much more exciting club dancing is than regimented competitive
dancing, that point is made and made again for nearly half an hour,
including ridiculous comic relief from Joan Plowright as a spunky
geriatric.; No cheap
sex scenes either.; The muddled,
cliche-ridden soap opera story, written by choreographer Daryl
Matthews and directed by Randa Haines (""Children of a Lesser God""),
revolves around losers becoming winners as the competitive beat goes
on, culminating in the predictable, show-stopping dance-contest
finale."
224507.0,Drop Dead Gorgeous,1990.0,"Kirstie Alley is terrific
as the scheming pageant overseer and Ellen Barkin gives a funny
performance as Amber's very troubled mother.; Denise Richards gives a wonderful performance as the snotty Becky
Leeman; while I'd have to say that her performance was the most
outstanding, I also liked most of the others.; This is clever, although admittedly not always very intelligent satire.; It's no small admission to say that ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" is the
funniest film I have ever seen.; Gorgeous isn't quite the word I'd use to describe the film but it
*is* drop dead hilarious.","You can't possibly take the things as zany and stupid as this 
seriously so don't bother.; In taking pot
shots at rural hollowness, director Michael Patrick Jann does
not even opt for the miscarried outrageousness of Harmony
Korine's plotless dud ""Gummo""--about poor white trash in a
desolate Ohio town whose citizens get their jollies from
shooting cats and selling the bodies to the local supermarket.; I thought it would 
be a good idea because then I'd be able to review that movie before it was 
released nationally, but when I got in line the manager said the theater was 
overbooked and those who couldn't get in could go see whatever else was 
playing for free.; To spoil any one of
the myriad of jokes would be irresponsible.; I heard really bad things from 
some of my fellow Internet critics and actually thought it'd be a good idea 
to see a bad movie because I haven't ripped into a film in a long time."
224677.0,Last Dance,1996.0,"When we first meet 
him, he's a brash lawyer looking for a handout from his brother (Peter 
Gallagher), the Governor's chief of staff.; Throughout most of the film, there is a believable, 
haunted look in Stone's eyes, and the questionably-structured conclusion 
has power largely because of the way she reacts to events.; After taking Cindy's case 
for the Clemency Board, he becomes a crusader, not so much against the 
death penalty but for her life (although the film's message is clearly 
anti-death penalty).; With three stays of execution by a sympathetic judge yet
little hope for ultimate mercy, Stone's character is one that is beaten and
broken and ready to die.; In this 
film, the death row inmate is Cindy Liggett (Sharon Stone), a woman 
tried and convicted for the brutal beating deaths of two high school 
kids.","Unfortunately, Rob Morrow doesn't display enough 
depth as an actor to make Rick a real person -- there are too many 
scenes where he comes across as flat.; Veteran Australian director Bruce Beresford (BREAKER MORANT) is no stranger
to plots centering around civic injustice, but he plays this outing way too
safe, failing to inject any life or depth into the proceedings.; Unfortunately for the producers of LAST DANCE, this
capital punishment movie fails to generate enough interest even to raise
the question ""Is this *that* woman's story?""; If there
was an opportunity for originality or creativity here then Beresford missed
the boat.; Her 
character doesn't have much of an arc; his does."
226109.0,Once Upon a Forest,1990.0,"I enjoyed THE LITTLE MERMAID, was enthralled by BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST, and had a lot of fun watching ALADDIN.; With its recent three animated features, Disney has proven that
animation capable of entertaining adults (as well as children) is not
dead.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Those going to this film expecting to see
a Bluth-quality motion picture are in for a rude surprise, although
it's a mistake Twentieth Century Fox would like to see repeated over
and over again.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","The story is pathetically thin, even by the limited standards of
an average five-year-old.; The
movie is dull and shows an obvious lack of innovation and creativity,
but for those desperate to take their kids to a ""suitable"" movie, this
one will fit the bill, although it might be better to wait a few weeks
for the re-release of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES.; Children will enjoy this movie the way they
do Saturday morning cartoons, finding it mildly entertaining but
nothing special (does that make it worth an admission price?).; Remember last year's disappointing FERN GULLY: THE LAST
RAINFOREST?; However, while
FERN GULLY could at least claim the asset of Robin Williams' vocal
talents, ONCE UPON A FOREST is stuck."
226594.0,Jerusalem,1997.0,"During the course of the movie, both 
undergo traumatic transformations as they cope with who they are, what 
they believe, and how powerfully capable they are of hurting each other.; Overall, however, these are minor blemishes upon an 
otherwise remarkable and thought-provoking motion picture which rewards 
viewers with an experience that is both emotionally and intellectually 
enriching.; Give credit to Pernilla August (the director's wife, who 
previously appeared in his THE BEST INTENTIONS), Ulf Friberg, Sven-
Bertil Taube, and especially Maria Bonnevie, whose tortured portrayal of 
Gertrud is one of JERUSALEM's strengths.; In the end, JERUSALEM pursues redemption, but not in a traditional 
sense.; Ingmar is closer to Gertrud than he 
is to his own sister, Karin (Pernilla August), who is a decade older and 
married.","This could be the result of the heavy 
editing that was necessary to condense a Swedish TV miniseries into a 
theatrical release of manageable length.; The same 
is true of Ingmar, who commits at least one vile act in his quest to 
obtain a lifelong goal.; Shortly thereafter, Hellgum departs for 
Jerusalem, where he intends to set up a paradise on earth for his 
followers, who are to wait a short while then come after him.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

something that isn't a challenge."
226749.0,Northern Lights,1962.0,"I highly recommend that if this film comes to a theater in your
area that you miss it.; It is mostly narrated by one of these farmers who is trying to
help the Nonpartisan League  get started.; NORTHERN LIGHTS was first released in 1978 and has never made it to
videocassette.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","90 min., not rated, Drama, 1978, Black & White
Directors: John Hanson, Rob Nilsson
Cast: Robert Behling, Susan Lynch, Joe Spano, Ray Ness,
      Hellen Ness, Henry Martinson NORTHERN LIGHTS is, in my opinion, an incredibly boring film, an
absolute waste of time!; It is
filmed in grainy black and white with mostly just talking which gives it
the appearance, at least, of being a very cheap film.; I saw NORTHERN LIGHTS at my local art/import theater and I can
easily say that it is one of the worst films I have ever seen.; On a scale of zero to five, I give NORTHERN
LIGHTS a *big* zero.; I personally
feel that nobody,even if you are interested in this period or the
Nonpartisan League, would like this film."
227430.0,Split,1994.0,"I was very
pleased that the film is on the side of individualism and personal freedom!; The intellectual issues raised
here are worth pondering; our society is filled with ""social activists"" who
want us to trade our freedom for their ""visions"" of a better world.; On an intellectual level, the film deals with the split between
individualism and conformity to society, and personal freedom versus
totalitarianism.; A fast-paced science
fiction film, filled with computer graphics.; Some of the transitions from scene to scene are not so smooth.","Some of the outdoor photography is rather poor and
grainy.; Special effects fanatics may want to
skip it - perhaps they should watch the big budget summer sequels instead!; However, the film had a budget of only $300,000, which is tiny compared to the
millions spent on films like the latest STAR TREK.; If you care more about
special effects than plot, or if you require that the special effects be ""the
best"", i.e., comparable to those in, say, STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME, or
ALIENS, then you should not see this film!; The police forces are lead by a man (played by Director Chris Shaw) who
progressively changes from human to machine as the movie develops."
227557.0,Living Out Loud,1988.0,"DeVito gives a typically superb performance as the confident but vulnerable
Pat.; And 
DeVito has never had such a humanistic role before, which I was 
surprised about.; Living Out Loud does have plenty of good moments, and overall it is an
enjoyable film to watch.; Despite its problems, the story is still enjoyable.; ""Living Out Loud,"" with its quiry characters
and poignant situations, is one of this year's best examples of
adult romantic comedy: a solid choice.","Even the camera-work was dull.; As if the humiliation
of losing one's husband to a younger woman isn't enough, a
thirty-four-year-old ""younger woman"" only adds insult to injury.; Pointless.; I didn't, so the
film just seemed to drag for me at times and it seemed manipulative, to
the bargain.; Why they were sad and lonely, is a sympathetic enough story, but
there was just nothing served up that made me feel that this predictable
story had anywhere important to go."
227772.0,Wolf,1980.0,"Yeah, but slightly different angles and even a
little sad at times, although most of it is great humor.; All the pieces fall into place
and yet we're asked to accept that the cops will continue to hunt down
the innocent.; The most visually striking sequence to grace a Mike Nichols movie
thus far is the opening one for WOLF.; It's so moody and enveloping, and
augmented by (finally!); However, because of the opening,
and because Nicholson's darting eyes and brows are being utilized most
fittingly, WOLF maintains a hold.","The special effects were also a little tame compared to
most ""metamorph"" films and was sort of disappointing.; What's the point of a
remake if they don't?; cliche??; We give in because
he's our idea of a capricious satyr.; The climax and ending cheat us out
of the sophisticated wrap we all deserve: it's a criminal waste to have
stars of this magnitude in this day and age surrendering to the call of
the wild."
228218.0,Blind Date,1997.0,"Peter Schouten
http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/7574  ---> Visit Celluloid Comics Today!; He presents a strange
talkshow on a local tv-network in Amsterdam en makes movies only he wants
to put money in.; Maybe,
just maybe, he'll make a good movie someday.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Instead of improvising everything there was actually a screenplay this time,
but the dialogues were written by a child actress with one movie to her credit.; She has wonderful
lines, but as a whole, this could have been a nice 25 minute short, instead
of a feature length movie.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
229746.0,She's the One,2000.0,"**** Amazing, potent stuff.; Her part is actually relatively small, but she gets some of
the best and most poignant scenes.; In the
spirit of ""Brothers,"" this film works in the same manner by starting out
simple but gradually becoming more complex by developing characters and
multiple, overlapping storylines which all make for interesting, offbeat
themes.; THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN's greatest appeal lies in its quiet, unforced 
portrayal of reality.; The one-liners are both the strength and the weakness of the film.","SHE'S THE ONE, on the other hand, 
is just a waste of good Tom Petty music.; Acting, like poor character identification, is another area where 
SHE'S THE ONE falls down.; His dramatic range appears limited to mild
annoyance and affability, and Burns the actor can't bring to the screen
whatever hidden passions Burns the writer might have put on paper.; It's mix of
cheap cariactures, smug jokes, smarmy romance and unlikely coincidences
is grating more than anything else.; With his sophomore effort, SHE'S THE ONE, Edward Burns has made
another movie about Irish Catholic brothers that do stupid things to the
women they love."
230100.0,Buddy,,"This being a
true story makes it all the more heart breaking.; Remember Bambi, and how Bambi's mother gets shot towards
the end of the movie.; Sad as this may be, the audience is fortunately
spared the gruesome details of what actually follows a kill - the
division of the spoils into venison, and a wall mount for her head.; Fortunately, children are
spared the unpleasant details of how she will likely be her off-springs
first meal after they hatch.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","We all know he's out of his habitat, so
return him to the jungle, and save us from this 'ape-to-adolescent'
theatrical.; By Jo I was PETRIFIED, even after watching 'George of
the Jungle', which actually endeared me to the great Apes.; Sure they may grow up to be anorexic or psychopathic,
but at least they won't grow up to be like this baby gorilla.; Dressing animals in
clothes and pretending that they are your children, is very unnatural.; Children will be very frightened of gorillas by the
end of this movie."
232175.0,Gimme Shelter,1993.0,"The best place to end this review lies in describing the quiet
melancholy of a single unbroken shot.; They smoke, fiddle with
their boots, and sit staring at the walls of the recording studio as the
song carries on.; And the two concerts had many things in common.; Though this happens several days before Altamont, it
works as an eerie prediction that something great is coming -- great and
terrible and strange, and the Rolling Stones will have no choice but to
hurry up and wait.; However, ""Gimme Shelter"" is a
fascinating film.","Oddly enough, it'd all be just a fun (and forgettable) road movie
leading up to an aggressive and hip ""alternative to Woodstock"" were it
not for the shots of the Rolling Stones sitting around the editing
console watching the aftermath and inevitability of the Altamont
tragedy.; The handheld camera moves around, capturing poorly
lit, washed out images of dejected youth, bummed out rock stars and a
wild performance.; Mick Jagger really isn't much of a live performer, overly concerned with
his appearance, forcing eccentric ad-libs.; Even during the warm-up acts, the Hell's Angels,
foolishly hired as security, are clubbing concert
attendees, especially those rushing the stage or
messing with their motorcycles.; The movie lacks focus and feels rough and tumble, hastily thrown
together and forcing its ""death of the '60s"" theme by rushing through
the murder finale."
233758.0,Romeo and Juliet,1993.0,"McEnery's Mercutio was a complex and bizarre reading that fit the
spirit of the character perfectly.; All of the supporting cast were excellent, but Pat Heywood, John
McEnery, Milo O'Shea, Michael York were especially brilliant.; I love the theme song
and still hear it being played today.; A more romantic and realistic rendition of the
nature of love, I have never seen.; When he
presses Juliet's hand at the dance, it is more erotic than many a scene
today where the actors are all buck naked.","It just doesn't fit his character.; Hussey and
Whiting basically faded into oblivion.; Also
with: Pat Heywood as a robust nurse and Michael York as a cocky,
pugnacious Tybalt - one of the reasons I couldn't take the 1996
version seriously was because Tybalt reminded me of a kind of Ferris
Bueller from Hell.; With Olivia Hussey as Juliet and
Leonard Whiting as Romeo he had the basic ingredients, but just having
the right cast does not a masterpiece make.; The only major
actor was Laurence Olivier who was the narrator."
235776.0,Clubland,1999.0,"When Willie's one decent money-making act quits, the Walters boys become
even more outwardly hostile toward each other, while simultaneously growing
closer on the inside.; Rubinek, an actor last seen on the screen as Nic Cage's boss in Family Man,
packs his second effort - Club Land - with more of the same long, unedited
shots and stunning jumps from scene to scene that made Jerry so enjoyable.; The
hitman dramedy, adapted by Rick Cleveland (an occasional writer and producer
on The West Wing) and based on his three-man play, was a competitor at the
1998 Sundance Festival, and then later that fall at Montreal and Toronto,
where it played to strong reviews.; He also stars in the film, playing Stuey Walters, a Korean War vet
who is forced to go into the family business - talent management.; All Rights Reserved.","The only thing remotely interesting here is going on behind the camera.; It wastes
the talent of Alda (who looks like he's having fun, for some reason) and
Happiness' Louise Lasser, while accentuating Weber's complete lack of
aptitude.; That's right - Jerry went
straight to video.; Weber writes about as well as he acts, which dooms Club Land from the
get-go.; ""You look like you fell out of a bum's ass,"" he yells at Stuey, who seems
more content scouting skirts than talent."
242291.0,Working Girl,1993.0,"Although the movie may not generate much in the way of deep drama or
high comedy, it succeeds beautifully as a fairy tale.; Tess and
Jack like each other immediately -- each sees the other as a wonderful
relief from the run of the mill they've grown accustomed to.; Griffith gives a
solid, even impressive, performance as the intelligent, ambitious, and
resourceful secretary who wants to raise her social stock.; After so many films and so many bimbos it's
wonderful to see a gutsy, intelligent woman.; Ford is outstanding in his
role as a bumbling and ruffled, but charming, bachelor.","(As if this wasn't bad enough, she returns home from this
humiliation to find her boyfriend being unfaithful.; Another movie would have made Katharine unpalatable
from start to finish; Katharine is very likeable when she's on screen --
she's just doing the wrong thing, and sees it as being business as usual.; Weaver's character is written so on-the-edge that it would
have been an unconvincing cartoon in the hands of a lesser actress.; Her company holds out
the carrot to her that she may someday get a better job, but it is clear
from her modish mini-skirted dress, her excessive jewelry and makeup, and
her long hair that she is just not the type of person who makes it into the
upper echelons.; Rating: low

of the gate each year.; Thank you for your support
and we hope that you enjoy our next film.'; more than any other type of film.; Despite not being an overly innovative movie, it is still pretty
innocent, brainless fun for big beefy men - something which fans of big,
beefy action would most likely appreciate.; William Forsythe plays the bad guy, a mass murderer who has several
million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak.","Very disappointed.; Unfortunately, the 
same cannot be said of his first star vehicle, FIRESTORM, which is just 
plain awful.; (At least I hope there 
aren't 10 worse films than this.); Most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor
Howie Long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly
performing.; He's worse than a generic bad guy; he's a 
boring generic bad guy who doesn't have any snappy one-liners to hurl at 
Our Big Burly Hero."
245266.0,Coma,,"Genevieve Bujold
was very well cast as a heroine of this film.; Perhaps that, more than everything else,
makes this film so scary and so effective after all those
years.; She portrays
Doctor Wheeler as a liberated, professional woman of 1970s,
strong and stubborn, and yet vulnerable because of her
physical limitations.; Acting talent in this film is excellent.; Which, of course, makes this film even more scary.","The other actors mostly fill
the blanks - Michael Douglas is, at best, passable as her
romantic interest.; That time period was very fruitful for many movie
directors who had made many great films, only to deliver
disappointments in the latter decades.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

position, and her voice erupts in chanting spasms.; Four years ago, before Phil got voted out of office, Jeff Avalle
(Charles Newmark) got hold of some erotic drawings that Renata had made.","In writer and director Juliane Glantz's WILBUR FALLS, the characters are
all quirky, but none are interesting enough to care about.; It is as if
first-time writer and director Glantz wanted to get every idea she ever
had into her first movie.; The body of the movie, which you might expect to be about her
worrying about being discovered and about what actually happened, is
instead packed with a series of unrelated subplots.; She
wants a little revenge before she leaves her old high school campus.; High school valedictorian Renata Devereaux (Shanee Edwards) is an
accomplished scholar with enough extracurricular activities to her

school's musicals -- to make it easy for her to get into the college of
her choice."

is the fact that the central characters are all black and Hispanic.; This entertaining film is chock full of Chris' musical numbers,

his group, The Ladies.; And despite the fact that
Marcus (Seth Gilliam, OZ) hasn't ever had a homosexual experience, he
insists on being HIV-tested every month (by Loretta Devine, Urban
Legends) Most of Punks centers on Marcus' relationship with his new neighbor, the
hunky (but straight) Darby, a successful music producer new to the west
coast.; Patrik-Ian Polk's Punks is about a tight-knit group of four gay men (or
`punks') looking for love in West Hollywood.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Instead of feeling celebratory, Hill (Dwight Ewell, Hooper X

makes a flat mess even of the model's superior dining room 
scene, where rotten fish was served.; Even when copied, those 
sections always manage to do something stupid or cheap.; But she lacks the wispiness, the 
convincing frailty and ill health, the helplessness, the 
pathetic religiosity of Vera Clouzot.; Where the original's 
Meurisse was a diabolical, malevolent snake, Palminteri is

(Luigi Amodeo), and hangs out with an new acting superstar (Michael A.
Goorjian from SLC Punk!)...; Art House comes along as a very pleasant surprise when I was just
expecting another sloppy mess of depressing ideas.; He's written a new script called Art House, which he gives
to his hipster friend Weston (Chris Hardwick) to do a rewrite."
253412.0,Everest,1998.0,"This may not be the best in the Imax series, but certainly is
enjoyable.; For starters, anyone who has never attended an IMAX screening has
missed out on a new kind of amazing movie.; ""Everest,"" the finest IMAX documentary to date, captures all of that, 
along with a portrait of nature at its most awe-inspiring.; So, as you can imagine, the image
on an IMAX film is about as perfect as can be because it has 16 times as
much resolution of the standard films you see.; While the tale of Ed Viesturs climbing Mount Everest (for the fifth
time) is a good one, the story of the eight people from another party
who got stuck on the summit during a fierce storm  and died  almost
brings you to tears.","Nothing would suffice in making a movie about the tallest mountain
on earth than by showing it in the largest format on earth, as well.; Breashears amazes us
with helicopter flights, climbing shots with the camera mounted looking
down, crossings of ice glacier canyons with the camera pointed into the
dark endless hole below, and many other things that would and can make a
viewer sick to the stomach but also amaze them to the point of verbal
""oohs"" and ""ahs"".; After all, why fool around with Bunker Hill when
you gaze at Mount Everest--even try your skill at climbing a
mile or so?; There
is also some wasted (in the sense that the Imax format did not contribute)
time detailing Norgay's desires to follow the accomplishments of his father,
in an attempt to construct a narrative for the story.; The Great America theatre is mediocre at best, wowing
the audience with a large screen and some decent sound."
253933.0,Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole,1998.0,"TRIPLE BOGEY
shows that a pure flight of imagination made by a film maker for just
$350,000 can be so valuable in cinema.; The plot then follows the story of the current set-up and mixes the
extraction of what happened in the past with the current changes that
are going on in the lives of those aboard the boat.; +2 This fascinating little film takes place on a 120-foot motor yacht
that circles Manhattan and is home for three children whose middle class
parents were killed at the end of a summer of bank robberies while
holding up a golf foursome.; The story is told as a screen writer
interviews the protagonists and associated parties to get a feel for the
lives and what led up to the death on the golf course.; This film is fun; its whole premise is unbelievable and as you
learn more about the characters and the lives they leave the become even
more unreal, and yet there is a feeling that given just the right
circumstances it would all be possible.","The film starts with an interview with a literary agent who by a
fluke of lunch appointments took a phone call from a 13-year-old girl
with a book.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

254630.0,Bored Silly,1999.0,"The boys also engage in a lot of Macaulay Culkin-style
screaming and frequently are called upon to laugh uproariously at their
own zany antics.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.; In truth, they only got the ""clean"" part right.","""General Spanky,"" however, was much better than ""Bored Silly,""
which follows three 8-year-olds (Evan Gabriel, Seth Fjersted and Shaun
Poremba) as they try to build a fort, go fishing, make enough money to
buy some ice cream, get revenge on a neighborhood bully and spy on the
mysterious junk man, who reputedly chopped up six kids.; After about 90 minutes and before the plot's loose ends can be
tied up, ""Bored Silly"" comes to a screeching halt, almost as if
Shallcross ran out of money before he could shoot a suitable finale.; Perhaps writer-director Robert Shallcross had an idea to
make a modern-day version of the ""Our Gang"" comedies (popularly known
today as ""The Little Rascals""), but he seems to have overlooked the fact
that those films were short subjects.; ""Bored Silly"" strings together a collection of fuzzily
photographed and seemingly improvised sequences, slaps kooky songs such
as ""I Really, Really, Really Like Girls"" on the soundtrack, and calls
itself a movie.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
254723.0,Snow White,1996.0,"What made me interested in watching
this film as an adult is the curiosity to see the ruthless and brutal
nature of the story itself and today's interpretation.; Although tension remains between the two women as Lillie grows up, things
remain civilized, until nine years later, when Lady Claudia finally
becomes pregnant with a boy, a possible heir.; The prince in this film is not a prince, but a
physician and family friend Dr. Peter Guttenberg (David Conrad).; Unlike the cenored and sugar-coated Disney version, the Grimm
Brothers' collection of folklores and fairy tales are quite bloody and
dark according to today's standard.; Snow White --
Lilliana Hoffman grows into the beautiful little girl her dead mother had
wished for.","I was really growing impatient by then as
the whole thing seems to be a disappointment afterall.; The actings are at best mediocre, except for Weaver, who carries subtlety
and complexity in the first half and throughout her transformation, but
unfortunately goes over the top as her character turns hopelessly evil and
insane.; This
deviates from the original story's theme about female rivalry and fear for
loss of youth and good looks.; I was bored by the predictability and weirdness;
I started to doubt about the point of remaking a well know fair tale.; The last
20 minutes or so has shadows from ""The Terminator"", ""The Abyss""
(""Breeeeeath!"
255411.0,Singles,1999.0,"There are no piss-off scenes or
tear-jerkers, it treats a breakup in a more believable way than most movies
of the sort.; The
way this is shown is both typical and original: typical because scenes like
these happen all the time, but original in the way it is portrayed here with
the actual flirting games.; I saw the move SINGLES last week, and I liked it ... as
entertainment.; By the film's conclusion, after Matt gets to know
what it feels like chasing a girl who ignores him, he comes to his
senses and says the magical words of 'God Bless' you, when she sneezes,
so that they can get together again.; The grunge rock scene was fun to watch, the characters were more likable
than not, there was a lot of tenderness shown for those who get hurt in
relationships, and the film is emotionally as sweet as pie.","There was nothing special about
their up and down relationship, as it was very predictable.; Sheila Kelley's stock character is sketchy and dull, of one who will do
anything to get a man.; Cliff's not worth the
trouble... or is he?; The working
characters should have obviously had less free time and more constraints
on their lifestyle than their ""non-working"" friends.; Singles

256311.0,Stereo,1992.0,"David Cronenberg once had ambitions to be an ""obscure science fiction 
novelist"" prior to his film-making career, and it shows through in these two 
trial works, which are so similar to each other and yet so distinct from his 
other films that they cannot help but be discussed together.; STEREO has much in common with its nominal companion piece, CRIMES OF THE 
FUTURE.; I don't think this is 
misjudgment on Cronenberg's part.; It's about time: 
after two features and two hours of calculation, Cronenberg is ready to put 
his obsessions to more direct work.; They have identical running times, the same cast, and share the 
same filming approach (silent with voice-overs added) and visual sense 
(people continuously framed against architecture).","The only purpose of the male survivors is to formulate, research, and 
experiment.; In fact, STEREO rejects the notion of film 
as a medium of communication and sets out, almost as a put-on, to alienate 
its viewers instead: Cronenberg is more interested in framing his 'actors' 
within chic, modernist buildings than providing his visuals with any human 
impetus; the lengthy silent passages give us a rest from the unwieldy 
narration but do not serve to clarify what anyone in the film is feeling; 
and the only real 'action' sequence, in which someone is chased through a 
building, is no more than a psychic projection.; As a kind of punchline, the film 
ends inconclusively, with the narration stating that all the events we have 
seen in the film are in need of yet further analysis.; There is no live sound, but a voice-over spoken by different 
narrators who sound as if they are taking turns reading from the same 
medical journal.; The storyline - if it can be called that - describes an 
experiment by a research facility in Ontario to accelerate telepathic 
abilities among a group of young subjects."
261188.0,Running on Empty,1997.0,"RUNNING ON EMPTY is one of the best films released this year, an excellent
family drama with strong performances by Judd Hirsh, Christine Lahti, and River
Phoenix.; The actors are very 
believable in their roles, and the film has an emotional intensity that caused 
quite a few tears in the audience I was in.; The movie also touches on the values of the 60's generation in conflict
with the traditional views of that time, and how the 60's generation have to
deal with similar conflicts with the children of their own.; One powerful scene
where Annie Pope meets her father after 15 years of absence is worth the price
of admission to the film.; The movie is not so much a chase story with the Popes running from the
law, but rather deals with the Popes' fugitive life style and the effect it has
on their two sons.","The explosion inadvertently
blinded and paralyzed a janitor.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; I would
give it a +3 on a -4 to +4 scale."
261715.0,Affliction,1999.0,"Highly Recommended.; For instance, I
thought that when I finally saw the hyped-up Oscar-winner, ""The
English Patient"", I would hate it, but it was excellent and
enjoyable.; Adding to the effectiveness of the picture is the simple, yet perfectly 
realized, music score by Michael Brook, and the blustery, atmospheric 
cinematography by Paul Sarossy, which grows to become an effective 
metaphor for the isolation that appears between the characters.; Despite its superb performances, this is a bleak film about one
of life's dissolute losers.; Coburn's portrayal is, in many ways, more scary than most
manufactured monsters shown in some of the most sinister horror and
science fiction films.","This is some of
the worst narration I've ever encountered -- it's ham-handed,
condescending, theme-spewing nonsense, provided by a peripheral
character as if he's the center of the film.; Either Schrader ran out of money to show us all this significant
material, or he ran out of ideas regarding how to do it.; Finally, the
narration becomes absolutely insufferable, summing up every theme from the
previous two hours in a few tidy sentences that makes you wonder why you
spent your time with Wade instead of his self-appointed shrink.; Gone are the
pearly whites and blow-dried hairdo; Glen ""Pops"" Whitehouse lacks
vanity.; Initially, the narration is simply florid and unnecessary; later, it
begins to repeat entire scenes just completed, as though afraid we might
have just walked in from the lobby and missed something."
262216.0,Stuart Bliss,1999.0,"The story opens well with some good, subtle humor.; Soon
everyone seems out to get him.; STUART BLISS, by first-time director Neil Grieve, is a black
comedy with the emphasis on the darkness.; Although it has sporadic
touches of humor to temper the descent into madness, the monotonic
story written by the director and the movie's star, Michael Zelniker,
takes a relentless approach.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","With
the vacant stare of a zombie, Stuart movies through the picture like an
automaton.; Why the
director created a stick figure lead is the movie's real mystery.; With actors playing multiple roles, the movie tries to confuse the
audience in much the same way that Stuart is befuddled.; A
little variety in the acting, some real emotion, and a few laughs would
have helped enormously.; Is this all a paranoid delusion, or is he onto something
big?"
265760.0,Death of a Salesman,2000.0,"Hoffman and Malkovich
also won Emmy awards.; No matter how many other successful plays
Arthur Miller may have had, he will always be
remembered for bringing Willy Loman to life.; But now Willy's dreams are shattered.; The film was also
nominated for Best Picture.; If most folks live a life of quiet
desperation, Willy has graduated to the next
level.","The title gives away the ending, and
casts a gloomy pall over an already depressing
storyline.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

doesn't happen here."
266049.0,Breakdown,1996.0,"All in all, Mostow crafted a great film here.; So I did enjoy this tense tale of driven fears.; The driving stunts appear to be
genuine which not only adds to the tension, but is a refreshing change
in this age of sterile, computer-animated action scenes.; His Jeff is an everyday Joe, clearly scared by increasingly bizarre
and frightening circumstances.; Walsh, Our Favorite Heavy) stops and offers them a ride.","Instead, it just turns out to be merely average.; Throughout the whole film, he looks
angry (or just pissed off.); The ending tries to
be bleak, but just comes off annoying.; Throughout the whole film,
she looks dorky.; That is to say, he does not come across as some
wisecracking action-movie hero."
266069.0,Fantasia,1997.0,"The best of the vignettes takes place following the Mickey one.; And
that's what makes it one of Disney's best, if not it's best
cinematically.; I've watched it 
countless times over the years and believe it was part of the 
foundation of my love of classical music.; The
cartoons are fascinating little vignettes, all unique, and each one
interesting and hypnotic.; This fantastic little bit is then interrupted by chimes and a lot
of light from above, where the souls march into heaven set to Franz
Schubert's beautiful ""Ave Maria.""","How silly.; Films don't 
move masses.; The third one seems like it's just the oligatory use of Mickey Mouse's
fame.; The only movie they could think of was a silent film by 
D.W. Griffith, Birth of a Nation, which had a scene about the 
KuKluxKlan that the author believes changed national thinking 
about the KKK.; There's a bit of a break between these two little Acts (the film's 2
hours long, there had to be a little intermission), and we get to see a
little pointless thing about a sound wave which makes, you guessed it,
sound."
266626.0,Tango Argentino,1999.0,"Their teamwork has brought
one of the year's most compelling performances to the screen.; After his father gets a promotion in a music academy, with strings
attached, Nikola steps in to center stage to hold things together.; In a sense,
each of Nikola's charges finds their own ""tango,"" or dance of life.; With Life imitating Art,
this wonderful performer grew stronger and stronger as the film
progressed, and his doctor's new ""prescription"" is for Aleksic to make
more films!; That knowing is the film's
ultimate gift.","Date Released: not yet (no distributor)
Country of Origin: Yugoslavia/Serbia
Running Length:   1:33
Rating: none.; The gift of Goran Paskaljevic's direction prevents this
from turning into sappy, sentimental sop like SMALL CHANGE.; I'm doubly burdened with such a mission by TANGO
ARGENTINO, as there is no distributor.; He'll stop at nothing to build a stable financial base for
his family.; Director Goran Paskaljevic chose
12-year Nikola Sarkovic from over 800 boys."
267227.0,Blackjack,1998.0,"My favorite line has to be ""I
have to go after.; Maybe if it comes on
Cinemax sometime, and you've already seen Hard Boiled a gazillion times, check
it out.; Jack, at his apartment,
is told that his casino-owner friend has died in an accident, and he is now
the daughter's guardian.; This quickly and thankfully takes a back-burner when Jack is agrees to help
out a friend in need by protecting a supermodel from a stalker.; Yes, the color white.","The plot is cliched, predictable, and worst of all,
really really slow.; Plus, he's played by a
horrible actor, which only serves to make the character more of a cliched
joke.; Not even Hard Target was this weak
in the action department.; Capsule:  Other than a few fleeting seconds of glorious coolness, this
suprisingly boring John Woo actioner simply falls flat.; This stalker seems to have access to high-tech surveillance
gear and a buncha inexplicable biker henchmen."
268674.0,Shadow Boxers,2000.0,"Even if you dislike the sport, you'll
still find the film enjoyable and entertaining.; But the real draw to Boxers is the way Bankowsky pieces together the
boxing scenes.; She describes the sport as addictive and all-consuming,
telling stories about other fighters who abandoned their men and their
children to pursue success between the ropes.; Beautiful and well spoken
(at least for now), we see Rijker gain both confidence and credibility
with each opponent she faces.; Boxers isn't a first-round knockout, but
it's probably a second-round TKO.","There is another fighter who gets some quality screen time toward the
beginning of Boxers.; The only
other knock I can give the film is the repetitive score provided by DJ
Zoël, a former MTV Latino VJ.; Jill `Flyin' Lion' Matthews, a diminutive,
smart-mouthed (at least for now) boxer who turns pro after winning her
division of the Golden Gloves, facetiously asks if her makeup is messed
up when she steps out of the ring.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

third of five films that they made together.; The film was also nominated for its sets.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Will

271078.0,Georgia,1970.0,"GEORGIA tells the story of two sisters who love each other deeply.; This
movie is filled with riveting performances, and I recommend it to you.; Nevertheless,
the love the sisters have for each other shines through this adversity.; He and Georgia's
husband Jake (Ted Levine) are excellent in minor but important roles.; She tells her audience
at a concert that, ""In the dark we're all scared.","Sadie is an awful singer with a scratchy and irritating voice.; The other, Sadie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), is an extremely
ambitious but mediocre and unsuccessful singer whose specialty is
singing her sisters songs - badly.; It is correctly rated R for heavy alcohol and
drug abuse, bad language, some nudity, and a little sex.; That's fine, I guess, for those legions of people who enjoy
watching this sort of spiraling self-abuse.; She is a thin woman who
made a point of losing even more weight for the part."
271340.0,Life,1996.0,"The film pulls no
punches in getting it's way to your heart, and it proves that life,
though not always beautiful, is always worth living.; The two develop a strong rapport that carries the
movie.; And for all of the white overseer's bluster, he's
frequently more friend than foe.; But LIFE is
still one of the year's most unexpected surprises.; Like LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,
LIFE's characters try to provide humor and dreams to get them through
their suffering.","It's a commendable effort by two performers best known for more
simple-minded material; it's just not a very successful one.; The other inmates at the prison (including Obba Babatunde, Bernie Mac,
Miguel A. Nunez Jr, and Bokeem Woodbine) are meant to be colorful and
interesting, but not enough time is spent with any of them.; We never
learn their stories, and they all end up as mere generic convicts.; For much of its duration, Life falls back upon the tired and
predictable formula of the odd couple-buddy comedy, as the two stars
trade barbs and one-liners.; Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence are talented 
enough to make some of this tripe work, but for the most part, ""Life"" is 
formulaic, obvious and very slow."
271969.0,Ben-Hur,1999.0,"Shot on 65mm super-widescreen film, it is one of the most resplendent
films you'll ever see (check out the new DVD release if you don't
believe me -- it also includes a documentary about the making of the
film and a commentary track by Heston).; This was directed by legendary stuntman Yakima Canutt
and is excellent.; Lavish
in its presentation, it ranks highly as a favourite among fans of the
biblical genre while critics over the years have had mixed feelings
about it.; Messala's dirty tricks, especially
the spiked probe, adds much dramatic tension to an
already exciting sequence.; That vengeance, as any moviegoer knows,
takes place on the chariot course in a sequence so famous, dramatic, and
long it consumes 10 chapters of the film's 61-chapter DVD release.","The
story is far-fetched and lacks proper editing.; The film might have been more fun with offbeat casting
(Robert Mitchum?; Even as an
(ostensible) adult, I'm torn on the film.; Instead, I'll sit back and take my place in
the stands for that thundering chariot race.; Scratch that."
273899.0,Stonewall,1995.0,"Another is that, in addition to having a heart, STONEWALL 
isn't afraid to have fun, which is a welcome change from the agenda of 
many grim, gay-themed motion pictures currently floating around the 
international film festival circuit.; STONEWALL is not intended to be a history lesson; the time frame 
and setting are necessary to the story, but they are subordinate to the 
characters.; Matty has fled the homophobic backwaters of Hicksville to find that 
things aren't that much different in the Big City.; The 
believability of these two anchors the film, preventing STONEWALL from 
ever becoming too outrageous or seeming too preachy.; From the beginning, it's clear that STONEWALL is different from its 
more traditional, straight counterparts (films dealing with the black 
civil rights movement, for example).","Depicted from another

     engrossing and enjoyable film that tells its story without
     any wrong moves.; Not yet threatened and for now perhaps the best-liked of the Cajuns is
Belizaire, a healer, a fast thinker, and a real character.; In a story worthy of Mark Twain--in fact, reminiscent in some ways of
PUDDIN' HEAD WILSON--we have a story about an ethnic group rarely seen in
films, yet a story that will be meaningful to every minority and should be
enjoyable by just about anyone.; That is, they run a little-known film that got almost no theatrical
play but is a good film anyway.; But Belizaire's
cousin has been given a writ of exile by the vigilantes and Belizaire is
quickly being pulled into the fray.","It seems to me that I had heard it recommended but it sounded kind
of artsy and dull.; I'm slow!); Well, I guess in the same sense I can claim BELIZAIRE THE CAJUN as a find of
sorts.; (What can I say?; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

boring stories ever written.; Irritating music score and a laughable ending.; You're thinking that
it's just going to be another ""Death Wish"" clone where the father hunts down

277682.0,Anastasia,1994.0,"Absolutely beautifully animated,
wonderfully scored (by David Newman), and brilliantly brought to life,
ANASTASIA is better than any of the last four Disney animations combined.; On the good side this animated musical offers a
superb cast, great acting and singing, and fantastic and realistic
artwork.; Ryan is perfect as the perky yet strong-willed princess, and John
Cusak's voice suits the charm of Dmitri quite well.; This is perhaps the best
animated ensemble Hollywood has ever offered, full of likeable, unique, and
refreshing characters who genuinely come to life on the screen.; But small quips aside, ANASTASIA returns us to classic fairytale territory,
brimming with hope, dreams, a sincere love story, and a surprising level of
action.","become increasingly
forgettable, and even worse, the story loses some steam.; But even 
more sadly Bluth's work in the 1990s - `Rock-a-Doodle' (1991), 
`Thumbelina' (1994), `A Troll in Central Park' (1995) - sank to an 
insipid banality far below Disney ever at their worst.; It
just seems a shame that ANASTASIA _had_ to become a children's film when
this material could have been turned into a spectacular drama unencumbered
by cute puppies or talking bats.; Rasputin could have been a wonderfully complex, religious character but
instead appears cliché and predictable; appearing every so often just so
the heroes of the story could have someone to fight against.; It would have been much better had
Rasputin never even been used, or at least been portrayed as a mortal
character."
277804.0,Sirens,2000.0,"The acting is top-notch.; The story is subtle, but
deftly told, and set with a good sense of place.; The greatest strength is a cast of characters who all feel
like real, thinking, feeling human beings.; Tara Fitzgerald, who played Nancy
in HEAR MY SONG, gives an effective rendering of a woman caught between
two worlds.; Hugh Grant and Sam Neill are both
excellent as friendly adversaries.","It would have been easy to take the cheap route in a movie which
contains so much nudity, and it would have been easy to take cheap
shots at religion by making the vicar a twit or a close-minded prude.; Not only are these weightier
portions of the script at odds with what the rest of the film is trying
to accomplish, but they're too sketchy and incomplete to add anything
noteworthy to the overall story.; They are to attempt to persuade
Lindsay to withdraw something called ""The Crucified Venus.""; The Church dispatches an English minister (Hugh
Grant), accompanied by his wife (Tara Fitzgerald) to try to persuade
him to tone down the brazen nudity found in the artwork.; There is an underlying current of mean-spiritedness that
feels inappropriate in a film striving for a light tone."
277934.0,Only You,,"There they meet Peter, a shoe salesman,  who pretends that he is
Bradley ... and the fun really starts with many twists and turns and
one delightful surprise following another.; When, as Faith, she meets up with Peter (Robert
Downey Jr.) another handsome, non-grunge, and he needs only one glimpse
to fall completely in love with her, we are delighted for them.; Marisa Tomei is so pretty in a non-Hollywood way, so wholesome and
lovable that you just wish you could hold her in your arms and live
happily ever after.; Rounding out the cast are Joaquim De Almeida, Fisher Stevens,
Billy Zane, Siobhan Fallon, John Benjamin Hickey and Adam LeFevre.; Maybe that is what we need right around
now after so many heavy films, something we can just sit back and enjoy

Lillian and Sam's relationship, which treats the love between two elderly
people more respectfully than any movie since ON GOLDEN POND.; Intermeshed with the fate of the hotel and the slice-of-life humor, there
are three love stories.; She is surrounded by such

seem real.; There's nothing particularly deep or challenging about CADILLAC 
RANCH, but the simple story supports three solid characters and a dose

handsome, wealthy, or attractive, claims to have made love to over
10,000 women.; If sex is this miserable, abstinence may be an
attractive alternative.; Whereas there is a case that can be made for making
something this sexually explicit, this movie fails spectacularly.; Making it especially hard to endure,
ROMANCE's energy level is as low as its depressed heroine's.; Her boyfriend,
Paul (Sagamore Stévenin), who refuses to have sex with her, tells her
frankly that he'd rather be alone reading a book or hanging out with his
male buddies at the local bar."
284106.0,Hard Drive,1999.0,"However, this fantasy
is rather dark and in might not be as harmless in real life
as it is in cyberspace.; Filmske recenzije na hrvatskom/Movie Reviews in Croatian

rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Although
HARD DRIVE at least tries to deal with serious subjects, the
audience is left with the impression of failed effort, and
those subjects seem too lofty for unsuitable for something
so exploitative like erotic thriller.; Unfortunately, despite rather nice
photography by Sead Muhtarevic, HARD DRIVE in the end falls
apart because of cliches and director James Marandino's
inability to prevent confusion among the audience.; Unfortunately, when screenwriter
and lead actor Leo Damian tries to explore the ultimate
consequences of such alienation, HARD DRIVE begins to fall
apart.; That man is Will (played by Leo Damian), wealthy
Californian who never leaves house and spends all time in
front of the computer screen.; Reason for that is his
obsession with on-line communications, namely those of the
sexual nature."
284361.0,Payback,1996.0,"Overall, like Reservoir Dogs, I won't extol it as one of the greatest films
of all time, but, its the best out there.; Helgeland peppers the film with many
noir like touches, and Payback also has a deliberately old fashioned,
'70's look about it.; I 
really enjoyed ""Payback.""; Payback is not a perfect movie, but it is the perfect antidote to the
current political and social climate.; Payback is a
man's movie, chock-full of action and grit and double-crossing and plot
twists and pain and everything that makes a movie enjoyable.","Basically, Gibson's miscast, delivering a dull, portentous narration and desperately looking for wit where none exists.; And Gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act
like a ""bad guy"", and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant.; His character Porter is
nothing more than his Lethal Weapon character Martin Riggs gone bad.; Worse, it's not even entertaining.; And though the film is
obviously designed to have the audience root for him, it is made
evidently clear that he's not the nicest guy to be around."
285340.0,Mother,1987.0,"After
audience tests, it had its music removed -- yet it was one of the best
pictures of 1994, with Brooks's manic performance contributing a great
deal.; What the dickens,
this may be broad humor but it is hilarious.; And
just as Norman's family had its own brand of extreme dysfunctionality,
Albert Brooks dredges up more of his neuroses in MOTHER, a new comedy
about making peace with your past -- particularly with Mom.; Jeff's house,
cleverly (because it is done discreetly) exudes bourgeois values.; And while you may not really understand this Experiment thing, the
give and take between the two leads makes for some excellent comedic
moments:  Mom talks about John's divorce to the pet store clerk, John
takes Mom into Victoria's Secret to buy her some crotchless panties.","And what amouns to an
intrusion on a woman who has lived alone for twenty years does not help
either.; But the script takes her idiosyncrasies too
far.; So, in the first 15 minutes, here's what we do get.; Bothersome too is the fact that Mother just might be a sly cookie but
comes through  as a mix of flutterheadedness and vagueness.; Production
design, Charles Rosen."
287704.0,Redboy 13,1994.0,"Especially considering its humble origins in the backwoods of
Texas, it's a damn good one.; REDBOY 13 pays homage to DR. STRANGELOVE, FULL METAL JACKET, DIRTY
HARRY, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, RAMBO, and, most importantly, the James Bond
films.; Er... a *gosh darn* good one, as Colonel
Calcan (Logan) would say.; Set in the waning days of the Cold War,
REDBOY 13 is the story of a 13-year old boy (Roy-Brown) who is trained
to be a top agent for a splinter group of the U.S. government called the
C.Y.A.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","A darling of the festival circuit, REDBOY
13 is shot in 35mm Cinemascope, has dozens of computer-generated effects
(they look kinda cheesy, but hey, this is an indie pic), and only really
suffers during some hammy acting that wanders into Leslie Nielsen
territory a few times.; In fact, if van Bavel didn't look so frighteningly like shock filmmaker
John Waters, one might be tempted to take REDBOY at face value.; Tempted, but impossible.; There's even a big Bondian opening
credits sequence with silhouettes, grandiose vocalizing, etc.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

287821.0,Catfish in Black Bean Sauce,1998.0,"Nevertheless, Catfish in Black Bean Sauce takes a considerable dive into
its characters heads without telegraphing their every feeling.; There's a
healthy honesty to his story, and he extracts strong emotional
performances out of his leads.; You can find the review with full credits at

siblings are brought up in California by a black couple; sister Mai
marries an Asian, and brother Dwayne's getting engaged to an
African-American woman (Love and Basketball's Sanaa Lathan).; Dolores, Mai's
American mother, immediately resents Thanh with a twist of pride and
jealousy that Mary Alice boldly brings to the movie.; Mai is sure of her
desire to be with her birth mother, but Dwayne discards the idea.","But along the way, there's rat-a-tat
comedy dialogue that's overwritten, some clunky dream sequences, and the
periodic montage that screams B-movie, or even worse, B-movie satire.; The effort is certainly worth noticing -- his
script is an impressive debut, trying to flesh out nine closely-knit
characters -- but some stale and predictable presentation drags down a
strong idea.; Neither the
shots, editing, nor actors' timing was worth the trouble.; This includes a sequence that gathers all the
players in one room, in a stilted attempt at wacky chaos.; After the
possibility of a strong conclusion, the film's final act unfortunately
heads for sitcom country."
288174.0,Hundred Percent,1989.0,"HUNDRED PERCENT is one of those slice-of-life movies,
the kind that usually have names like MYSTIC PIZZA, the film about three
gal waitresses in a pizza parlor in Connecticut, and a two-season slice
of the girls' romance lives.; Getting back to the film, the cinematography in HUNDRED PERCENT is
interesting in that it's filmed wider than most normal films, giving the
Venice Beach setting a quaint, yet larger than life feel.; At
this time HUNDRED PERCENT has not yet been widely released, but it has
opened to enthusiastic responses at a Harvard test screening as well as
here in Chicago.; Two of the
plots have unexpected endings, and the romance has a typical ending, but
Dustin Nguyen sparkles in his role as romantic lead.; Actually HUNDRED PERCENT is three stories in one, an independent film
done up as a PULP FICTION-like collage of interwoven mini-episodes.","Let's face it:
70% of the roles offered to Asian Americans in 1998 are hackneyed
stereotypes.; In Hollywood, Asian American actors get short shrift.; Troy (Garrett Wang) is an aspiring actor who finds that he
doesn't agree with the racist caricatures he is forced to play.; So the odd thing about HUNDRED PERCENT is that it's chock
full of Asian American actors and actresses who go about playing their
roles as if it's entirely normal for them to go about playing their
roles.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

288503.0,Killjoy,1998.0,"It's entertaining ala Columbo style, as the last scene has
all the suspects in the morgue and the cop, Lou Corbin (Robert Culp),
plays a trick on the murderer to get a confession, just like they do it
on TV when they wrap up a case.; The B-film left a warm spot in my heart, as it cured my
insomnia without me using a sleeping pill and having to worry about side
effects.; Corbin meets individually with all the suspects and only discloses
that he's a cop after his investigation is in its final stages.; At the bar, Paul learns that Laury, his lifelong friend and the one his
mother compulsively wants him to marry, has just become engaged to Max.; Dennis Schwartz: ""Ozus' World Movie Reviews"" © ALL RIGHTS RESERVED   DENNIS SCHWARTZ The review above was posted to the

doing the killing.; KILLJOY (TV) (director: John Llewellyn Moxey; screenwriter: Sam Rolfe;

pilot for a possible TV series.; I did guess who it was about half way through on a
hunch, since the plot didn't leave much in clues."
289502.0,Kismet,2001.0,"She is wonderful as Jamilla, the Queen of the Harem,

legs lacquered in gold, costumed in Art Deco gaudiness, and being
referred to as the 'Lady of the Moonlight.'; KISMET (director: William Dieterle; screenwriter: from play by Edward

Davenport (Agha), Florence Bates (Karsha); Runtime: 100; 1944) A very entertaining kitsch film, with great costumes, a fine sense of
adventure, and an ample sprinkling of comedy.; James Craig handsomely plays
this role, where he meets Hafiz in his disguise as a fake prince and
laughs at his obvious deceits, and then he scales a high wall to meet
the woman he falls in love with, not knowing it is the beggar's
daughter, who is kept there by her father to keep the cruel outside
world away from her.; Hafiz has been a beggar all his life in Baghdad, practicing the art of
thievery through his ability to perform magic.; But she falls madly in love with the gardener's son, who unbeknownst to
her is really the caliph, and who makes plans to marry her.","The father promises his daughter that he raised her

enthusiasm overcomes technical deficiencies and an amateurish style 
(JUPITER'S WIFE was shot on video for a budget of about $500).; As a character study, JUPITER'S WIFE is no more or less engrossing

290657.0,Dead End,1996.0,"""Dead End"" is an excellent adaptation of the Broadway play
about the troubled lives of the poor in New York City.; Bogart had a great 
tough guy voice, and again plays a gangster, something he 
did often prior to ""Casablanca.""; Their dialects and
dialogue is very entertaining, especially when they mock
their wealthy neighbors.; The Dead End Kids ended up with
their own movie contract, which lasted for years through
films that declined into the Bowery Boys series.; ""Dead End"" weaves three story lines.","McCrae's character
is not wholly credible, and temporarily changes from
laconic leading man to action hero when the plot demands
punishment for Bogie.; The third storyline is inevitable but not as interesting.; Joel McCrae must choose between two girlfriends, a wealthy

291300.0,Martha & Ethel,1998.0,"The film tells of the
love and the closeness of the two nannies with their charges and how
they influenced the Johnstone's five children and the six Ettingers.; The difference in the two nannies is obvious
but that they both loved the children is equally apparent.; Although this review is written in mid February 1995,
mark MARTHA & ETHEL down as nominees for a Documentary Oscar come
February 1996.; Ethel, the daughter of a black South Carolina share cropper
family  eventually moved north and took on the job of raising the
little Ettinger children.; Jyll was fascinated by
the number of pictures on the walls of Ethel, Barbara's old nanny.","Who, then, would expect a
documentary about a couple of nannies would not only be of interest to
the average moviegoer but would actually turn into a 4-byter?; Jyll Johnstone, the producer-Director, wanted to make a film about
Martha, the nanny who played such an important part in her life and
family for forty years.; Most of us have grown up without the help of a ""nanny.""; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

291541.0,Paradise,1998.0,"Overall, I enjoyed PARADISE very much and can recommend it.; This stands in contrast to the larger-than-life, hand-holding feel of
the typical Hollywood film.; What makes PARADISE more successful is the degree to which it
remains faithful to the French original aided by the surprising
performances turned in by Griffith and Johnson.; The story is simple,
spare, told in small scenes that exist without explanation or comment.; Johnson turns what must be his best
performance as the man who must climb out of self-loathing and
bitterness.","Donoghue in general was so intent
on making a serious relationship film, so intent on eschewing Hollywood
fantasies, that she over-corrected into the realm of good intentions and
some dry stretches.; Her mother's
comic potential becomes in the hands of Donoghue more irritating than
funny and I was left wondering why anyone would put with such a person,
at least until the climactic scene.; (NOTE: this film is rated PG-13 for language and some nudity.); Probably, the only member of the cast member whom I found to be
problematic was Elijah Wood, who played the boy in AVALON and who here
plays the insecure, loner city boy, the scholarship boy at the private
school who no more fits in with the sons of wealth than he does with the
street toughs who chase him in his own neighborhood.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

291548.0,Payback,1990.0,"Surprisingly, the film gels quite nicely.; The film is shot in a grainy blue
colour which adds to the gritty feel of it all in an effective way.; It is
also obvious, though, that almost all of Payback is immensely enjoyable.; Although the film tends to use over the top violence to achieve it's
laughs, this is a enjoyable enough ride.; Finally, William Devane turns in an excellent performance
as Carter, a super slimy crime boss, and James Coburn is fun as a sharp
dressing villain.","Also,
someone decided a voice over would be a good idea, but it turns out to be
the worst voice over since Bladerunner (1982) with annoying muttering by
Gibson over the proceedings.; I wouldn't have a problem with this 
offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest, but 
it wasn't, and therefore, I found myself having an especially laborious 
time investing myself into a wide array of character that have 
absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever.; Mel Gibson's latest action vehicle is PAYBACK (* ½), a terribly violent,
terribly choppy film that's, well, just plain terrible.; It
doesn't work.; Or is it
symbolic of its crude, distasteful content?"
291853.0,Threesome,2000.0,"Boyle's smile and physical emotions were well done and catching.; The character of the woman (Lara Flynn Boyle best seen in
RED ROCK WEST) is well written and well acted.; It is easy to get swept
up in some of the scenes and have vicarious fun along with them.; For Boyle's acting and
energy, I award it * 1/2.; The plot is quite
intriguing.","The other guy played
by Josh Charles was mediocre.; On the other hand, the guy's parts were poorly written, especially
the handsome, dumb jock type character (Stephen Baldwin).; I did not believe either of the male
characters.; Baldwin
needs to take some acting classes rather than relying on getting roles
because of his good looks and his famous brother.; Here we have 2 men and a woman who are assigned to the same
room in a coed dorm, but are unable to get reassigned."

that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime,
but has finally realized that what he's really done is gotten back at his
criminal father.; He has a really emotional scene towards
the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him.; ""Detective Story"" features one of Kirk Douglas's finest performances.; The film is based on a play, and this is quite evident, as most of
the movie takes place in the one-room flat that the detective's work in.","Lee Grant (virtually unrecognizable) plays a meek
Jewish woman arrested for shoplifting.; With a name like ""Detective Story"", one would assume the film would
resemble an episode of ""NYPD Blue"", but it doesn't quite work out that

is himself trained as a lawyer.; In the 
comedy LANSDOWN, a very promising first effort by writer/director Tom 
Zuber and his first-time cast and crew, Hector doesn't think long 
enough.; The three guys, who get the contract from a sleazy intermediary named 
Gustaf (D.W. Warren), are exactly hit men material.; The film would be acceptable for older 
teenagers."
293406.0,Roosters,1998.0,"ROOSTERS deals with the themes of freedom versus captivity, love
versus obsession, and innocence versus reality.; Hector is
resentful, while Angie waits patiently and in open awe that HE is
coming home.; The climax toward
which all of these build is possibly inevitable, and certainly
foreshadowed, yet it is nevertheless the most powerful single moment of
the motion picture.; Each member of the audience must make his or her own
decision about the truth.; ROOSTERS is not
effortless entertainment, but it will reward those willing to absorb
what it has to say, and the manner in which it says it.","Those who do not enjoy interpreting certain film elements,
and thus drawing their own conclusions, would do better to stay away
from ROOSTERS.; Edward James Olmos, a seasoned veteran, has scene after scene stolen
away from him by his much younger co-star.; The author is taking poetic license
to get across her higher meaning, but on more than one occasion, a line
is jarringly inappropriate for the speaker or the circumstances in
which it is spoken.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

293787.0,From Here to Eternity,1999.0,"It is a good film, and it
has strong appeal for both men (war theme) and women
(romance theme).; (1966), 'The Graduate' (1967) and 'Bonnie and Clyde' (1967) are
direct influences of 'From Here to Eternity' and Frank Sinatra probably
gives the film its most memorable performance, to be enjoyed by
generations to come from a man who could entertain tremendously at the
musical level and was also a top notch actor, without a doubt.; It begs for a repeat viewing from those who havn't seen it in
ages, and it needs to be seen by anyone who has never had the pleasure.; Winner of 8 Academy Awards in 1953 including Best
Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Donna Reed), and
Best Supporting Actor (Frank Sinatra), I was somewhat
shocked that Reed won.; Zinneman brings together all the elements of the film brilliantly.","Both love affairs
are so melodramatic and predictable that they hold
back the entire movie.; That
doom could be foreshadowed by the almost always-painful
expression on Clift's face - his character, even when he
looks happy, is constantly bothered with something.; The relationships between
Prewitt and Lorene, and Warden and the Captain's wife
Karen, are both unconvincing due to expedient set ups
by director Fred Zinneman.; In two cases, such coverage produced
classic films, awarded with ""Oscars"", and Bruckheimer is
going to have huge problems matching their quality.; PEARL
HARBOR, newest action spectacle by Jerry Bruckheimer and
Michael Bay, is the latest example, being mercilessly
badmouthed even before the principal photography began."
295154.0,Night of the Living Dead,1968.0,"In
addition to the two official sequels, there have been countless
variations on the same theme, including the Sam Raimi's excellent EVIL
DEAD series and the horror/comedy RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD.; It was even done with THE BLOB, though with considerably
less success (though the Phantom will always count the scene where one
of the hapless townfolk gets sucked down a kitchen drain as one of his
all-time favorites).; While films like
THE FLY and THE THING effectively updated their respective tales,
Romero's remake is sort of like the Ted Turner approach to filmmaking --
take an old classic, muck around with it a little, put it in a shiny new
box, and voila!; Yet Romero and Savini are remarkably restrained throughout NIGHT;
in fact, the Phantom believes that the original may even be a little
gorier.; (There are other ""in"" jokes throughout
the new NIGHT, including a brief cameo by Romero himself, and in fact
the film really does play better for true horror phans than it does for
the casual viewer).","Cooper is stuck
doing and saying patently ridiculous things, and the actor who portrays
him appears to be trying out for a part in a David Mamet play.; And why a remake of the original,
instead of at least attempting a new twist on an old theme?; But together with the generally awful acting, it's
difficult to get through the remake without either laughing or yawning.; He even
attempts a Raimi-esque scene with the zombie's severed hand, and that
scene works in a bizarre, tension-relieving way, but what's the point if
the rest of the film is going to be such a slavish copy of the original?; But perhaps it's time that he and Tom Savini (creature FX and
makeup whiz and the director of the remake) move on."
296799.0,Child's Play,1998.0,"That doll's moving on
its own!; Thanks to convincing special
effects, the movie passes its most important test: the mobile and murderous
doll is believable and quite frightening.; CHILD'S PLAY is fun, campy, not too gory, and at times genuinely
suspenseful.; Chucky's demented gaze and
sinister smile are haunting and will make you think twice the next time you
see a cabbage patch kid.; Although it doesn't come
close to the unrelenting terror of the voodoo doll episode in ""Trilogy of
Terror,"" ""Child's Play"" is still better than most recent horror flicks.","If there's anything really wrong with ""Child's Play,"" it's that it's too
trite and has too less self esteem.; At almost 90 minutes, ""Child's
Play"" features way too less to be a real classic of horror.; Although I enjoyed the humor, suspense, and premise of CHILD'S
PLAY, the film's lack of originality bothered me.; Even seeing
it in the tiny, claustrophobic, and mechanically-challenged theatre at
my college wasn't the horribly dull experience I thought it would be,
not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd (which you almost need to
watch a film like this - and if you don't believe me, try and watch this
flick by yourself one day), but because as a whole, this isn't a bad
movie.; My biggest problem with CHILD'S PLAY is its ending which,
although effective, seems lifted directly from THE TERMINATOR."

flatulent warthog from ""The Lion King.""; But at the end of the day, it's Woods and DeVito who give

self-deprecating humor.; After many battles, the best being the well choreographed

setup by the 5-woman Greek chorus-cum-girl group, the scene shifts to
Olympus, where Zeus is showing off his newborn son.; How about a song about being a hero instead?; It is no wonder that the Disney executives are scratching their
collectives heads over the disappointing performance of their big
animated movie of the summer."
299713.0,Liar Liar,2000.0,"All-in-all, LIAR LIAR is pretty good fun, and it represents one of 
Carrey's most entertaining movies to date.; Though it is not
one of my favorite movies, it is definitely worth seeing.; Last week I saw Howard Stern's PRIVATE PARTS and found it one of
the funniest and sweetest films in a long time.; The story brings out simple
but important issues about life like keeping your promises, loving your
children and of course being honest.; Part of what makes great comedy is stripping a person down to their
core.","It is boring, stupid,
melodramatic and in the end ugly.; It fails to be funny.; It fails
to be suspensful.; When it's not trying to be funny,
it's trying to be melodramatic--but it's just annoying, stupid and sappy.; It fails to be insightful."
300199.0,Impromptu,1986.0,"While there may not quite be a lot of truth, or guarantee that it is all
quite correct, there is a nice touch of the 'muse' which drives many artists
to create what they do, and in this area, the film is excellent.; All the ladies in this film have a
good time as the courtesans they are, and the film plods
along an incredible barrage of gossip and small events, which make it
difficult to follow at times.; This is a
film for both literature, and music lovers, for it treats both quite
importantly.; And as such, it also puts down the mistress system as a bit
corrupt on its own feet, and that even women are adapt at playing this game.; Judy Davis as George Sand is very good, as is Julian Sands as Liszt.","And perhaps much of it is because I like to 'study' historical characters in
the field of the arts, compared to their artistic endeavors.; Someone says to
DELACROIX....paint something 'dead' this time.... you have to know the
romantic artists for this film to make better sense.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

300617.0,Hair,2000.0,"Acting is also very good -
usually underrated Treat Williams gives one of his best
performances and John Savage is also very good, especially
when we compare his character to the somewhat similar role
in THE DEER HUNTER.; That often resulted with original and powerful works, and
HAIR is one of them.; This film also happens
to have rather great sentimental value to the author of this
review; long time ago I received the movie soundtrack as
birthday present and it is one of the most treasured vinyl
records in my collection.; Musical aspect of HAIR is superb.; Forman showed great
fascination with the popular culture of his adopted country
yet his perspective of the outsider often allowed him to
approach American themes and characters from unusual angles.","Basically, the last shot in Arlington is followed by the
scenes of thousands of anti-war protestors in front of the
White House.; HAIR, although very likeable film, has some flaws.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; Forman usually doesn't allow them
to get in the way of the plot and when he does, he makes
some interesting editing experiments."
302945.0,Love Affair,1995.0,"But nice music all the  way through
helps us cope through a rather difficult situation.; As a
travelogue, as a tour de force in camerawork, and as a mood creator, it
is excellent.; Really nice film, with some great touches all the way through.; Tahiti is beautiful.; There are a few things that stand out in this film, the major one being
Miho Nakayama, in the double role, which is excellent, and really well
designed and thought out.","On the other hand, I give it just ** and do
not recommend it to anyone as it just did not work for me.; She's not even tolerable.; And Capshaw has been horribly attired and photographed: in a flat shag
reminiscent of Fonda's in KLUTE, and wearing a god-awful beaded beret,
she's more prostie than celeb.; Bening is SO lovely to look at (OK,
OK, Beatty is not too bad looking either), but the lines she gives were
not convincing enough for me.; One wonders what they find attractive
about each other: in de-aging lighting effects, Beatty looks and acts and
talks like he's suffering from the very earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's
-- though sometimes he appears to be bumming from Steven Weber's Brian on
""Wings"" -- and Bening, with a runway model's thinness and haughty sarcasm,
is this or any season's polar vortex; she'd have no trouble immobilizing
Mr."
305385.0,To Be or Not to Be,1998.0,"Benny was a great comedian with perfect timing,
facial expressions and vocal inflections.; Better than Chaplin's ""The Great
Dictator"", it is surely the best Nazi satire.; It helps
that he is given great lines, particularly during
his interviews with blustering Colonel Ehrhardt
(Sig Rumann).; ""To Be or Not To Be"" is an outstanding comedy
and drama.; Sobinsky, part of a Polish squadron based in England,
suspects Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges) of
being a Nazi spy.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

308165.0,Action Jackson,1995.0,"Wherever she 
left off with Prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career 
advancement she picks up in ACTION JACKSON.; Jackson's response is, ""I think I felt that way once.; After hearing what Jackson thinks of him, Stone says, ""I take 
it you're not one of Dellaplane's friends.""; They called it 
love.""; He responds, ""You're 
getting one,"" and it's damn clever because he's sitting down at the 
time.","This 
leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade, and with the 
dialogue they're given, there's not much room for improvement.; Toward the bottom of the '80s action movie barrel lies 
ACTION JACKSON, the only movie in Hollywood history to show 
Sharon Stone and Vanity topless within a span of ten minutes.; ""Not unless they changed the 
definition,"" Jackson glowers.; It's a testament to the '80s that Sharon Stone is killed off 
within the first 30 minutes but Vanity survives the whole movie.; Prince wouldn't even let out an innuendo that lame and he's the king of the horndogs... or at least the prince."
310585.0,Iris,1997.0,"IRIS is quite a simple story but a 
heart-warming one.; The film is in Italian with English subtitles.; Along the way in this sweet story, she

319065.0,Hardcore,1995.0,"Some of my friends who went to live in USA complain about
one thing - that country is very different from the one
depicted in Hollywood movies.; Anyway, despite some flaws, HARDCORE remains
very interesting and powerful piece of cinema.; Van Dorn is perhaps
flawed, and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth
at the end; but the viewers simply know that his cause is
just, and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her
loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only
want to exploit her body.; In late
1970s, it was totally different situation - films were
expected to have mature, serious themes for the mature
audience.; For Schrader this film was nice opportunity to
expand the subplot of his previous work, TAXI DRIVER - one
that deals with the great generational divide that tormented
the American society in 1970s.","In the first scenes, he is portrayed as nice
family man who actually doesn't deserve to experience
parent's worst nightmare.; On the surface, it may look
that way - audience is forced to sympathise with Van Dorn
and his quest.; Unfortunately, Schrader fails to
erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning, and
his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of America seems
lost in somewhat clichd finale.; The new
America, on the other hand, fares no better - ideals of the
so-called ""sexual revolution"", same as all other
""revolutions"" of the Swinging Sixties, degraded into
exploitation and depravity.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

320709.0,Antonia,2001.0,"Aided by a fine cast giving unaffected performances, Gorris has 
fashioned a rare and wonderful world capable of provoking both laughter 
and tears -- sometimes at the same time.; Well thought out, beautifully written, and worth seeing.; and as the film says in the end,
nothing ""has come to an end"".... except this fine film, with so many
excellent moments.; It is right after the end of World War
II, and the banners of freedom and liberation are flying everywhere in
Holland.; Before she
dies, she reflects in her mind's eye on her long and full life and,
through one long flashback, we see that life and the people whom she
encountered on the way to this fateful final day.","Daniklle does it with him in complete boredom.; The only
exception seems to be mentally retarded men who come off as being
victims along with most of the females.; This is a film that I tried very hard to like but there is just
too much sanctimony here.; As a sex, we learn in this
mean spirited film, that we men are brutish at best.; (Please don't confuse
this with the way men use women as sex objects!"
326205.0,Of Mice and Men,1980.0,"I
definitely recommend this film to everybody.; By most measures this is a very good adaptation of a great book.; Likewise, the wonderful Joe
Morton (BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET) begins as the brutally, cruelly
angry Black man, eventually shows his pain and loneliness.; It is
a wonderful story that is an essay on loneliness and pain.; As George, the smaller, smarter migrant
worker who has fallen reluctantly into the role of Lennie's protector,
Sinese is especially sympathetic and effective.","Any variation from the novel seems out of place, since the novel is
so near to being a script.; There is only minimal description in the novel, enough to set the
scene, and the rest if dialogue.; One violent scene
is just too bloody really to make sense.; These
things might have worked brilliantly on stage, but on the big screen
they serve only to draw attention to the actor, not the character.; But a lot of this
film really is just too pretty for the film's own good."
329996.0,Dumbo,1994.0,"One of my favorite characters in the movie is the train,
which manages to talk as it whistles and chugs along.; The animation of the train beginning its journey is marvelous.; Timothy and the magic feather
are with him, and the mouse urges him to open his ears
to fly.; The stork
is voiced by Sterling Holloway, later of ""Winnie The Pooh""
fame.; The movie is flawless, from
the charming animation, to the vocal characterizations, to its
moral of not judging a person (or an elephant) by its appearance.","Still, the crows are not that offensive.; Mrs. Jumbo and Jr are ostracized and the
baby is jeeringly named Dumbo.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; Dumbo is mercilessly tormented by adolescent kids.; A flock of black crows spots the elephant sleeping the tree."
332606.0,It Happened Here,1998.0,"It is the spirit and the atmosphere of the
piece that seize hold of us, not the limitations of the production budget.; The premise of this most unusual war film is that Britain was invaded and
occupied after the Dunkirk retreat, and in a mixture of documentary and
narrative styles it sets out to tell the story of the occupation that the
country narrowly (some would say, unaccountably) escaped, up to and
including the 'liberation', orchestrated by the efforts of local partisans
with American assistance, in the war's closing year.; It is an intensive study of what
it might have been like in England in 1944 if it had lost the war and
had been occupied by the Germans.; The retreating
British army is driven back to the sea on the beaches of Dunkirk, and makes
good its escape back to England carried by a makeshift fleet of sea-going
pleasurecraft and small boats that previously carried parties of
holidaymakers up and down the Thames or over and back to the Isle of Wight.; She is most proud of the new shoes they give her, which is
probably one of the appeals the Nazis had to the people when starting
out in impoverished Germany.","There could be no more subversive artistic act than an
attack on this smug self-image.; The acting, as one would expect from a group of amateurs, is
uneven.; It was the directors intention that by having
the neo-Nazi leader speak his mind, he would reveal how ridiculous his
ideas were, which proved to be true.; It looks as if it is
a semidocumentary, with scenes padded for dramatic effect and narrative.; This low-budget independent
effort (it had a whopping budget of about $20,000), initiated from an
original idea by Kevin Brownlow.The events are make believe; the B/W
film resembles an Orwellian nightmare."
332983.0,Masala,2000.0,"Highly Recommended.; Lord Krishna is
representative of the older generation and their tenuous grasp on a mindset
that is often incompatible with their immediate surroundings.; He also essays wonderfully the
role of Lord Krishna.; These two different characters with the same name symbolically
represent the two polar components of the Indian immigrant experience.; Non-Indians will enjoy this film, but Indians will be
able to fully appreciate the level to which issues involving the Indian
diaspora are addressed.","He is not given much to do as the character of Lallu's
brother who is underdeveloped, even though he is central to the main plot.; However, that character is probably the most poorly realized
character (Does he need to be constantly brandishing his knife?; In another, a young man fantasizes about a prospective
arranged bride as an rather explicit Kama Sutra style scene.; The reason it
appears to fail in some places is because it aspires to do too much.; However, it is good to see a film choose to set high standards and fail
rather than set low standards and achieve them all."
333754.0,Boys and Girls,1996.0,"It's one of the many subtle surprises in Boys & Girls, and it
keeps the film floating with an infectious energy.; You can find the review with full credits at

with just as much fun and fewer contrivances.; Iscove, a TV veteran and director of Prinze's She's All That, provides
so much screen time between the leads that there are times when
sequences seem almost too long  until we realize we're seeing Ryan and
Jennifer weeks or months later, and not the same night as the previous
scene.; The smart script for Boys and Girls, written by the humbly-credited
`Drews', succeeds in part because Ryan and Jennifer nurture their unique
friendship for nearly all of the film.; Iscove injects the film with the total atmosphere of college life,
Berkeley, and San Francisco, creating a fuller environment for his
characters and story.","It's a shallow little film that's just not funny
enough or perceptive enough to register as anything but weak imitation.; The other actors, like Jason Biggs, Amanda Detmer and Heather Donahue, simply look bored, desperately wishing they were elsewhere.; Both wish they could apply
their positive personality traits to their floundering relationships,
but it just doesn't work.; The opening credits re-make of J. Geils Band's ""Love Stinks"" is merely a
clever diversion; apparently Harry Connick Jr. was unavailable to do the
honors.; Written by Andrew Lowery and Andrew Miller (who call themselves the Drews) and directed by Robert Iscove, as a date movie, it's so blatantly formulaic and generically predictable that it's tedium."
333851.0,Romeo Is Bleeding,1998.0,"It's certainly hardboiled,
which is in keeping with the overall tone, but it's also incredibly
long-winded and intrusive.; Jack played by Gary Oldman (DRACULA, SID
AND NANCY, JFK and many more fine performances) is a dirty cop.; Jack soon realizes he
can't have it both ways, as Falcone and Mona begin closing in from
opposite sides.; ROMEO IS BLEEDING certainly has all the elements:  the cop who
can't keep on the right side of the law, the cocktail waitress
girlfriend, seedy hotel rooms, the long-suffering wife, the high body
count, and the femme fatale.; Even though it takes place in the 90s, the atmosphere is pure
40s.","It's not a boring film, just not a good one.; Gary Oldman's performance is
disappointingly weak; he seems nearly bored.; She whines her way through her lines, and her attempts to
look and act sexy come across as ridiculous.; Poorly developed characters aside, the screenplay also suffers
from several logistical problems.; Not only is
Jack Grimaldi unlikable, but he's boring, and certainly not a match for
the villainess."
334130.0,Open Secret,1994.0,"The climax is action-packed as Strauss is also taken by the group when
he comes looking for Paul, but he leads them into a trap by taking one
of them back to his photo store for the negatives.; He tells them he has to go out an emergency, but he
will leave them the key with his landlord and they are welcome to stay
with him.; They find out from him that there is prejudice against the Jews in the
neighborhood recently, as Strauss tells them there's a group trying to
put him out of business because he's a Jew.; The
landlady (O'Neal) is told her tenant is missing and she keeps Nancy
company while hubby investigates; she also tells them Ed had lost his
job recently.; This is one of
the rare occasions that Leonard played a cop instead of a gangster.","The hate group now goes after the
couple to try and get the pictures back.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

334185.0,Seconds,1996.0,"This was one of Hudson's most ignored roles, and it's a good one: he does a
great job of suggesting a transition between the burned-out Hamilton and the
refurbished Wilson.; Also damn near perfect.; Like any good movie, it tells a strong story, populates it with
believable characters, and gets under our skin.; With a good deal of work, Hamilton is remade into Antiochus Wilson (Rock
Hudson), an artist.; Frankenheimer's ""ultimate nose job"" movie is now back out on laserdisc,
better-looking than ever, and, if anything, even more terrifying and
relevant than ever before.","Maybe also something
even more horribly seductive.; His relationship
with his wife is perfunctory and tired; he doesn't even know his daughter
anymore.; SECONDS was also out of
circulation for a long time, mostly because of its incredibly painful
subject matter.; And brother, does this one
ever get under the skin.; Even the innocent
scenes look disturbing, like the walls are ready to fly apart any second."
334800.0,Johnny Got His Gun,1999.0,"And a very touching movie to boot.; The movie works in flashbacks, starting with the greviously injured Joe and
working our way backwards and forwards through his memory.; One of the most astonishing things about the movie's history came from its
originally being rated X upon release -- not because of a (later excised)
nude scene, but because the MPAA felt that the movie's anti-war theme was
inherently adult.; It sets out to break your heart,
rather than enlist it, and it does that very well.; Joe Bonham (Timothy Bottoms) is a fresh-faced young man who lives in a
Rockwell-esque America that has not yet discovered the horror that is World
War I.","I've always hated ""message"" films -- basically, any movie where it's plain
that the director is trying to preach.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
335691.0,Amnesia,1996.0,"Twenty years later, on the streets of Valparaiso, Ramirez meets 
Zuniga for the first time since they served together.; When Zuniga, 
Ramirez's brutal commanding officer, orders the execution of several 
prisoners of war, the private balks.; While the 
commander is delighted to see a familiar face, Ramirez's first thoughts 
are of vengeance against the man who broke his mind by forcing him to 
engage in atrocities.; Ultimately, this film's perspective is its strength -- it 
looks at a complex issue from a cultural viewpoint unfamiliar to many 
North Americans.; During his 
time fighting under Zuniga, Ramirez manages one small victory by 
allowing a prisoner named Carrasco to escape.","The conclusion, with its all-too-obvious sermonizing, 
lacks punch.; Instead, it ends up as an awkward, unevenly-scripted morality play.; The core story is interesting enough, 
but there are several lengthy tangents and detours that interrupt the 
main plot flow.; Very little of this film is new or original (in fact, a similar story 
was tackled with considerably greater power and finesse in a small 
Romanian film called AN UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER), and its presentation, 
which includes offbeat acting styles and choppy pacing, is distracting.; Can barbarity be 
ignored if it was committed by the victors in the name of winning?"
336664.0,Paulina,1986.0,"The film is in Spanish with English subtitles.; The
passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything
from saint to sinner.; Directed by Vicky Funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the
last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary
footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly
sad and true story of Paulina Cruz Suarez.; I got to learn the film's background when I attended a screening
in which the two women who made it were present.; Quite bloody at times, the story, full of horrific images, seems
designed to shock and repulse us.","The acting is amateurish, the story is maudlin, and it
has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie.; Why else would you include a scene
with a completely nude and bloody 8-year-old Paulina?; It is not rated but would be an R for violence and nudity and would be
acceptable for older teenagers.; Toss out your usual objectivity, ignore how many times you
checked your watch while viewing it, forget how unbearable it was to
sit through, and find some meaningless way to compliment it.; For those without
such context, the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a
bad indie film."
336742.0,Niagara,1993.0,"Peters gives an excellent scream (much more spirited than
Monroe's was).; Some viwers might consider Niagara more of a steamy melodrama than a
noir, but it does have all the dark ingredients fitting a noir film,
whereby an innocent is overtaken by a lust that consumes him, while the
femme fatale is a heartless schemer with a large sexual appetite.; Oddly, she lies to him at first, then finally tells him that Cotten is 
alive and Monroe knows it, not mentioning the murder of Allan.; Yet the normal couple is
attracted to the more exotic one, especially Polly, through whose eyes
the film is filtered out to us.; The Cutlers are nosy, especially Peters, going out of their way to
talk to the Loomis's.","Perhaps 
the whole movie plot has been a slow-moving setup for Peters to be 
in peril.; The last reel plays like
an action film, with a strangulation, a kidnapping, a helicopter rescue,
and one character doomed to be going over the falls.; Now the story becomes increasingly unbelievable.; Rose's diabolical plan is to have her boyfriend kill her distraught
husband and dump his body over the falls to make it look like a suicide.; She's overdressed or
underdressed, depending on how you look at things, as she wears a sultry
red, low-cut dress, which prompts Ray to say, ""Hey, get out the fire
hose."""
337401.0,Mulan,1948.0,"""Perfect.; Despite Disney's trademarked candy-coated Americanization of foreign 
cultures, the film still succeeds, thanks to its sense of style, some 
very nice animation and a simple, but genuinely strong story.; That's a good message and ""Mulan"" is a good movie.; Great family viewing.; The central message in Mulan is a good one for children.","`Aladdin' (1992) was a 
bland effort only really founded on Robin Williams being a funny man; 
`Pocahontas' (1995) seemed more constructed to toe a PC line than 
actually be a film; `The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (1996) failed to be 
the epic it artistically strove to be due to a flat, mawkish story; and 
`Hercules' (1997) took its in-jokey self-referentiality to the point of 
annoyance.; As a villain, the head of the Huns is menacing, evil and 
entirely forgettable.; There is no depth to any of them, save for what the computer coloring can add.; I suppose Disney was afraid of
living Mongols complaining that they're not bloodthirsty barbarians,
and instead picked an extinct tribe to do the evil stuff.; Composed by Matthew Wilder, none of
   the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing, and one --
   ""I'll Make A Man Out Of You"" (unimaginatively accompanying a tired
   montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean
   fighting machines) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems
   almost interminable."
339441.0,Noriega: God's Favorite,,"Bob Hoskins stars as the
cunning and clever, yet desperate and dangerous dictator - and the
resemblance is eerie.; Convinced that he was God's
favorite and blessed with manic energy, Noriega not only survived but
succeeded in acquiring more power than anyone else in his
country.; On Sunday night, April 2nd, at 8 p.m., Showtime premieres a
made-for-television character study of the final years of Panamanian
General Manuel ""Tony"" Noriega's reign.; Certainly Noriega is a
despicable thug, yet he's wickedly intriguing, not unlike other
Central American dictators who consider themselves victims of
U.S. foreign policy.; And the real Noriega is still in
prison outside Miami, serving a 40-year sentence for racketeering,
conspiracy, and cocaine-smuggling.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

339477.0,Chasing the Deer,1985.0,"The climax of the film is the battle of Culloden where father and
son fight unknowingly on opposing sides.; While his father fights with the Jacobite army during their advance to
Edinburgh and on into England, Euan's commander Major Elliot (Brian
Blessed) takes a shine to him as his own dead son would have been of
similar age.; For anyone with an interest in Scottish history and what the 1745
meant for ordinary Scots, this film is essential viewing.; Tam's killing is
witnessed by Euan who manages to shoot one of the Jacobites before
being taken prisoner himself.; There are good performances notably from Fish (former singer with
Marillion) and Jock Ferguson who plays Lord Murray.","For example, the film does not move smoothly from one
scene to the next.; A Jacobite party
appears in the village intent on pressing men into the service of King
James, they are led by Cameron (played by Fish) who bears a bitter
grudge against the innkeeper Tam (Jake D'Arcy).; Young Euan (Lewis Rae) is learning to shoot deer under the
guidance of his father Alistair (Matthew Zajac).; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

339985.0,Strange Days,1999.0,"Bassett is fabulous
as the hardened Mace, and Fiennes is great as the charming but
decaying Lenny.; As he tells his customers, ""This is
not TV; this is real life you will be experiencing.""; Angela Bassett is a wonderful new talent in a great part.; But the
surprisingly good mystery plot of this movie was foremost on my mind.; Still, at a cursory glance, some may dismiss the film, saying,
""This is all familiar territory.""","'Blue Steel' was pathetic with
Jamie Lee Curtis horribly miscast as a tough cop.; Not that ambitious
film-making should be discouraged; just that when it fails to achieve
its goals, it fails badly and obviously.; This movie only gets from weird to worse, with nothing to slow it's
descent into utter ridiculousness.; The real
problem is that STRANGE DAYS tries to be an action film, a martial arts
film, a film about race, and a science fiction film while using a plot
that with minor substitutions would be a cable-bait mystery.; And nothing here comes across as heavy-handed, even
including an all-too-obvious scene invoking the Rodney King beating."
340315.0,Godzilla,1951.0,"If it's not a rush, it's still a ride.; Scenes of the creature racing through the city are great fun, a 
reward for all the phony looking monsters we've endured in past films.; Inspired by the revolutionary special effects of 1993's 'Jurassic Park',
'Godzilla', plain and simple, is a popcorn movie that is beyond the high
brow realm of major criticism and is one of those movie's that despite
the rigid criticism it will receive for its uneven concoction of action
and character fluff, still offers the pleasant and familiar cliches of
an electrifying monster movie.; The story is very simple.; The film is an all out display of
big studio dollars spent during the first of many summer months to draw
a large crowd of movie goers who hopefully will enjoy a film that based
on its well established name, will self by itself.","The characters in this film are at best one-dimensional and at worst boring
and irritating.; The
problem is, I have to review what's on the screen -- a noisy, witless, tame,
lame, underwritten story that bulks overlong and features disturbingly
inconsistent visuals.; Neither hero nor 
villain, Godzilla simply behaves like an animal.; Instead, we're treated to long, boring scenes in which
they exchange cliched dialogue.; Neither is the film Godzilla exciting,
interesting, entertaining or even mildly amusing."
341164.0,Beautiful People,1966.0,"Her aristocratic artistry is an excellent contrast to his crushing
responsibilities.; Beautiful People.; All of Dizdar's
characters vary from the whimsical to the downright bizarre--
which under this director's hand makes ""Beautiful People""
one of the best-realized comedies of the past year.; Two individuals from the same
society have been married with children but are separating
and hostile, while other folks from disparate cultures find
understanding and compassion for one another and become
good friends and lovers despite obstacles put in their paths
by our global order.; His is
the most endearing experience.","Rated R.  Running Time: 107 minutes.; Instead, it sometimes ends up being peachy and drives its
point home like a shot through the heart.; Overseeing those three misanthropes is a
nurse (Linda Bassett).; The Serb and Croat end up in adjacent hospital beds
continuing their spats like two kindergartners while the nurse on duty
appropriately scolds their inappropriate behavior.; An ambitious reporter
flies to Bosnia determined to make sure Brits ""give a shat about what's
going on out there."""
341713.0,Breaking the Waves,1951.0,"If you are prepared for these
images, it is an excellent film which certainly deserves the awards that
it has received.; Emily Watson turns in a beautiful performance, at times genuinely
heartbreaking.; ""I thank you for the greatest gift of all - love.; A brilliant if
somewhat flawed picture.; The incredible performance from the actors
makes the movie brilliant, though a bit too gloomy for my taste.","In comparison, the rest of the film is slow and boring,
with some rather pointed places... like Jan's hospital room, where the
camera does not move as much, or very little, thus suggesting that he is
boring, if one takes that to be a theme.; And then there is the worst aspect of _Breaking the Waves_: the editing.; Even worse than the writing, though, is the cinematography.; This endlessly boring film took almost
165 minutes before, thankfully, it came to an end.; If there's any reason the film fails it's not
because of the premise but because of the slow, boring, uninteresting
storytelling."
343812.0,No Way Out,1999.0,"It
is both intelligent and entertaining, and has the additional advantage of
topicality.; All in
all, one of the best thrillers to come out of the 80s, and certainly one
that still holds up to the test of time.; The elements
are very nicely blended into what has to be one of the finest suspense films of
the decade.; It's a
lot more like a classic Hitchcock film, with the strongly Hitchcockian plot of
a trapped innocent in over his head to go along with it.; It
has a good plot, interesting atmosphere, first-rate acting, well-chosen
cinematography, tense direction, and, best of all, intelligence.","Oh well, it's just a movie!; Unfortunately, Susan appears to have
majored in ""vaginal gymnastics"" at junior college.; The problem here is that writing has failed some very capable actors.; The limo driver would have ended
the movie before the first 60 boring minutes would have ended.; Acting?!?!"
344277.0,Caught,,"Sometimes devastating, periodically erotic, always smartly
written and acted, and frequently tender, CAUGHT is a cornucopia of
emotions.; Masterfully directed by Robert M. Young (DOMINICK AND EUGENE and
TRIUMPH OF THE SPIRIT) and with a well developed screenplay by Edward
Pomerantz (based on his book ""Into It""), CAUGHT is an entrancing film
with sympathetic characters that keeps you glued to the screen.; It is the best part of the film,
and I liked it all except the way the conflict between Nick and Danny
is resolved.; His wife Betty (Maria Conchita Alonso), who answer's the phone as
""Mrs. Joe,"" is proud of her husband.; Soon their small apartment is brimming with sexual tension.","It is rated R
for one dope smoking scene, lots of sex of many varieties, nudity, some
violence, and bad language.; As Joe is cutting fish, his facials pours seem like they will
erupt at any moment.; These people look more like inhabitants of a
documentary than a fictional romance.; Look how shiny the grease reflects off of
Nick's chin at dinner making him look especially crude.; CAUGHT runs 1:59 but doesn't seem near that long."
346364.0,It,1998.0,"""It"" is one of the best preserved silent films
that I have seen.; Yes, but how good is the movie?; Her other
great success for that year was ""It"".; Scandals, both
real and fabricated, helped drive Bow out of
Hollywood.; Producer Adolph
Zukor's attention ensured a big budget with good
sets.","Such problems
are endemic to most 1920s films, but not this one.; ""It"" was loosely based upon Elinor Glyn's pulp
novelette, which defined 'it' essentially as a code
word for overwhelming sex appeal.; There are no dancing lines
or exploding white dots, no orange-yellow tones,
and no obvious missing frames.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; Betty works hard to catch the eye of Waltham,
whose fiancee Jacqueline (Adela Van Norman) is
attractive but boring."
346545.0,Moonstruck,1979.0,"And one more touch adding to the effect: Like THE KILLING
FIELDS, A ROOM WITH A VIEW, FATAL ATTRACTION, and several other recent
films, MOONSTRUCK makes good use of the transcendentally beautiful opera
music of Giacomo Puccini.; Vincent Gardenia, on
the other hand, is a good actor and he too turns in one of his best
performances.; The movie works by combining clockwork plotting with careful and intelligent
pieces of human comedy.; Jewison can charm magical performances from his actors.; One of the best scenes in the movie has Cage's
character unveiling the source of his bitterness: his brother caused him to
accidentally lose a hand in a bread slicer (he now has a wooden
replacement), and now he's submerged himself in bread-baking almost as a
kind of pathological self-penitence.","Then the final months of 1987 saw two good comedies that did not
taste of bubble gum.; Maybe.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

349066.0,Rush Hour,2000.0,"A fun and enjoyable piece of escapism that serves both stars well.; This is contrasted with the more
   subtle, drier humor of Chan, and it makes for a brilliant combination.; His snappy wit is a bit risque at times but
   keeps the movie rolling nicely along.; ""Rush Hour"" is a lot of fun, thanks to flashy 
action scenes, sharp one-liners and the chemistry between Chan and 
motormouth comedian Chris Tucker.; Strong.","That was the
problem that plagued these clones, not to mention the actual sequel:
Another 48 Hours, a complete waste of film.; Not to say the fight scenes are all that bad, it just
seems repetitive after a while.; As a comedy it fails to deliver enough laughs and as an action film
it is nothing but karate rehash.; There's just not much of anything of any value to `Rush Hour.'; His bug-eyed, fast-talking shtick is supposed to be hip, but
it's nothing but juvenile blathering."
349220.0,Hallelujah,1984.0,"The soundtrack for ""Hallelujah"" is excellent.; But at least we have
""Hallelujah"", which is more dynamic, fascinating
and unique than most of the other musicals from
the early sound era.; The nightclub scenes have vintage jazz performances.; Daniel Haynes stars as Zeke, who, along with his
large family, makes a marginal living as a cotton
picker.; ""Hallelujah"" was the first film from a major studio
with an all-black cast.","That, along with cultural reasons and amateur actors,
may account for the exaggerated performances.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; Distribution of the film proved more problematic,
as some theatre owners had fears that 'too many'
blacks would see the film, alienating white audiences."
355246.0,Witness,1999.0,"That's when Haas sees a picture of one 
of the force's most respected officers (Danny Glover) and 
recognizes him as the killer.; Amish Kelly doesn't compromise herself with Ford 
beyond the realm of hungry French kisses, even if she does appear 
topless in a shower scene.; More 
importantly, he exposes young Lukas to a world of sin and 
corruption which McGillis and her bearded counterparts have been 
trying to shelter him from.; These are people who have rejected the American government 
as well as every technological advancement of the last couple 
centuries in favor of those oppressive suits, beards and brimmed 
hats -- bonnets for the ladies.; So Ford has to find a place to hide himself and his Amish 
witnesses.","Seeing her make out with Tom Cruise was 
bad enough.; That's where I really wouldn't have 
minded the Puritan approach; McGillis looks just like my high 
school Bible teacher.; This ends up being a lot funnier 
than a sitcom approach, because nothing is more laughable than 
life itself.; They bring out every Amish stereotype in the book, 
even a barn-raising.; Since, beneath its Amish exterior, this is a typical 80's 
action movie, millions of dollars in drugs are involved and the 
police corruption runs pretty much throughout the department."
355407.0,Blue Moon,1994.0,"It's a gem!; It's a triumph of intelligent acting and film-making with the most poignant scenes set around the dinner table.; Ben Gazzara delivers an emotionally rich performance marked by unflinching honesty, as does Rita Moreno, as th!; On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, ""Blue Moon"" is a sensitive, sentimental 7.; The opening sequence at the christening of their first grandson sets the stage for an examination of the 40 year-marriage of Frank (Ben Gazzara) and Maggie (Rita Moreno).","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
356993.0,Mother,2000.0,"It makes for a simple yet effective plot.; The story explores the subtle and sometimes not-so subtle ways that the
mother and son treat each other as symbols and archetypes rather than as
people.; What John discovers is unexpected by both him and Beatrice.; Also his comedies often take a little longer to
settle in.; She still doesn't get it, and it is
absolutely hilarious.","The joke takes too much
screen time for way too little payoff.; He makes an attempt at dating, but
fails miserably.; For
example, upon John's arrival to his mother's home, his mother starts by
offering him incredibly old and freezer-burned meats, cheeses, and dessert
for something to eat.; The only things that hold this movie back from being better are a
couple of plot holes.; I can't recommend seeing ""Mother"" at the theater, unless you take your
mother!"
357299.0,Cabaret,1985.0,"Taking place in the early 1930s, Bob Fosse's masterpiece, a portrait of life in
decadent Berlin, is both uplifting and grim.; Not your typical musical, it is
comedic and dramatic, realistic, very tasteful, and ultimately thought
provoking.; But the focus never strays from the words in the songs, which is
fortunate, and there are times when showing us what is happening isn't
necessary, because many of the events in ""Cabaret"" were scripted by history,
and there is a strong sense of the bleak future of Germany and the party
lifestyle in general.; Director Bob Fosse masterfully staged the dance and musical numbers,
and he won the Academy Award for Best Director, beating out Francis Ford
Coppola, who's epic ""The Godfather"" in turn beat out ""Cabaret"" as the Best Film
of 1972.; York is nicely understated as Brian, and the other supporting performers,
Griem, Wepper, and Berenson, are convincing in their roles.","But an elderly man sits there knowingly, and looks disgusted.; No.; 1972, 124 min., Rated PG.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; Directed by Bob Fosse."
360392.0,Saving Grace,1997.0,"He nicely captures a portrait of a
man trapped between his undisciplined younger years and the undesirably
mounting obligations of later life.; Like ""The Full Monty"" and ""Waking Ned Devine,"" it's about ordinary people who find they must compromise their values in extraordinary circumstances.; Like ""The Full Monty"" and ""Waking
Ned Devine,"" it's about ordinary people who find they must compromise
their values in extraordinary circumstances.; Reluctantly at first, Grace nurses the plants back to health
-- better than ever, in fact.; If you loved ""The Full Monty"" and ""Waking Ned Devine,"" this is the gentle summer comedy for you!","The worst thing about Saving Grace is that the drug aspect isn't used
with any flair, further highlighting the film's bland, uncreative core.; Saving Grace is so bent on
thinking that just getting high is a hoot, that Blethyn's and Ferguson's
scheme comes across as an opportunity to only showcase this stupid
behavior.; The result is a tiresome, predictable adventure that only becomes more
silly as it goes along.; If it were not for the quirkiness added by the
marijuana aspect, the film would have been devoid of substance.; That's not good."
360606.0,Adventures in Babysitting,1998.0,"And yet despite these considerations, ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING is
irresistibly entertaining, thanks to its charming cast and keen sense of
humor.; ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING is mindless, formulaic, unsophisticated, and
disposable ... and I thoroughly enjoyed it.; What follows is a lot of fun and adventures nowhere nearly as
puerile as the regrettable title might indicate.; ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING has another thing going for it: a wonderful
sense of humor.; As we
perceive society getting weirder, we see more films of people doing normal
things that wind them up in the middle of real chaos, particularly over a
single night.","Regrettably,  the movie fails to make a lasting impression.; Another problem is director Chris
Columbus, writer of GREMLINS and GOONIES.; The fantasy is amusing but sometimes so
exaggerated that first-time director Chris Columbus undermines his own
attempts to generate any real dramatic credibility; a case in point is the
scene in which the little girl gets stranded on a window ledge 40 stories
high.; In any case, ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING
does succeed in fulfilling its primary function, which is to provide
diverting, humorous, and (alas) forgettable summer entertainment.; By the end of the movie, they are supposed to
be wiser and more mature than they were at the beginning."
362038.0,Safe Passage,1999.0,"A great performance.; When SAFE PASSAGE works, it does so because it dares to be more
honest than most similarly-themed dramas.; Susan Sarandon, as Mag, turns in another of her many wonderful
screen portrayals.; She has the guts to take Mag just to the
edge of being crazy, showing us how easy it is to become crazy
raising seven sons and living with an immature husband.; And, again, Susan Sarandon, (much as in
LORENZO'S OIL) is a mother fighting.","With this lack of focus comes the sense that no one making this
movie really knew what it was supposed to be about.; Sam Shepard
spends most of his time moping around; he does nothing to suggest his
role in this family was anything more than perfunctory.; When it fails, however,
which it does nearly as often, it's because the story falls back on
cliches and formulas.; Robert Sean Leonard, a fine
young actor, seems frozen by the constraints of his role.; Susan Sarandon is a big name
who turns in a great performance in SAFE PASSAGE, but even she can't
save this mess."

Movie Fiends: Check out Amazon.com's Top 100 Hot DVDs!; Given a weirdly futuristic spin, Jonathan Parker's interpretation of
Bartleby takes him out of a law office and into a public records
commission, subtly morphing from typist to file clerk.; The
story of Bartleby himself, I fear, is one that will soon be forgotten.; And yet the man
still won't leave!; Screened at the movie's world premiere at the 2001 SXSW film festival.","Much
of Bartleby is lacking in the appropriate context, with random oddities
(notably vignettes featuring Piscopo and Chaykin) peppering the
production (for obvious padding time) but never going anywhere.; Despite
its 83 minute running time, the film quickly becomes tedious, Bartleby's
mantra degenerating into a monotonous whine instead of the working-class
battle cry it ought to be.; Bartleby, the only applicant who
responds to David Paymer's help wanted ad, begins his filing job with
diligence, but soon inexplicably turns into an unmotivated drone,
staring at the a/c vent and responding to requests that he do the tasks
he was hired to do only with the phrase: ""I would prefer not to.""; ), to the point
where Paymer's character is forced to fire Bartleby.; Unfortunately, the bulk of innovation within Bartleby is found within
Glover's casting, and it doesn't spill over to the rest of the movie."
368583.0,Fathers' Day,1993.0,Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.,"Idiotic.; Most stupefying is the premise itself:  we are to
believe that a happily married woman (Natassia Kinski) has no other re-
course than to contact her decades-since-seen lovers?; For-
get the missing jokes, or the glaring lack of sympathetic characters, or
the wasted talents of two talented comedians, or the throwaway role for 
Julia Louis-Dreyfus.; FATHER'S DAY is an unfunny, unmoving sentimental comedy, about two
middle-aged men (Robin Williams and Billy Crystal) who team up to find a
17-year-old runaway who may or may not be one or the other's son.; I mean, her
husband is already on the case."
368666.0,Notorious,2000.0,"It is one of the best examples
of Hitchcock making a simple story into a gem.; Sure, it's not
""Psycho,"" ""Strangers on a Train,"" or ""North by Northwest,"" but it's
still one of the director's best because it shows how truly great he was
by showcasing him in unambiguous mode.; And, of
course, the two are both brilliant in their roles.; What results is a fascinating and creepy film, resulting in one
of the best endings to a Hitchcock film ever.; It was a powerful
scene, with a marvelous crane-shot following them down the stairs and sweeping
the entire hallway as it caught the tension on all the Nazis and the reunited
lovers.","Common sense
would have Bergman draw up a floor plan for Grant prior
to the party, and Grant would bring a date to watch the
cellar door while Grant checks it out.; It is filled with
""vintage sand"" that is later found to be uranium ore.

369778.0,Chocolat,2001.0,"Cinematographer 
Roger Pratt brings an atmospheric, fairy tale look to the film, and Rachel 
Portman's masterful score is her best and most memorable since The Cider 
House Rules.; Binoche was good as
well, with enough range to make her character real and believable, and
Carrie Anne-Moss, great move by you and your agent!; I enjoyed this movie for the most part.; A strong B+.; Juliette Binoche is charming and honest as Vianne, genuinely capturing her 
character's determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more 
happy, independent human beings, but most of Chocolat's success is 
unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting 
actresses.","Working from Joanne Harris's novel, screenwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs 
creates a script that is little more than a sketch, a problem that he 
had in his last effort, Disney's poorly plotted DINOSAUR.; Unfortunately, the movie just didn't seem to know where to stop.; Chocolat keeps veering between fulfillment and disappointment.; Something could have been lost in the
adaptation from Harris' story, as Chocolat's screenwriter's (Robert
Nelson Jacobs) only two other credits are the less-than-stellar Dinosaur
and Out to Sea.; It's an indication 
of Hallstrom's lack of mastery of this material."
371409.0,Enemy of the State,,"""Enemy of the
State,"" like any other Jerry Bruckheimer popcorn film, highly entertains.; This is what
Bruckheimer does best, ain't it?; I loved Gene Hackman as the
gruff, seasoned expert Brill (see Sean Connery in ""The Rock"") and Will
Smith as the reluctant hero Robert Dean (erm, see Nicholas Cage in ""The
Rock"").; This one even more so because it capitalizes on the recent rise of paranoia
as seen on television's ""The X-Files,"" silver screen's ""Conspiracy Theory""
(note the plot similarities), ""The Net,"" and ""Most Wanted"" (starring,
coincidentally, Jon Voight as the baddie).; While the transition of Brill from antagonistic
and unsympathetic to reluctantly friendly paralleled Connery's character a
bit too much for my liking, I ended up rooting for the old man anyways.","Dialogue rehash:
""You're either incredibly smart or incredibly stupid.""; That seemed dumb, but I assume the extra
dialogue was inserted to give the movie an extra anxiety-factor.; Jon
Voight was convincing, way too convincing as the villain.; She seemed too artificial, too forced.; Plotwise, the movie was actually okay."
372922.0,Intimate Relations,1973.0,"When a girl at the laundry where she
works gets the sack for becoming pregnant, Marjorie lectures her
sternly.; Everyone has
their weakness, and reality-based movies are mine.; Julie Walters gives a convincing portrayal of a woman who
fancies herself a young seductress as well as an upstanding member of
the community but is neither.; His wife Marjorie, an unattractive grandmother in
her late fifties, is played by Julie Walters, the Academy Award nominee
for EDUCATING RITA.; ""I like being told what to do,"" he explains.","In the press kit
for INTIMATE RELATIONS, first-time writer and director Philip Goodhew
claims that ninety-nine percent of the facts are accurate.; Eventually, after
more twists and turns, the film comes to its somewhat predictable
conclusion.; He even
took the film's title from the coy term the newspapers of the time used
instead of the forbidden word, ""sex.""; INTIMATE RELATIONS runs 1:45.; When Harold has had enough
of this manipulation by both of them, he joins the army and signs up
for a 12 year hitch."
376178.0,River Red,1995.0,"He traces the
consequences on both of an irrevocable action that solves
one of their problems but leads to more complications in their
lives than the gesture was worth.; When Dave
stabs his father to death Greek-tragic style, alleging that he
did so for his brother's benefit, Tom, who is still a minor,
voluntarily takes the rap and is sent to a juvenile facility.; Moving his characters to their
teens, Drilling shows Dave (Tom Everett Scott) and Tom
(David Moscow) trying to start an old pick-up truck that
they've bought, while disapproving dad (Denis O'Hare) knocks
Tom to the ground and punches out a headlight.; Drilling has a talent for portraying the atmosphere of a
remote area of Americana which offers a bar as the sole
place of entertainment and escape for the locals.; Nonetheless, fine
acting, particularly by David Moscow in the role of the
sacrificing younger brother, engages our care for the two lost
souls as we deplore their malevolent deeds but rejoice in the
justifiable revenge which concludes the story.","Rather, it causes little more than a growing
resentment, even hate, toward the person who has made one
feel culpable.; Ten-year-old Dave Holden
and his kid brother Tom grimace as their chain-smoking father
takes over their backyard touch football, brutally tackling Tom
to Dave's impotent disgust.; Writer-director Drilling opens his story with a flashback to a
remote, New Hampshire setting.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; According to the writer, a man who feels guilty about his
brother's sacrifice does not endear the remorseful person to
his benefactor."
376986.0,Fallen,1996.0,"As the film progresses, it is revealed that the force that Hobbes must now
confront is much larger than expected, and this is where Fallen becomes
deeper and more intriguing than most fright shows.; The performances, for
one, are all great.; Fallen works very well as a film that smashes two very different genres
together.; The score is filled with high strings and is somewhat hard to
describe, but it does work really well.; It does well with the
mixing of the genres and plays somewhat like a longer episode of The
known -- Primal Fear, does an excellent job of bringing the audience into
the film without a sudden onslaught of supernaturalism.","The main problem with this movie is Washington's character, who
is written to be dull and plodding.; We do, however, get lots of footage of a dreary Philadelphia and an 
annoying voice-over from Denzel Washington that drips with clichés.; One or two of
those might have been acceptable...but when the film is filled with
them, you're left to wonder, what's the point?; Writer Nicholas Kazan ('Reversal of Fortune'), has penned a shallow and
unimaginative film of wannabe gothic proportions and instead of coming
up with a story that should have characters we care about, it fails
because it doesn't showcase an acceptable form of depth and therefore
contains a story we ultimately care nothing about.; The premise of the occult tale was too silly to
take seriously."
377430.0,Fearless,1997.0,"What makes unsafe Bridges a
revelation--and how good Weir is as director--is that while we can feel
the fears of the passengers and the haunted doubts and troubles of the
survivors, we're able to feel Max's sudden freedom from mortality as
our own anxieties are ever-increasing.; But it could still be recommended as one of those rare
Hollywood examples of thought-provoking cinema.; The plane crash scene
is incredible, perfectly believable; it looks just like all those
pictures we've seen on the news.; Watching her here, or in one of my favorite movies
COUSINS, we're aware of a spiritual linkage between her and her
mother:we could swear that Ingrid is with us again, her presence so
strong and supportive.; But I'm fully prepared to defend Jeff
Bridges' performance as the most unfairly neglected in the 1993 awards
from critics' associations.","And an early scene where Bridges encounters an old
lover seems pointless.; Unfortunately, as directed by Martin Bell and
written by Peter Silverman, AMERICAN HEART is overly depressing and,
sadly, boring: it's like a Bukowski story told from a
fifteen-year-old's point of view.; (Hiring her for any
movie is like breaking the unspoken law about having babies and kids in
soap operas: that is, no Allen, no babies and only kids who are bad
seeds.); I found the script a little weak.; There is this obvious ploy
concerning strawberries that is just a little too obvious."
377538.0,Joy Ride,1996.0,"But Ride is a surprisingly good little flick.; JOY RIDE is funny, frightening and fabulously fun.; It's also aided by many
noirish images and small touches among the supporting characters that give the
film a quirky humor, as it scales familiar genre territory from remote gas
stations to dead-end dusty roads to hostile redneck bars.; ""It's my favorite.""; It's an
easy film to critique for what it doesn't do, but what it does do very well is
take you for a comically dark fantasy ride and the filmmaker keeps this thriller
tense throughout.","Rated R.  Running time: 98 minutes.; How he
does--just doesn't seem to matter, as the film plays out its hand as a
sophomoric joke gone dangerously bad.; Apparently when the driver, whose physical
charm can be only imagined by the audience in the theaters
seats, discovers that this fictitious Candy Cane is a big, grouchy
guy, he decides he doesn't like being played around with and
resorts extreme measures.; Working from Clay Tarver
and J.J. Abrams clever if less-than-credible script, he utilizes them and more,
throwing in a chase through a dark Nebraska cornfield that evokes Hitchcock's
""North by Northwest"" and Spielberg's ""Duel"" about a faceless trucker who
terrorizes a driver.; Someone said that it reminded them too much of the
killer's phone voice from ""Scream."""
378613.0,Breakdown,1998.0,"Breakdown is that rarity: a fast, efficient, nuts-and bolts thriller that
is both fun and believable at the same time.; One of the most genuinely exciting films I've seen in a
long time.; Kudos also go to first time helmer Jonanthan Mostow, who displays
surprising confidence in his debut.; Breakdown is a wonderful mix of style and heart that will keep you on
the edge of your seat from start to finish.; What makes his character even
better is that he is very realistic.","His pedestrian direction and unoriginal script diffuse
any tension that BREAKDOWN might have generated.; When a film with a familiar
premise appears, you're likely to see dismissive reviews which perpetuate
the notion that the real culprit is lack of originality, rather than lack
of craft.; BREAKDOWN never does that, and, as a result, its increasingly-
preposterous turns come across as laughable.; First-time directors often make the
mistake of blatantly copying their idol or having no style at all.; Kurt Russell has had better acting parts, but this one fell short of
expectations."
380991.0,Faust,1999.0,"Although Svankmajer never claims
that this is an explicit allegory of life in pre-Vaclav Havel Prague,
it's highly unlikely that he was unaware of the comparisons.; It's
Svankmajer's longest, most inventive and quite possibly weirdest film
to date.; And these are frequently stunning--a pool
of nameless slime forms itself into a rapidly-aging baby, hordes of
tiny angels and devils do battle for Faust's soul, apples wither into
maggot-ridden husks at the devil's passing, while an old tramp carries
a badly-wrapped package that might just contain a severed leg--and
Svankmajer throws in plenty of knockabout comedy to emphasise the
story's theatrical origins: a fiery chariot from Hell causes problems
for the theatre's fire safety officer, a devil is repeatedly summoned
and banished by Faust's Punch-like servant until he collapses with
exhaustion (running to and from the theatre past
surprised-looking--genuinely unprepared?--Prague passers-by), while a
Gounod-scored opera/ballet interlude with ballerinas raking fields
beautifully parodies the socialist realism that the old Czech
government was so fond of.; The unexplained shifts in style perfectly suit Svankmajer's
approach to the text, which only vaguely touches on the subtleties and
depths of the Marlowe and Goethe versions--but this isn't an attempt to
provide an alternative to Goethe, it's more of a late twentieth century
response to the theme.; And this
whole theme of Manipulation From Above (or indeed Below) reaches its
climax in the final scene, a gloriously sick plot twist that both makes
perfect sense in context and provides an impeccably neat circular
finale to the film.","There are, however, some funny moments and
     a lot of moments that just make no sense at all.; Much of this film is irritating and
     off-putting.; For no obvious
reason our Faust copies a formula from the book and shoves it in the
clay baby's mouth.; What does
all this have to do with telling the Faust story?; This needlessly obscure version of the classic Faust
gets a high 0 on the -4 to +4 scale."
382755.0,Vampires,1991.0,"The
recently released 'Psycho' is the same way, it's not as good as you'd hope but
it is fun and entertaining.; This movie delivers it all in spades.; John Carpenter does a great job of
directing this film.; James Woods
gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie.; I believe it is an appealing,
refreshing mix (as far as I know, only Near Dark has more or less the
same atmosphere) and I think the movie will benefit from strong
word-of-mouth.","The bad: No scares.; 'Vampires' definately could have been done better.; I believe Carpenter wanted to save it with quick
editing.; Or
an underdeveloped script?""; You'll see... Perhaps you are thinking: ""Okay, but what about cardboard characters?"
384580.0,Superstar,1994.0,"It's a great acted, funny, warm
and engaging film that works on many levels that appealed to me and may to you.; It's a great acted, funny, warm
and engaging film that works on many levels that appealed to me and may to you.; It's a clever movie

the incredible hunk Sky Corrigan (Will Ferrell), who holds the key to
Mary's lifelong dream: a great kiss.","Besides that, Superstar is dull, boring and just not funny.; are so idiotic and
pointless that it's embarrassing to sit through even the skimpy 80
minutes of their nauseating running time.; Undoubtedly, he
has the worst performance in the film.; Superstar is redundant, repetitive and not particularly amusing, with

stupid."
384756.0,Rabid,1997.0,"As the rabies spreads to the general population, a random
attack in a crowded subway car occurs and my favorite one, an attack in
a mall, where Santa gets shot in the fracas, as the police go after the
biter.; It was quite enjoyable in a less
than biting way.; Rose will be
the source of a plague that sweeps across Montreal and forces that city
to be under martial law.; Dennis Schwartz: ""Ozus' World Movie Reviews"" © ALL RIGHTS RESERVED   DENNIS SCHWARTZ The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; He has some fun with this
theme, taking on the subject matter with mock seriousness, showing a
series of attacks caused by Marilyn.","Since there is no cure for this rabies, the police are ordered to shoot
the bite victims and their bodies are carted away in garbage trucks.; There is also an incident in the porno theater, which could have
been funnier.; With this new
organism, she has the urge to bite her victim and draw blood from them
to get nourishment and she thereby infects them with an incurable type
of unknown rabies, whereby the victim forgets what happened and becomes
like a zombie and goes mad, ready to bite the next victim.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

385869.0,Operation Crossbow,1985.0,"Still, ""Operation Crossbow"" is an under-rated, if
minor, spy drama.; I certainly prefer it to
""Torn Curtain"", the Hitchcock spy drama from the
following year.; The Nazis are developing winged bombs and rockets
with which they are devastating London.; There is much tension and suspense in the story.; She plays the wife of the man
Peppard is impersonating.","The special effects are
generally good, although the firestorm at the
end appears to have been superimposed onto the
frames.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

that British cleverness will triumph over German
villainy, but the Nazis have the upper hand
for much of the film."
388428.0,Ransom,1999.0,"This is a great film.; In
this ensemble cast, Sinise and Gibson stand out as the best of the
best.; Delroy rocks, as he always has and will.; Lindo
gives a compelling performance.; It's far from his best film, but he nicely shows us the psychological 
collapse of a flawed entrepeneur.","It is always a disappointment when the filmmakers have a good thing
going then botch things up through carelessness.; Overall, I was disappointed with this film.; Is this bad?; The audience is
then left waiting for Shaker's explanation as to why he would risk an
otherwise successful police career over such a high-profile stunt.; It's like Ron Howard had
nothing better to do, and made this to make some quick money."
388468.0,Grand Hotel,2001.0,"Lionel Barrymore gives the best performance as the
mousey bookkeeper, finally able to tell off his boss
and assume a gregarious, benevolent disposition.; John Barrymore coasts through his role, as the outwardly
placid and pleasant aristocrat who is in fact desperate
for funds as his life has been threatened by mobsters.; The film won
the Academy Award for Best Picture, and has been
considered a classic ever since.; His character is the most sympathetic, more so than
his brother's, since his troubles are not of his
own making.; Except for Greta
Garbo's camping, the performances are good,
especially by Lionel Barrymore and Wallace Beery.","At no
point is his character sympathetic, even early in the
film when he professes to be a family man and an ethical
businessman.; He also manages to smoke about a pack of cigarettes
during the movie.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

389639.0,Bad Girls,1989.0,"She is saved from the hangman's noose by
Anita (Masterson), Eileen (Andie MacDowell) and Lily (Drew Barrymore),

Kid Jarrett (James Russo), a notorious bandit who has a history with
Cody.; Such is the
way in Hollywood these days.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","BAD GIRLS is
lazy, stupid, sloppy and, worst of all, boring.; Screenwriters Ken Friedman and Yolande Finch couldn't be bothered with
such niceties as explaining why Eileen and Lily might want to save Cody
(at least Anita was the one Cody saved).; The cinematography is quite good, but a
big pile of garbage is a big pile of garbage no matter what kind of
filter you put over the lens.; BAD GIRLS is frequently so incoherent that I was forced to wonder
whether director had chopped all the raw footage into two minute
chunks, strewn them about on the editing room floor and pieced the film
together in whatever order he happened to pick them up.; Sometimes you can look at a film as bad as BAD GIRLS and see the
germ of an interesting idea that was undeveloped or simply butchered,
but not here."
390584.0,King Cobra,1997.0,"The film is full of all of these fun cliches, and it's fun to see where it
turns.; A Review by Frankie Paiva

still want to make sweet, passionate love in the forest.""; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","The film does have some suprising twists though, Pat Morita (obviously
doing this film for the work) turns up late in the picture as a snake expert
that has to inject hinself with snake venom monthly to make his blood an
anti-venom and poor Erik Estrada makes an extremely bad and embarrassing cameo
as the town's homosexual Richard Simmons type fitness guru.; There is something about watching (and renting) a movie that
you know is going to be bad to begin with and then watching it for the pure
pleasure of laughing at the bad acting, the poorly written script, and the
inane plot sequences.; During a freak laboratory explosion (cliche #1) a extremely dangerous species
of snake (cliche #2) escapes to a peaceful small town (cliche #3.); So it's up to the
town's good looking doctor (cliche #7) to save everyone from the snake.; Breeding
with one of the snakes there, (cliche #4) as it begins to reek a new kind of
terror (cliche #5) and bite everyone in sight (cliche #6.)"
392044.0,Murder on the Orient Express,1989.0,"The high-point of the film, and of Finney's portrayal,
is when Poirot announces his solution to the murder.; Master Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney, in the best incarnation
of the character ever) is faced with the daunting task of discovering who is
the murderer(s).; Shot with an all-star cast, including Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Sir John
Geilgud, and Lauren Bacall, among others, this film makes for a very
entertaining time.; He imbibes Poirot with a
fastidious, lively approach.; Just sit back, relax, and enjoy ""Murder on the Orient
Express.""","Only Anthony Perkins is a sore
point--his character recalls too much of the personable side of Norman Bates
to be effective here.; Movies just are not made like this anymore.; This is true with her books; however, in
many cases, film adaptions of her books have, in a word, sucked.; Rated PG.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
392676.0,Down to Earth,1997.0,"It's 
funny, but also at the same time has a sweet side to it, and in the end 
delivers a good message.; Mark Addy 
of ""The Full Monty"" fame, does a great job playing his personal servant 
comedically named Cisco.; Wanda Skyes plays Wanda, the loud mouthed but inside 
sweet maid is very funny.; His work in Nurse Betty
and Dogma attest to that.; And, Rock (as Wellingtion) stirs up the 
waters as well as the intensity level of the film in a strong hospital 
board meeting scene.","Young, black, slender and poor Lance ends up in the body of Charles 
Wellington, a pudgy, white billionaire who is supposed to be 53 but 
looks a decade older.; Unfortunately, it's not a good showcase for his talents, since supporting actors like Fred die Faison, Mark Addy and Wanda Sykes fare far better than he does with the material.; But the film spends too much time making Rock, whose
acting seems amateurish, into a romantic leading man.; Which leads me to wonder exactly when does a remake become a rip-off?; How about we make him a
    mediocre comic...hey, I know, make him a mediocre _Black_ comic!"
396105.0,Only You,1950.0,"Marisa Tomei and
Robert Downey Jr. end up together (and please, no one try to tell me
that I'm spoiling anything by revealing that fact) because that's the
way it has to end.; Then she does
meet a man (Robert Downey Jr.) who sweeps her off her feet and
re-introduces her to romance--only his name may or may not actually
be Damon Bradley.; Ingredients: one lost shoe found by a handsome suitor, a gypsy
selling roses, a street corner saxophone player, a carriage ride,
beautiful Italian scenery (including canal boats in Venice), the moon,
the stars, and a version of the title song by Louie Armstrong.; Her
tentative romance with a smooth-talking Italian (Joaquim de Almeida of
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER) is the one thing in ONLY YOU which rings
true, and watching her struggle with her feelings about her marriage is
genuinely affecting.; Both usually appear very natural on screen, and
Downey in particular shows the potential to be a solid, charming
romantic leading man.","In ONLY YOU, however, his lovable rascal is
completely one-dimensional, and the script's attempts to justify his
behavior don't sell.; Oh, and
a reference to ROMAN HOLIDAY.; They are no longer about romances which
blossom between real people in the course of actual interaction;
instead, they are the worst kind of pop fairy tales, selling
infatuation with a romanticized ideal as true love.; And a nice-but-uninspiring guy for the
heroine to throw over.; ""Why?"
396365.0,In the Line of Duty: Manhunt in the Dakotas,1999.0,"Sometimes, like many American TV
movies, it creates drama where drama shouldn't be.; On the
other hand, film is steadily directed by Dick Lowry, and Rod
Steiger does good job potraying Gordon Kahl.; When the U.S. marshals
come to arrest him, it turns out that Kahl isn't alone.; IN THE LINE OF DUTY is the critically praised series of
television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that
claimed lives of law enforcement officers in USA.; That
brings FBI on the scene, and Agent Mayberly (Michael Gross)
is supervising the manhunt.","Unfortunately, THE TWILIGHT MURDERS is
still routine and formulaic television film, that uses
sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of
originality in the script.; On the other
hand, Michael Gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his
interaction with some of the actors is terrible.; However,
film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and
political issues, so hour and half spent in front of the
screen shouldn't be the total waste of time.; Many
poor farmers in rural Northwest share his extremist
anti-government beliefs, and the routine operation turns
into shootout that would leave federal officers that.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
397668.0,North,1991.0,"And in facing some really nice people, North has to admit that his
*own* limitations prevent him from accepting them as his parents.; My suspicion is that responses to NORTH will depend on how well
     people can cope with a whimsical and kiddish perspective, *and*
     on how they have dealt with the experiences on which the film is
     based.; During the course of his search, North
visits a number of prospective families:  the wealthy Ma and Pa Tex
(played by Dan Aykroyd and Reba McEntire), the governor of Hawaii and
his wife, two Alaskans living in an igloo village (Graham Greene and
Kathy Bates), a Parisian pair laughing at Jerry Lewis, an Amish couple
(Kelly McGillis and Alexander Godunov from WITNESS), an African duo,
and a Cleaver-Nelson version of the ""ideal"" mom and dad (John Ritter
and Faith Ford).; There is a clever little sequence showing North
as a brilliant student, a top athlete and a budding star of the musical
theater, pitched at just the right level of low-key surreality; a bit
later, a series of parents chastise their children with all the things
that ""North wouldn't"" do.; He has to deal with a wacko universe, and still respond,
believably, in a relatively sane way.","Instead, it's just another part
of an 89 minute film which feels 85 minutes too long.; It's a double
insult: not only are the images of, say, the chainsmoking Frenchmen laughing
like nitrous-oxide-crazed hyenas with the Eiffel Tower looming over them not
funny, but they're not even interesting.; Wandering through this horrible mess is another character in
various guises, played by Bruce Willis (who must have been real short on cash
the week he agreed to be in this movie).; Instead, he has turned out a smug, tedious and
wrong-headed mess which wraps the moral of THE WIZARD OF OZ in a
thoroughly unappealing package.; It really WAS that
bad."
399004.0,Highway to Hell,1995.0,"The similarity to BILL AND TED'S BOGUS
JOURNEY is the type of humor used in the film, especially by Gilbert
Gottfried (ALADDIN, THE ADVENTURES OF FORD FAIRLANE) and Ben Stiller
(""The Ben Stiller Show"").; Both Gottfried and Stiller are great, although people who tend
to find Gilbert Gottfried annoying will hate his character.; Kristy Swanson (BUFFY
THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, MANNEQUIN ON THE MOVE) really makes this film.; Patrick Bergin (SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, ROBIN HOOD [1991 TV film]) is
excellent.; He also is a great asset to this film.","Pamela Gidley (THRASHIN', ""Angel
Street"") is completely wasted in this film.; Adam Storke (MYSTIC
PIZZA, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA [1989 TV film]) gives the worst
performance in the film, but part of that is the way his character was
written.; Her performance is wooden.; If you tend to hate B movies, then
you will probably find this film to be a complete waste of time.; He
didn't seem to be with the film, he seemed to have something else on his
mind when he was doing his scenes."
400070.0,Peter Pan,1994.0,"Thirty-six years after it was made, PETER PAN still
makes for a wonderfully colorful entertainment.; This year,
it's the turn of PETER PAN, a somewhat cruder film than that canine love story,
but one which manages to mix enough elements to keep the young in years -- as
well as the young of spirit -- happily entertained even after they leave they
theater.; Based on James M. Barrie's beloved novel, PETER PAN is a familiar
coming-of-age tale to most people, made all the more so by the recent
rebroadcast of the 1960s television special starring Mary Martin.; Even though the film is under 90 minutes long, it does tend to get a
little draggy towards to the end.; The scene where the children
fly over to London, following the second star on the right, is quite
breathtaking, much like those IMAX films about flight they show at the National
Air and Space Museum in Washington.","It's confusing for the younger set
and repetitious for the older ones.; They could have ended the film right there.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; In this
animated version, the former is never heard and the latter only appears in an
instrumental form backing the toothy protagonist's occasional appearances."
400321.0,Beyond the Mat,1987.0,"We see him battering his body mercilessly, punishing himself
more than most of us could bear -- and survive it not just intact, but
grinning.; Blaustein's documentary is hilarious -- frequently frighteningly funny.; Each round is planned, scripted,
choreographed and rehearsed.; That he had gotten older and fatter was no real surprise; 
it happens to the best of us.; Roberts
really brings the film down, not so much with the content of his story,
but rather the way he (and Blaustein) tells it.","Actually watching 30 minutes of it and then walking out
wouldn't be a bad strategy.; He says
they're both family-owned businesses, but fails to provide any other
evidence of similarity.; Hmmm...and weren't 
there an awful lot of WWF ""superstars"" in this documentary, and no WCW 
stars to speak of?; Instead, Mat is a biased story of a billion-dollar industry that
must have tons of skeletons in its closet.; We can be sorry for her, but the inclusion of the
material just feels awkward."
400710.0,Flatliners,2000.0,"Along the way, the director, Joel Schumacher, reminds us of
just what made 1987's THE LOST BOYS so enjoyable, and why he is one of
the best and most stylish directors making B-grade movies today.; FLATLINERS is a mesmerizing
horror thriller about life and death and redemption.; Kiefer Sutherland (of LOST BOYS) plays Nelson, who is exploring death
partially for curiosity and partially for glory.; But for the most part, the characters in FLATLINERS exist in their own
world, a world of colored lights, fog, and the night (it's almost always
night during the film, and when it isn't night it's dark or cloudy).; Kiefer Sutherland is the driven,
slightly bad guy; Kevin Bacon is the brilliant, unstable yet reliable
guy, Julia Roberts keeps us all waiting for the scene where they perform
CPR on her and in general never allows the word ""collagen"" to leave our
thoughts, etc., etc.","Things start going astray once it
becomes obvious that the film has a GHOST-like heart to it; all the
malevolence, chills and thrills of the first half start to disappear
like a vampire exposed to daylight, and the audience is left with 20
minutes of pointless exposition that leads inexorably to a conclusion
worthy only of our strongest excoriation.; For
better or worse (and the in the Phantom's opinion, better), FLATLINERS
plays more like a longform video than like a film.; It would have done credit to any 1930s
expressionistic horror film.; It's at this point the movie crashes and burns, becoming 
a second-rate horror/thriller.; Horror films tend to be very derivative."
402587.0,American Pie,1931.0,"What a 
refreshing statement to hear.; Their plans of action are thoughtful and
they think about the consequences.; ""American Pie"" is not as shocking as it desperately wants to be, but when 
it works, it works very well.; Some 
of the pairings have a disarming, and very welcome, sweetness.; Weitz and Herz have fun with their young ensemble but both
scripter and director convey a sincere interest in the lives and
concerns of these young people.","As Stifler, the 
mandatory sexist jock, newcomer Seann W. Scott looks and sounds like a 
junior Jim Carrey, giving a one-dimensional, leering performance that 
never elevates his character above archetype status.; Vicky's girlfriend is played by Natasha
Lyonne who, unfortunately, fails to live up to the promise she showed in
""Slums of Beverly Hills.""; How often do you see a film of this type where one of the male leads 
tells his buddies that he is tired of the endless chatter about getting 
laid, adding that he's going to visit with a young woman because ""at 
least she knows how to talk about something besides sex.""; Speaking of which, it may 
seem utterly ridiculous to think practically about this sort of thing, 
but I couldn't help wondering exactly how this guy expected to 
successfully masturbate with an apple pie.; There is stuff in here that is completely
gross in the same manner that `There's Something about Mary' was
gloriously ribald."
404579.0,Akira,1992.0,"It may also be the best
animated film yet produced.; It's beautiful, man!; The old ultraviolence achieves poetic splendor with top-notch
animation.; Perhaps what's most
fascinating is the graphicness to it, because we don't get to see this stuff
in America.; Tetsuo soon finds himself with amazing
powers.","I guess part of the problem has to be that Ohtomo was trying to
squeeze 1256 pages of his graphic novel into a 124 minute movie.; As live
action, it would have been concrete and therefore ridiculous.; The problem isn't the translation from Japanese to English (It is a difficult
language to translate; believe me, I wasn't so successful on some attempts to
translate some CDs I imported from Japan), but by the acting.; It's pointless,
and it doesn't really do much of anything to tell the story, much less explain
what's going on.); When heads start exploding like melons,
bright red splotches are highlighted against screaming white backdrops."
405886.0,Face/Off,2000.0,"A movie is an enjoyable theater experience that creates
memorable characters.; Six years later, Archer finally captures him in 
a beautifully executed action sequence which winds Troy in a coma and 
probably death.; Woo keeps the pace 
moving and gives us plenty of action to boot, but the key to the film 
is in the performances of Travolta and Cage.; These scenes, whose success is in large part due to
Cage's terrific performance, recall the raw, intense emotion Woo brought to
1990's devastating Bullet in the Head and his masterpiece, 1989's The Killer.; John Travolta gives a solid performance as both Archer and Castor.","But, as more
summers roll around, the worst films have become in even creating some
character development.; For one thing, it runs way too 
long (Roughly 2 hours and 20 minutes, with 10 minutes of previews).; It's just another case of a good premise
ruined by cliches, plot holes, and script a few drafts shy of greatness.; FACE/OFF runs way too long at 2:20.; FACE/OFF runs way too long at 2:20."
409289.0,My Best Friend's Wedding,2000.0,"It's really these two that make this picture fun -- and funny.; Cameron Diaz also gives a great
performance as Kimmy, the wonderfully perfect wife-to-be for Michael.; It was then to both my surprise and my delight to
find that MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING was such a success - a
strong, bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly
unconventionally quirky comic aspects, featuring a triumphant
performance from Ms. Roberts.; She does an excellent job inserting physical humor into the story
as the slightly klutzy Julianne.; Yes,
beauty and humour makes this particular lady prettier still.","A
love triangle does not work when the crux of the triangle is dull
and unlikeable.; Why
would someone as dull as Michael have two women such as Julianne and Kimmy
fighting for him?; It would have been better to stick with the premise and break 
convention, but the ending is completely sappy and predictable.; Both times I winced with disappointment at the movie's vapidity.; Personally, watching
people fall down is a cheap laugh unless it's done well (which is why I do
not really like too many Blake Edwards movies)."
409321.0,Gawain and the Green Knight,2000.0,"Although the poem, 'Sir 
Gawain and the Green Knight', is one of the best known British mediaeval 
epics outside of Beowulf, its central character is less a household name 
than other Arthurian champions such as Lancelot, Galahad, and Bedevere.; Given a year's grace, Gawain 
immediately sets off in search of the Knight for a rematch.; Its indecisive narrative may 
cause some viewers to give up before the story is half over, but in an odd 
way it adds to the atmosphere of the picture.; The course of the journey is plotted 
chronologically (the passing of the seasons), not geographically.; We can never be sure where he is or 
where different places are in relation to each other.","Since he didn't really stick to 
the specifics of the poem in the first place (with the exception of the 
opening scene), you have to wonder why he even tried a second time.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
410921.0,Nothing to Lose,1991.0,"and
entertaining.; This movie turned out to be surprisingly funny.; In short, a perfect marriage.; Although most people associate him with his
more serious parts, as in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, he has a wide
comedic pedigree from the hilarious (BULL DURHAM) to the comedically-
challenged (HOWARD THE DUCK).; It was a feel-good movie.","This seems a fatal mistake
in what is supposed to be a comedy.; NOTHING TO LOSE isn't so bad that it can 
be singled out as one of the worst movies of the summer, but there's 
nothing about this film to distinguish it from the many other sub-
mediocre non-entities currently in theaters.; The pairing of Robbins (coming off a career
high from directing and writing the enlightening Dead ""Man Walking"") and
Lawrence (coming off a career low from directing, writing and acting in
the horrible ""A Thin Line Between Love and Hate"") could have resulted in
a quirky good time, but ""Nothing to Lose"" has almost nothing on its mind
-- and the result is a 97-minute running time that feels about as long
as three viewings of ""The English Patient.""; As a result, watching films like NOTHING TO LOSE 
can be tedious.; The movie offers a few legitimate laughs, but there's 
not enough quality or quantity to support a ninety-minute production."
412160.0,Double Jeopardy,1990.0,"The second being
very enjoyable and almost perfectly believable.; The second being
very enjoyable and almost perfectly believable.; If you liked this review and want more, check out my web site at
http://www.geocities.com/hollywood/derby/3217  Comments are greatly
appreciated!; It doesn't get in the way
of the story (unlike the problems I had with last year's A"">http://www.crankycritic.com/archive98/asimpleplan.html"">A Simple
Plan), a neat package whose loose ends are neatly tied up before the
by the book heart tugging ending.; Bruce Greenwood (THE SWEET HEREAFTER) is cast as the ""now you bereave
him, now you don't"" husband.","The acting is generally mediocre though Tommy Lee Jones
has a few redeeming moments.; Bottom Line:  Ashley Judd tries hard but can't save this predictable bore.; Why someone would want to base
an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away
in the trailers is beyond me.; It is disappointing, because there are the makings of a competent action
film here.; It just doesn't flow,
giving the feel of too many writers and/or directors."
412344.0,Extraordinary Visitor,1989.0,"Immensely enjoyable.; Doyle's greatest ability, aside from a wonderful sense of humour, is an 
ability to get the best from an excellent ensemble cast.; - Friend who adopts John is surprisingly militant and is planning
     actions to destabilize Wall Street.; And Mary Walsh's performance blind to most of what is going on 
is marvellous - there's an hilarious conversation between her and 
Bhaneja with her misinterpreting his Christ-like proclamations, ""I am 
not a man"" to hysterical effect.; The whole hysteria is gently deflated by a 
highly engaging sense of humour.","Director/writer Doyle also jabs a 
number of irreverent jokes at the Catholic church - with the Pope being 
brought ordained animal biscuits and being seen being given a pedicure 
by an obeisant nun; and in one bawdy joke having a drunken John throwing 
up while in telepathic prayer communication with The Pope.; It is diverting
but hardly a serious piece of cinema.; Director/Screenplay - John W. Doyle, Producers - Paul Pope 
& Jennice Ripley, Photography - Brian R.R.; - Big yucks like seeing a nun give the Pope a pedicure and evil
     Pope's aid praying to a Mendes goat.; - Script has a lot of holes."
413327.0,Threesome,1994.0,"Tastes and morals may change, but one thing remains the same
throughout history - among all works of art the most
controversial ones are those that explore how far a human
being can go before he/she reaches happiness.; Lara Flynn Boyle is also very good as the
only female in this triangle and plays her role with a lot
of natural ease, which wasn't such easy thing do considering
that she had to appear not only naked in front of camera,
but also to play love scene that features certain sexual
activity that used to belong only in the domain of X-rated
movies.; Tensions
are high at first, but eventually the three become close friends.; There are some truly funny
moments in this film, but THREESOME is melodrama in its
nature, obviously inspired by Truffaut's classic JULES ET
JIM (which is explicitly referenced in this film), and
Fleming is not afraid to counter mostly benign humour with
some darker overtones in the plot.; Review written on September 30th 2001 Dragan Antulov a.k.a.","What could have been a lively and fairly
entertaining look at a slightly different kind of romantic triangle
instead becomes a film that tries far too hard to be *about*
something.; Unfortunately, other elements of this production are riddled with
flaws, not the least of which is a script that veers wildly from
silliness to profundity.; While the script has its clever moments, these are overbalanced by
a combination of painfully trite scenes (you have a pretty good idea
what's going to happen when the three take a picnic near an inviting
pond) and cumbersome dialogue (""Pandora's proverbial box had been
opened, but more interestingly I don't think any of us wanted to close
it."").; The film goes nowhere, and it doesn't take long for the viewer to
wonder if anything is going to happen.; Perhaps a little more genuine interaction,
and a little less reliance on voice-overs and gimmicky scenes of ""rock
tune bonding"" (designed to sell soundtracks) would have helped."
416370.0,Love and Other Catastrophes,1949.0,"I found Love And Other Catastrophes both refreshing and fun.; For the most part, the fresh-faced actors, especially Francis 
O'Connor and Alice Garner, give likable performances.; For me, Australia will always be the land of koalas, beautiful
beaches, twangy ""English"" accents, and delightful romantic comedies.; LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES runs an amazingly short 1:16, but I
bet you will think it feels longer.; My favourite is Mia as the self-centred lesbian with a crush on her mentor
and is always getting into hopeless situations.","I suppose
Croghan had to do something to spice up the material, but it might have
been a better idea to write a complete script, develop the characters and
their relationships, _then_ put together a good-looking cast of
characters.; Unfortunately, it's 
also terribly predictable, which makes it difficult to like.; The net result was that it
felt like a 60s film that was being rereleased without any restoration.; Unfortunately, that's one of the most memorable aspects of this 
unremarkable film.; seems wildly out of place, and the burnt
orange cinematography makes you wonder whether Don Simpson and Jerry
Bruckheimer hijacked the production somewhere along the line."
416545.0,Nothing Sacred,1999.0,"Winninger is perfectly cast
as the incomepetent doctor, and Connolly
does well as the blustery, despairing editor.; Hazel is taken from her small town to New
York City, where she lives in luxury,
feted by Wally and praised by all for her
courage in facing death.; Pro
wrestling is as fake now as it was then,
some reporters are still as willing to
not let the truth interfere with a great

419311.0,Ride with the Devil,1976.0,"RIDE WITH THE DEVIL moves with its own methodical rhythms
and with most of its story told in quiet moments of anguish as the
Bushwhackers hide between fights.; Enlightening, fascinating and tender,
it is the movie for those who want to get behind the lines and the
action and get to know the individuals drawn into such a hellacious
situation.; ""Ride with the Devil"" takes us behind the scenes of a
chapter in the history of the Civil War with which few today
are familiar.; The subtext--that this war brought forth a nation of
greater freedom and equality than had been known before
but at the sacrifice of a great deal of tradition--is
demonstrated effectively.; Jeffrey Wright, who wowed the Broadway world in his role
in Tony Kushner's ""Angels in America,"" gives a subtle
performance of an illiterate former slave who takes on a low-
key guise as a guy willing to fight for the southern tradition
while dreaming of buying freedom for his mother in Texas.","This wounded turkey lacks focus and a point.; The mediocre offering from director Ang Lee is a major misfire, a big
disappointment that will do nothing to further the career of its two
main stars, Tobey Maguire and Skeet Ulrich.; It was a dull film, the acting
was misplaced, the story was too distant and the dialogue was stilted.; If that's the film you want, then Lee is not the director
to make it.; The historical component of the film is
involving, but the poorly developed story is a detriment to any issues
that might be examined."

wonderfully and keeps it so well that you keep waiting for some relief,

character would see something rustling behind the bushes, would walk up to
the bush slowly, would look round the bush slowly...and.....there's nothing
there!; If it wasn't, there would be no horror genre
(for mass market), and we would be out some of the worst films of all time.; Like most horror movies, it could have been good for a laugh.; It basically amounts to a load of jump scenes put
together very slickly."

surprised and a little confused by Leslie's sudden determination to get 
chosen to be on the cheerleading squad.; Rounding out the 
three major characters, Jennifer Peluso (1999's ""Hellblock 13"") is excellent 
as Leslie.; Overall, ""Generation Ax"" may not be as purely fun as his debut 
film, ""Crinoline Head,"" but it has infinitely more to say, and does it by 
skewering such high school issues as cliques, friends, and teenage pressure, 
with a hard-edged, biting honesty that often times is very funny.; What escalates between these two 
star-crossed lovers is a bloodbath that leaves anyone who gets under their 
skin dead.","1998 - 79 minutes

form.; She also holds her own
up against the formidable Sarandon, does a great job with the kids and builds a
believable romantic chemistry with Harris.; She is excellent, bringing an innate
intelligence and compassion to this wonderful role, and her
beautifully nuanced performance should ensure she starts front-runner
to win a well-deserved second Oscar.; Grasping her dynamic, gritty part and running with it
magnificently, Susan Sarandon's mean, bitchy portrayal could earn her
the Best Actress Academy Award this year with fresh, hip Julia Roberts
claiming the Best Supporting Actress prize.; Sarandon, like always, is realistic and heartbreaking as a woman who 
realizes she has a lot of things she needs to do before the illness 
takes over her life; and Roberts gives one of her best performances to 
date, and smoothly is able to convey her character's frustration of 
becoming a second-rate parent who will never be able to equal up to the 
children's real mother.","'Stepmom' has the worst poker face I've ever seen.; STEPMOM is a big
emotional mess of a movie, one which grows increasingly irritating as
karaoke production numbers and one tearful goodbye after another chew up
minutes of screen time.; Both the characters and the
audience become victims of a bad script.; 'Stepmom' has the worst screenplay I've ever seen for subject matter
contained within its genre.; Movies like Stepmom make you wonder what exactly people in Hollywood think
of the viewing public, and why it took no less than six people to write
such a treacly screenplay."

earlier film WARGAMES.; This is one

it or not, I have never seen in a film before, is superb.; The cast for this film is excellent.","James Earl Jones was completely wasted in a cameo appearance.; His character also doesn't do
much.; He isn't on the screen for all that long and he

cameo appearances instead."
431006.0,Cinderella,1994.0,"The animation, as usual is excellent.; The reason I'm mentioning this is that it draws an astonishing parallel with
the Walt Disney of today, Pocahontas being the absolute definitive in this
respect.; As personal preference goes, it is probably my favourite of the
animation styles Disney have tinkered with so far.; At the end of the
story, the stepmother and sisters as punishment had their eyes put out, and 
their tongues cut off, and were made to wander the streets as beggars.; The Prince falls deeply in love, but because 
Cinderella must leave at midnight, he only has a glass slipper with which
to find her.","The weakest characters
surprisingly are the ugly sisters, who are rather underutilised, and
could have been depicted as more comic-evil than as they are portrayed, which
is vindictive-nasty.; I doubt
that an animated image of two women mutilating their feet would appeal
to the younger audience.; It lacks both the 
realism of earlier and recent Disney work and the minimalism of mid-period,
and is a sort of halfway-house between the two.; But
really, you can't blame Disney for ommitting these little things.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

but graphic violence, and the deprivation and suffering that
McQueen endures in prison is shown at length.; Although McQueen befriends Hoffman to use his money, he
later shows surprisingly loyalty to his friend, risking his
life on several occasions for him.; With his intense and determined personality, he was perfectly
cast to play the lead.; Once there, Papillon (McQueen) is determined
to not only survive the hostile conditions, but escape.","He is particularly good at the film's end, when his character
has become so eccentric that he talks to pigs as if they

hope to be, and he is the real star of ALASKA.; Watch especially how beautiful the
aerial shots are when they circle around the subject.; The music by Reg
Powell with its choirs and trumpets add to the majesty of the images.","No, the problem with ALASKA isn't that the people are one-dimensional
characters or mediocre actors.; Unfortunately, the horrid script and the
sometimes laughable acting make you wish for more scenes without people.; Dear
Poachers, This is very bad.; Unfortunately, these scenes, which 
include riding rapids and climbing mountains, aren't involving enough to 
allow perceptive audience members to forgive the weakness of the linking

something a bit more inspired and distinctive.; Two actors are able to transcend the tired material they are given: the

too many of Steven Seagal's early films).; I'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were

SOLDIER.; Brutality through the eyes of the innocent and

emotional potential power behind it, and the opening scenes tap into it a

in which it captures the day-to-day, mundane aspects of the human
experience.; Even though her seemingly-happy
marriage is doomed from the start (Isn't this true of all happy
marriages in noir films?; Not only is she superbly
acted by Martha Plimpton (playing against type as the shy, reserved,
small town girl), but Nelson's script does an excellent job of getting
into her head and uncovering her hopes, dreams, and motives.; Kevin Anderson is also effective, although his role is somewhat
less original and ambitious.","The fundamentalist ""villain"" has become
too much of a cliche over the years -- an easy target for film makers to

bloodied, unable to speak, as the police are startled to see him in this

is because the acting from  the leads is so convincing.; The film opens in the town of Kingfisher, Oklahoma, where a blood-
drenched, 15 year old boy, Tommy Spencer (Nick Stahl), is discovered
wandering around late at night.; As a philosophical excursion, EYE OF GOD falls short of
the greatness to which it aspires."
449084.0,Mermaids,1999.0,"The movie is mostly comedy with one melodramatic episode and it's
the kind of movie with wonderful one-liners that people are going to be
pleased to quote to each other.; The evocation of '63-'64 is almost flawless (I saw a
couple of impossible details in set decors, but that's pretty good);
certainly the spirit of the times beautifully invoked.; It's funny, and entertaining,
and it leaves you feeling good at the end.; Most importantly, it allows Ryder and Cher to play off
each other and the vivid, often hilarious clashes that ensue make this a
delight.; I was in tears during the
entire scene, it so perfectly brought back exactly what that experience
was like for all of us who were alive then and old enough to understand
it.","The
comparable moment in MERMAIDS, which involves a room painted and lighted
to look like a fantasy of the bottom of the sea fails; the audience does
not enter into the vision, it merely sees Cher momentarily entranced by
it.; One minute she wants to become a nun (though she is Jewish), she
is fixated on Catholicism), and the next she is praying to be raped by the
26-year-old hunk who is the caretaker at a nearby convent.; ""Foot Friendly"" at least sounds like a take-off on the phrase
""user-friendly,"" but MERMAIDS is set in 1963, before terminology like ""X-
friendly"" was familiar or perhaps even invented.; The script's worst
faults are its lulling the audience into believing the material would be
light-weight, and a gratuitous piece of suspense toward the end that
cheapens the effect of the film and makes it seem more manipulative where
earlier it had been more sensitive.; The second is that the
script apparently calls for Lou to be Jewish and from the Midwest and the
role is something of a stretch for actor Bob Hoskins."

the film began to change somewhat on second viewing.; Fritz Lang's M was made in 1931, in a Germany witnessing the rapid
growth of the Nazi party.; My uncertainty as to M's meaning was heightened when I started to
think more of the creative forces behind the movie.","Clearly, its

made because of the authoritarian bureaucracy present everywhere, and
perhaps to the atmosphere of the film (the latter point being
subjective).; The film is presented as a sort of dream, with a narrator voicing
over scenes to describe the character's emotions or thoughts at times.; Stylistically it is an achievement, but
the viewer will have to decide if it is really is an entertainment
experience.; The story centers on Leopold Kessler, an idealistic young American
of German origin, who returns to Germany right after the end of World
War II (late 1945); his return is something of a goodwill gesture.; The film is very stylish -- in fact, the stylishness gets
in the way at times.","Capsule review:  A weird and hypnotic film, but
     ultimately a disappointment.; To summarize, I would describe the film as a stylish fantasy, that
is of only mediocre quality.; A stylish fantasy that is interesting, but of only average

working a car wash, is equally embittered by the cards life has dealt him.; Chappelle adds an interesting dimension to his film by imbuing his main
characters with social consciences.; Jimmy and Art share an activist past and
have outspoken views on society's injustices.; Chappelle opens his film with a subtle pre-credit sequence in which Jimmy
tends to the needs of an everyday, and moderately annoying, customer.","Her
provocative behaviour encourages the advice ""Just coz you ball half the
civilised world don't mean you have to advertise it!"".; This
doesn't mean that Chapelle has crafted a headache-inducing labyrinth, ""The

will often take your breath away with unexpected moments of quiet
majesty and beauty.; Perhaps more than any other films before or since, German
silent cinema created compelling images that tap into universal race
consciousness, portraying grainy, moving archetypal images all of us
vaguely recognize from dreams or nightmares.; Take a friend; this is definitely a film you'll want
to dissect over several capuccinos.; On the surface, CAREFUL (1992) is a tribute to German ""mountain
films"" of the late 1920s.; Jackie Burroughs does a brilliant bit part as the puritanical teacher,
who closely resembles the Cloris Leachman role in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.","Enough of the aesthetics, what is the film supposedly about?; If Hollywood's recent output is just too brain-numbingly

insurance policy before getting on the plane.; Dean Martin (yes, the
crooner and Jerry Lewis's former partner) is an airline pilot in love with a
flight attendant (Jacqueline Bisset).; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.; Dean Martin was never much of an actor and perhaps his biggest claim
to fame in movies was as the James Bond rip-off character Matt Helm.","The man who made 'Airport' is George Seaton, a director not really suited to
this material but he does do a somewhat decent job although he's no Irwin
Allen.; 'Airport 1975', 'Airport
'77' and 'The Concorde: Airport '79' were mediocre at best with the latter an
absolutely disastrous disaster film but the the first film is entertaing to a
point but can't back away from becoming a full blown soap opera.; While 'Airport' is no classic, is does have a few trashy moments of cheap
thrills but nothing you'll jump up at.; For an actor of his stature, Burt Lancaster is completely wasted as an
airport official managing a crisis in the air from the ground assisted by
Jean Seberg and George Kennedy and the rest of the cast is a mix of talent
and movie stars thrown together for an odd mix.; It simply can't decide what kind of
movie it is, thriller or character study."
465950.0,Almost Famous,2001.0,"Crowe has also assembled an excellent supporting cast, including Hoffman

rebellious Anita, and Fairuza Balk and Anna Paquin in small roles as

An entertaining movie from top to bottom: an interesting story, superb
actors, rockin' soundtrack, well-developed characters, a strong message, a
nice love story, top-notch directing, humor, drama and two star-making turns

that by being warm, genuinely touching, and very funny.","I could have lived without the tumultuous scene in a plane where everyone

unwelcome attention of Lt. Grey (Tom Courtenay), the camp's provost
marshal.; For him, the end of the war is a more pressing
concern than it's continuation: he believes that the Japanese will
kill all their prisoners before surrendering; Grey has vowed to get
even with him when the war is over; and a liberating soldier intimates
an investigation into his activities after the evacuation.; Performances are first-rate all
round, from John Mills and Denholm Elliott right down to bit parts
like Leonard Rossiter.; Even those who don't like war movies are bound to enjoy George Segal's
assured performance as Corporal King in this adaptation of James
Clavell's novel.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

467857.0,Rich Girl,2000.0,"I really enjoyed RICH GIRL and feel that it is a very good film.; The acting in the film is good and the plot is somewhat original, but
very enjoyable.; I recommend this film more to teenagers and people
in their early twenties because I feel that they would enjoy the film
more than adults.; RICH GIRL has a good rock soundtrack.; I found RICH GIRL to be very entertaining.","The
video box cover for RICH GIRL also seems to resemble the video box cover
for PRETTY WOMAN.; The posters were so
obscure that no one had any idea what the picture was about, and hence
no interest was generated.]; Don't be one of those
people.; The February
1992 PREMIERE magazine discusses it (among other films) as having
suffered from an incredibly bad publicity campaign.; For some reason RICH GIRL was not very popular in the theaters,
which I can't understand."
468960.0,Missing,1998.0,"Lemmon is fine, and his confrontations with
American officials are the best scenes of the
film.; Spacek is also good, although her character
isn't as defined as it should be.; This respect may be due to his embracing
their political philosphies, once it becomes
apparent to him that the lying American officials
were behind the coup and care little about the
life of his 'troublemaking' son.; However, this presentation of a
third world nation's military coup is believable.; He has several
generation gap arguments with Spacek, but gradually
learns to respect her, and the son he never really
knew.","After that, the film becomes
repetitive, and is interesting mostly for
Lemmon's outraged performance.; These scenes are like some science fiction films
set in the future, with the resisting ""humans""
on the wrong side of alien search and destroy
missions.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

470275.0,Affliction,1984.0,"The acting is extraordinary, the story is captivating and the
atmosphere is chilling and effective.; In
one of his best, most heartfelt and moving performances in a long
time, he brings a sense of sympathy and compassion to his complex
character.; Like most of
Schrader's works, it is not a feel-good movie, but it is powerful
moviemaking from a man who has mapped the darkest terrain of the human
soul.; This is the breakout performances of the
actor's career, and he leaves no margin for error in his portrayal of
the troubled sheriff.; Like the recent American History X, Affliction is an important
film dealing with a serious theme, and deserves to be seen.","Is it some sort of requirement to have a
chase in every movie?; By giving away the
store during the initial minutes, Rolfe has destroyed most of
the tension that the story could have developed.; Wade's brother Rolfe (Willem Dafoe) delivers an off-screen
narration, giving away a key point of the plot.; Reduced to being little
more than a glorified traffic cop, he is increasingly frustrated by
his demeaning role.; His scripts for ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"" lead directly into
this one."
472078.0,In the Name of the Father,2000.0,"But the real gem in
this movie is powerful and unforgettable performance by Pete
Postlethwaite, character actor whose moving portrayal of
Giuseppe as quiet, simple but morally strong man is actually
overshadowing Lewis.; The start in
Northern Ireland (5%) was fascinating, the trial scenes (5%) were
excellent, and the amazing detective work (2%) was great.; This is a well-crafted film in all regards.; Ms.  Thompson's court speech alone is worth the price of
admission, and represents one of the most stirring moments in recent
cinema.; Pete Postlethwaite did a
moving portrayal as his father.","This 88% itself was slow and tedious.; did illegal activities (which a later jury did not), but I do
not buy the massive scale portrayed in the picture.; Surprisingly, Emma
Thompson is considerably less memorable in a script that does not use her
considerable acting ability.; IRA terrorist (and fictional character) McAndrew
(Don Baker) is inserted to make obvious a cover-up
by British policemen.; The main problem I have with IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER,
problem that, I must admit, has something to do with my
experience, is in the fact that movie doesn't actually
tackle some important and universal question."
472538.0,Angie,1932.0,"Together,
the two work perfectly.; The transformation may not be elegant or seamless, but it gives this
movie a distinction of originality, a trait which has become
increasingly scant in Hollywood productions.; But it also represents a welcome change
that the film is willing to break away from the expected norms and
spring a series of surprises on the audience.; The key to enjoying ANGIE is to not anticipate the expected.; Those that go in with an open mind--and a willingness
to overlook a number of minor faults--are more likely to enjoy the
picture than those who approach it with certain preconceived notions.","The rest of the cast is adequate at worst,
including Aida Turturro in a part that could have been written for
Rosie O'Donnell.; One of the reasons the movie survives the second-half melodrama is
because the acting keeps things at a high level, even on those
occasions when the dialogue turns stilted.; This
frothy motion picture turns serious in a hurry.; There's nothing so bland
as a movie whose next events can be predicted scenes in advance.; For the first half, the storyline is pure romantic
comedy, complete with the two boyfriends--each representing a
different lifestyle--and the various subplots and complications."
473334.0,My Generation,1996.0,"Barbara Kopple, the two-time Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker who most
recently directed Woody Allen's Wild Man Blues, gives us a striking look at
the three Woodstock festivals in My Generation.; If anything, the film is a great way to catch a wide variety of music from
the likes of Green Day, Metallica, Nine Inch Nails, The Who, Country Joe and
the Fish and a pre-pop-chart Santana.; The fun starts in February 1994 and shows the behind-the-scenes genesis of
the 25th anniversary show, from the Saugerties town meeting to get the
permit (set to Primus' ""Here Come the Bastards"") to the merchandising
efforts to provide consumers with everything from Woodstock condoms to
Woodstock dog tags.; A big chunk of the film focuses on Michael Lang, the perpetually calm
producer of all three events.; There isn't one mention of the rapes in '99 but plenty of
coverage of various security check problems (people weren't told metal tents
weren't allowed until they were at the gate), drugs, injuries and, of
course, mud.","Nothing seems to faze the guy, even though he
claims the original Woodstock concert has just broken even within the last
few years (which is why you had to be bombarded with Pepsi advertising just
to see DMX).; There are nice segues between people proudly stating
that ""it isn't about the money"" and giant, baby-killing corporate sponsors
selling $20 slices of pizza.; 1:43 - TVMA for adult language, nudity and drug use The review above was posted to the

474596.0,One Fine Day,1974.0,"The ending is superb.; Distributor: 20th Century Fox ONE FINE DAY has all the ingredients of an enjoyable romantic 
comedy:  a decent premise, likable leads, and a solid supporting cast.; **** Amazing, potent stuff.; The movie was relatively enjoyable, with fine performances by Clooney
and Pfieffer.; I suspect that working parents of kids under twelve
will find that the humor works and the catastrophes of the story hit
home.","Unfortunately, the movie is empty, 
unfunny, and unromantic until the last 10 minutes.; Unfortunately, the movie throws in a dozen subplots, few of 
which are interesting.; Mr. Clooney is not yet the Big Leading
Man that the hype would have him be, while Ms.  Pfieffer is stuck
struggling in a oddly unsympathetic role.; And then there is a scene with a kitten that is just 
so stupid it's not even funny.; Director Michael Hoffman (RESTORATION) overdoes it on
every possible front-- plot, music, repartee, etc.-- that the end result
is too much movie."
477386.0,Wild Things,1987.0,"It also
has to be one of the most sexual, and most ambiguous.; As the story unfolds, we find that many things aren't exactly as they
seem (that's as much as I could say without ruining anything).; The scene's a real hoot.; He adds the intentional humor.; Bacon is solid, and so is Dillon (while continuing to
prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world !","A big problem I had was that the film spent way too much time trying
just to confuse the audience.; It's campy, it's cheezy as cheetos, and half the time it careens from one plot
twist to another in a paint by numbers fashion.; A typical guy should just go nuts for this sort of trash,
easily giving it a rave review.; So we get the old `Refusal
of sex?; I mean, how many male fantasies are
NOT presented to us on the screen?"
478194.0,Sleepwalkers,1997.0,"It gets a bit
strange in some places, and the film gets very unrealistic at times, but
is still fun to watch.; This is
something that Kathryn Bigelow did to perfection with her excellent
first feature, NEAR DARK, a film which will likely remain the final word
on modern retellings of the vampire legend for quite some time; it's
also a film that is ""paid homage to"" throughout SLEEPWALKERS.; Garris
keeps the film moving, and many individual scenes are quite effective.; And the ripoffs come fast and furious, starting with BLUE
VELVET and continuing with, among others, NEAR DARK, AN AMERICAN
WEREWOLF IN LONDON, THE SHINING, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and LIFEFORCE.; He goes to the local high
school and he gets to know beautiful, but unpopular, Madchen Amick.","In short, SLEEPWALKERS is a horrible disappointment.; It is boring, confusing, laughable, *un*-scary, and decidedly
*un*-interesting.; Unfortunately, the effect of this is to make us wish we'd taken our
$7.50 to Blockbusters and rented NEAR DARK instead of using it to
encourage Stephen King to write still more bad screenplays and
collaborate in yet another disappointing horror film.; The problem is that Stephen King expects us to take this tripe
*seriously*.; Naked bleached
blonde space vampires abound, though sadly there are no messy ice-pick
murders."
478914.0,Hush,,"Jackson's mother Martha (Lange) runs 
Kilronan all by herself, and her genteel Southern hospitality makes Helen feel 
welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with Martha takes place while 
Helen is in the altogether, caught red-handed after a bedroom romp with her 
husband-to-be.; Veteran performer Nina Foch is smart and tart 
as Jackson's wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother.; You can see through a great deal of Martha's 
actions and lies from their conception; why do people who have known this woman 
for years longer than we have never figure things out?; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.; Perhaps ""Hush""'s title 
is a plea to silence its audience's likely bitter word of mouth while exiting 
the theater.","It's too bad that ""Hush"" 
is so laughable, because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of 
Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Lange -- is nothing to laugh at.; Chalk its 
losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering 
(it was supposed to open about a year ago), the latter of which appears to have 
given ""Hush"" a send-off that's downright infuriating.; If any of her potential victims thought, 
acted or behaved like normal people,""Hush"" would be a really short movie.; It's just 
there, dangling amidst silent displeasure.; The rest of the cast looks 
ill and uncomfortable, especially Paltrow."
482063.0,Aladdin,1990.0,"Romance, enchantment, magic, a little violence, some pretty
innocent cruelty, and a good deal of humor mixed together makes
ALADDIN a wonderful movie for everyone.; The Genie (Robin Williams' voice 
is perfect for him) has a lot of impressive imitations of real people 
and brilliant fast-talk all the way.; Jafar realizes that the prince is the boy whom he hired to get
the lamp, and soon everything is set for a masterfully depicted
struggle between good and evil.; Iago is a very fun character, and his position
as Jafar's talking parrot is extremely enjoyable.; All in all, Disney has managed to create a spectactular and very
humorous animated feature that is one of the most light-hearted of
them all.","Even telling that story would
not have been a bad idea, but the film goes desperately wrong with its use
of Robin Williams as the genie of the lamp.; The animation is sufficient but the extremely uneven tone and the
almost total lack of fidelity to the story make this a lesser effort from
Disney.; This one is a solid disappointment.; Disney is often less than faithful to source material.; Try asking if it is even as good as THE LITTLE
MERMAID."
485358.0,Ever After,2000.0,"She's
definitely more headstrong than most previous Cinderellas.; Dodds, as the bitchy
stepsister, is perfect, while Lynskey (who was fantastic in Heavenly
Creatures) is likable as the good stepsister.; Scott is also very
good (and very funny) as the spoiled prince.; It is equally refreshing to see a love story that has time to
develop.; It is incredibly refreshing to see a movie with a genuinely strong female
character.","I found it annoying and boring, even for a cartoon, with
the magic pumpkin and talking mice simply uninteresting.; The story seems pointless.; There is some humor to the movie,
but unfortunately, not enough.; She has a sort of hurt-child look that might be acceptable for
this role, but does not quite work in the scenes in which she is
supposed to be a formidable fighter or look stunning.; Theater on the screen is usually lifeless."
489170.0,Angel Face,1998.0,"The film scores big because of the great nuanced
performances from the stars Robert Mitchum and Simmons, the sharp black and
white photography contrasting the wealthy estate to Mitchum's humble stature and
rosy dreams, that the tale of obsessive love was credibly presented, and the
typical noir tale of the protagonists getting hooked on sex and money gave the
film the dark energy it thrived on.; Ambulance driver Frank Jessup (Mitchum) answers the call to the
Beverly Hills mansion and when he tells the attractive stepdaughter, Diane
(Simmons), that her mother will be fine she only requires a sedative, she gets
hysterical and doesn't seem all that pleased.; The law accuses her and Frank of murder, and their case goes to trial.; The result was that this was arguably her best
film performance and Otto, a known bully to actors, came up with an intelligent
and exciting thriller.; It's a film noir that is influenced by Freudian
psychology, and was shot in 18 days by Otto Preminger.","Even though she looks angelic,
behind her serene beauty is a need for possessiveness and an unbalanced state of
mind.; She thinks someone wants to kill her for her money.; She
fails to tell him there is a delay because her mother's lawyer is out of town.; Warning: spoiler to follow in the next paragraph.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

490728.0,On the Waterfront,2001.0,"Cobb is
excellent as the menacing union boss.; In bigger roles, Karl Malden is
typically awesome as the rousing priest, and Eva Marie Saint, who won an
Oscar for her performance, is downright wonderful as the loving but
vengeful sister, out to stop the men who killed her brother.; Watching
Brando is one of the greatest experiences in all of film history, and his
Terry Malloy is one of the best performances by an actor ever captured on
celluloid.; Soon, not only does he run into the man's daughter, Edie (Eva Marie Saint,
later playing the mischeavious girl in Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest""),
who begins falling for him, but also Father Barry (Karl Malden), who is out
to get the workers to unite and rebel against the harsh treatment by Johnny
Friendly and his goons.; Eva Marie Saint won Best Supporting Actress, while Malden,

496449.0,White Heat,1997.0,"It also
helps that the direction is tight,  the story is
filled with action, the script has the right mix
of colorful slang and one-liners, and the
supporting cast (except for O'Brien) is excellent.; The film's ending involves an industrial
plant that suffers massive explosions, and has
Cagney shouting 'Top of the World, Ma!'; Still, any minor problems that ""White Heat"" may
have do not interfere with its status as an
entertaining, intense crime drama.; In ""White Heat"", pathos is added to his character,
giving him even more opportunity to dominate
scenes and demonstrate his talents.; as the
fireballs swell.","The script does has some psychobabble, and the
revealing of the Trader's identity seems unlikely.; O'Brien is competent, but curiously dislikable,

497682.0,Trust,,"Hartley also makes great use of silence.; A very unique, surprisingly touching ""dark-comedy.""; The strength of the movie is the manner in which Matthew and Maria
interact and learn to trust each other.; Trust is hard to come by these days, and in Hal Hartley's quirky
movie, TRUST, it's even harder.; Maria and Matthew begin to change in their relationship.","She's the most unorthodox of mothers.; It is the only blaring weak spot in the film.; You point it in the
wrong direction; you might kill somebody.""; But you'll be hard-pressed not
to enjoy this slickly directed, bam-out-of-a-low-budget movie.; ""It's no use."

from Chris Rock's Bigger and Blacker.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","But you have to wonder if the writing isn't even worse.; Start off with the story, which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is --
is the least offensive part of the movie.; The film is inexplicably set
in the 80s, a period piece that really shows no sign of its period
except for a few chicks in leg warmers.; Everything
about this complete tripe is ludicrous.; So much of the
dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for Carey's virginal target
audience that it's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with
aplomb."
502979.0,Little Women,1948.0,"Fueled by excellent performances from Winona Ryder (the

defunct drama ""My So-Called Life""), Kristen Dunst (who gets my vote 
of approval just for saying kissing greasy Brad Pitt in INTERVIEW 
WITH THE VAMPIRE was ""yucky"") and Susan Sarandon (obviously, 
she plays the mother), LITTLE WOMEN is thoroughly entertaining 
without the usual 90's Hollywood hang-ups of sex, violence and 
profanity.; No, this movie doesn't feature the many girlfriends in the life 
of Tattoo from ""Fantasy Island"" (located two miles east of Gilligan's 
Island), it's an adaptation of the classic Louisa May-Alcott novel about 
the Civil War days... and a darn good one at that.; We see two hours of 
their trials and tribulations, with moments of tense drama and female 
bonding.; I wasn't too thrilled 
about two hours of repressed women in bustles, but once I gave in to 
my feminine side (I know you're snickering right now, so just stop it), 
I got into it.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","The main character, Jo, wants to be a 
writer (let's not draw any parallels here), while the other sisters just

times.; (gasp!)"
504943.0,Smoke,1995.0,"Rachel Portman's score is put to good use,
as all of her great scores are, and creates a nice, simple atmosphere
for these simple tales.; It's 
well worth seeing.; Highly effective.; It celebrates, in many ways, the power and beauty of the word along
with friendship, bonding, and generosity, which makes it a distant
kissin' cousin of the recent THE POSTMAN.; I recommend this delightful and sweet movie to you and
award it ***.","Sometimes this is
interesting, often it's just tiresome.; I find it hard to believe, even in a movie, 
that any black teenager would hang out with fifty-year-old white guys.; Director Wayne Wang (of THE JOY LUCK CLUB) has taken a story in
the vein of TWENTY BUCKS and basically dragged the comedy out of it in
favor of giving us a talky melodrama.; In short you either die of lung cancer, a heart attack or

and a very good choice for anyone looking for a traditional convoluted
mystery flick.; The best of the Brabourne/Goodwin 70s film adaptations of Poirot
books.; The pace is great, the twists and
turns maintain interest, and the performances are first-rate.; It involves the exploits of Hercule Poirot as he endeavors
to solve a series of murders aboard a steamboat traveling along the
Nile river in Egypt.; I'll even give Peter
Ustinov a nod for those who aren't fans of the book--while totally
faithless to the ""je ne sait quoi"" ambiance of Christie's Hercule
Poirot, it is an engaging performance in its own right.","Murder mysteries don't get much better than this.; A beautiful but
abrasive heiress has been shot through the temple in her cabin aboard
a Nile riverboat during her honeymoon cruise.; A large, sweaty, overbearing
interpretation of Christie's Belgian detective, Ustinov sports ""les

his patented Jack-Webb-with-PMS performances.; I
have seen NIKITA several times since that summer and each viewing
brings only more appreciation for a wonderful film.; I have not seen NIKITA, the film this is based on.; Those who watched - and liked - NIKITA will probably be pleasantly
surprised at the faithfulness of POINT OF NO RETURN to its
inspiration.; It has several very strong aspects, but also several that
don't seem to work very well.","I found him to be an annoying bore who detracted from what
was interesting to me, the relationship between Bob abd Maggie.; J.B. especially
lacks the underplayed sensitivity of ""Nikita""'s Marco.; But it is
amusing to have Bancroft enjoin her pupil : "" Say  'I feel badly, not 'bad'

his determination to survive by denying his friendship with

Horst, whose pride and defiance balance his sanctimonious outbursts, and 
Webber convinces as the fragile Rudy.; For those familiar with existential works,
you will fare better.; Those with the power wield it cruelly and arbitrarily.; When Martin Sherman's
drama opened on Broadway seventeen years back, it moved
many in the audience to tears and elicited a review from the
New York Times 'Powerful and provocative,"" while Women's
Wear Daily called it ""an explosive, overpowering experience.","Unfortunately, what begins with an interesting premise and a 
promising first half quickly devolves into a boring, muddled, 
melodramatic love story.; The final scene, which is supposed to be a triumphant crowd-
pleaser, comes across as obvious and overplayed.; It
would have been better if Bluteau had a more interesting co-star: how about
Jagger as Max?; BENT 
is obviously an important story for him; it's just that he and writer 
Martin Sherman made too many bad choices in adapting the play.; Bent is far too much like Woman in

eight years in the future, where Sethe (Oprah Winfrey) lives in isolation

arrives from out of nowhere.; Demme, following Winfrey's lead, does not attempt to simplify or
launder Morrison's tale, a la Steven Spielberg's widely criticized take on
Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple.""; Glover's work as Paul D reminds us once again what a powerful actor
he can be when he's not wasting his talents on tripe like ""Lethal Weapon 4,""
and as Sethe's ""charmed child"" Denver, Kimberly Elise is outstanding.; There are some wonderful lingering
shots of the natural surroundings, and the most visually compelling scene
is the one in which Baby Suggs preaches to folks in the woods.; It's not a showy, let's-win-an-Oscar star turn, but a quiet,
devestating piece of character work.","Instead, it's a thematic mess
that takes translates every aspect of the book with no explanation.; In defense of Newton however, the ethereal
Beloved may be an unplayable part; any actress would have been perplexed by
this character who is alternately sprite and succubus, child-woman and
madwoman.; Why they almost
immediately have sex is inexplicable, as are many elements of this
ultimately disappointing film.; Maybe too

effect of machinery, skillfully portrayed in mime by the dancers).","Personally, although he gives a skilful performance in a very demanding
role, I found Tony Tanner overbearing and very irritating after a while, and
if one finds Littlechap tiresome, the show loses a lot of its appeal.; Cast:

Additional Material by: David Donabie, Al Ham, Alan and Marilyn Bergman As the overture commences, we are presented with a sequence of monochrome
still photographs, of a theatre musical director waving his baton; of scenes
in a recording studio, with the principals, chorus , conductor, a large
orchestra, surrounded by microphones, booms and other equipment; of scenes
in the theatre dressing rooms as the principals and other performers the
actors preparing for the night's performance, applying their custumes and
make up, with a particular emphasis on Tony Tanner's transformation from
almost unrecognisable everyday self to the white faced clown Littlechap.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; It caught the mood of the time with its comments on social class
and politics, and (some would say, banal) attempts to make a statement on
'the human condition'."
514135.0,Addicted to Love,1996.0,"It's damning with faint praise to say that, for all of its darkness,
this is one of the best romantic comedies recently.; Both are excellent.; Tchéky Karyo is perfect as Anton.; His understated style blends nicely with Ryan's
edgy chutzpah, and kudos to whoever put Ryan in those tie-dyed
dresses: They definitely become her.; Into Sam's cozy world comes Maggie, played by Meg Ryan in her best
comedic part since WHEN HARRY MET SALLY...  Ryan, who is one of the
most talented actresses working today, is probably most enjoyable in
her funny parts, but, to be honest, it is in her serious roles as in
COURAGE UNDER FIRE and, one of my personal favorites, WHEN A MAN LOVES
A WOMAN that her greatness shows best.","She
has a sappy, annoying tendency to write 'Dear John' letters which is an
unpardonable offence in the 'TMT Voon Books of Courting Etiquette'.; But even with everything this movie did right, it just doesn't add up
to greatness.; Screenwriter Robert Gordon could have gone
for all-out farce in which the motivations of the characters mattered less
than their wacky actions; he could have made Linda and Anton so
one-dimensionally villainous that they seemed to deserve whatever they
got.; Why is she so abrasive?; Frankly, the title seems like an afterthought."
514328.0,Best Laid Plans,2001.0,"It is
an well made piece of filmmaking, and tells it's simple story in an
entertaining way.; His calm, cool collectiveness is great on-screen, and
he carries the whole movie.; ""Best Laid Plans"" won't grab you in the way that ""The Usual Suspects""
does, but it is a fine homage to the way film noir used to be made;
with multilayered characters, strong-willed women, and people who
pretend to be something that they're not.; ""Best Laid Plans"" may not be
sport the clever dialogue of some of David Mamet's films on
similar themes (""House of Games"" comes to mind), but as a
puzzler that inventively blends humor with chills, Barker and
Griffin's film is more than worthy of our patronage.; Brolin is excellent as the
panicky, nieve Bryce, and while most actors would completely overdo the role
he's playing, Bryce makes his panic seem believable, not laughable.","The weakest link is
Brolin's annoying Bryce, but in his defense, a lot of that is the fault
of the writing; Bryce displays very few, if any, redeeming qualities,
making one wonder why Nick would keep him as a friend--and thus removing
any resonance from the whole ""betrayal of friendship"" theme.; It seems to have the style of a thriller but without
the substance.; There is no feeling for
characters or intensity in this story, it looks contrived from the
get-go.; Unfortunately, style seems to be
slightly more important than story, and occasionally the story does suffer
due to the director working more on the look of the film.; The story revolves around these three
uninteresting characters."
515357.0,Tremors,1999.0,"The desert setting, drowsy and stultifying on the surface,
is used to good effect, and Bacon and Ward give effortless performances
that match this to ""Perfection.""; That primal consciousness is, I believe, what
makes this film so instantly appealing to its fans.; Most movies of this type (THE
THING, THE BIRDS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, et al) invariably hole up
the protagonists in a restricted location, which they defend against
the attacking hordes.; Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are two jacks of all trades who own a
pickup truck and little else, drifting from one job to another in the
small desert town of Perfection.; THINGS ...","To some people, the term ""B-movie"" translates as: low quality
film-making.; I cannot describe TREMORS in terms of any superlatives -- there is nothing
original about this film, there is nothing in it that stands out as
exceptional, and there is nothing particularly memorable about it.; Film's major problem was trying to
sell the idea of giant earthworms as effective movie monsters.; Most of the second half of the film
involves this assorted handful of characters arguing about their
predicament and hopscotching from one 'safe' zone to the next.; Worse, these worms are predators, which detect their prey by the
vibrations of their footsteps."
515435.0,If Looks Could Kill,1998.0,"Like the old Punch cartoon of the country vicar being served bad
eggs by his bishop: ""Parts are excellent.""; The woman who plays the French teacher is rather wonderful as is the
madman intent on stealing all the gold in Europe, Hunt's boss (?).; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Obviously, I couldn't.; The bad guys include Linda Hunt, having a lot of fun with a bad German
accent and a gold whip that does double duty as her necklace.; Also unfortunate is the skimpy special effects budget and enough
editing errors to fuel r.a.m.; Unfortunately,
the movie slows down occasionally to take itself a little seriously, to
introduce the love element, and to make room for a couple of MTV videos.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
517972.0,Swimming,1997.0,"Highly recommended.; It is a moving, enjoyable film
with likeable, well defined characters, and an engaging story.; Although not perfect, the film should be
commended for its intelligent approach.; The pace of the film is unhurried, so the viewer is steeped in
Frankie's world and is allowed to get close to the characters'
emotions.; It is a pivotal time when decisions
are made about what they want to do with their future.","Another film may have used the assistance of voice-over narration to
allow the main character to directly express her inner thoughts to the
audience.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; This is a slow, character-oriented drama primarily
about teenage angst."
526223.0,I Love $,2000.0,"The film is mesmerizing because it keeps you
on your toes.; Adroitly and seductively presented, the film is fascinating, albeit
perhaps not for the reasons the filmmaker intended.; This first segment implants in our subconscious that people make money
mainly to manipulate those less fortunate.; Documentaries work best when they challenge your assumptions and make
you think.; This continues the theme
of the rich exploiting the poor, and this time it suggests that they do
it illegally without ever being caught.","Sandwiched between reasonable arguments are a host of
illogical ones and ""facts,"" which are clearly anything but.; This visual has absolutely nothing
whatsoever to do with the story.; It is not rated but might be PG-13
for brief, partial nudity and would be fine for kids old enough to be
interested, which probably means teenagers.; The exasperating editing and cinematography are the movie's weakest
links.; I (heart) $ runs too long at 2:25."
527570.0,Rebecca,2000.0,"""Rebecca"" is one of the more deeper and stranger of the Hitchcock films,
as it deals more with psychological terror than espionnage terror.; It's
an unforgettable film, and further proof that Hitchcock was one of the
best and freshest directors around, and who's timeless classics make him
one of the best directors of all time.; The film unfolds beautifully.; Certainly
much credit is due to all concerned, since ""Rebecca"" is one 
of the greatest films ever.; Judith Anderson was also nominated but lost, but I think she should have
won for her Mrs. Danvers is one of the most intriguing and bizarre
characters in all of film history.","Although at first the film looks as though it's
going to go all cheap and have the new Mrs. de Winters just become the
old Mrs. de Winters (who was drowned), the film steers clear of that
notion, although drifts near it from time to time, and instead goes for
something creepier.; Three?; The entire film
is mired with gothic creepiness, creating moments where I was just
afraid because of the feel of the film.; Five?; Unfortunately, Hitchcock goes into the same club of extremely talented
directors who have never won an Oscar for their efforts, inclduing such
noteworthy directors as Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick."
528384.0,"Sorry, Wrong Number",1986.0,"The film sustains the suspense until the very end, as it now
becomes a question if she will survive the attack and how will Henry
react as he calls her at 11:12 P.M. and hears from her that Morano has
been arrested.; This
popular radio program was rebroadcast seven times between 1943 and 1948,
starring Moorehead in a role that she had made famous.; This brings back
memories of how she met her husband eight years ago at a public dance,
where she boldly stole him away from Sally.; Evans
tells her that Morano has been arrested.; It takes Leona a long time to realize that she is the one targeted to be
killed.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

529161.0,Lenny,1999.0,"Bruce's
act was controversial at the time but his performances often revealed the
hypocrisy present in everyday society and since his death he has developed a
sense of cult status and the film about that part of his life is definitely
worth a look.; Hoffman is perfect in the part.; Dustin Hoffman (who just turned 60 on August 8th) portrays Lenny Bruce who
played nightclubs, made record albums, some obscure films and got arrested
more than any other performer would today for his stand up comedy.; He looks comfortable in the
role and just as impressive is Valerie Perrine who plays his wife.; Hoffman and Perrine have a chemistry that is very natural on screen and the
film is told in flashback from the beginning of the picture as she talks
about him after his death.","Foul language is appropriate in film as long as its part of the story
and doesn't become too repetitive.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
529207.0,Crime Wave,2001.0,"The plot revolves around the
familiar noir tale of an innocent man trapped in circumstances beyond
his control.; This low-budget B-flick was very entertaining.; The men split and Morgan
flees to the apartment of an ex-con gone straight, Steve Lacey (Gene
Nelson), who is reluctant to help because he has a good job as an
airplane mechanic and has married a good wife, Ellen (Kirk).; Lacey is taken to the police station and grilled by Lt. Sims (Sterling
Hayden), a hard-nosed detective, who doesn't believe criminals can
reform.; It is
noteworthy for its great B&W location shots of the busy L.A. streets and
of capturing a noir look of alienation.","Three escaped felons from San Quentin rob a gas station and kill a
motorcycle cop, with one of the men, Morgan (Young), getting severely
wounded.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
530743.0,Instinct,,"Gooding gives a top-notch
performance, and the actions of his character make the speech seem
appropriate.; Screenwriter Gerald Di Pego (who also wrote Turteltaub's PHENOMENON)
does a great job of introducing Theo's character.; Theo gives an emotional speech at the end.; His ingenious gamble
helps a paranoid patient have a breakthrough.; All the sparkling good ideas were memorable enough to grab onto and
examine more closely.","It
seemed like a waste of Elfman's particular talents.; I couldn't tell if you if it was too sweet or too
insubstantial, but somehow, the recipe just wasn't right.; It's too easy
and obvious and it doesn't add to the character or the film.; Replace ""psychiatrist"" with ""hostage negotiator"" and you'd
have the same opening scene as two or three cop movies in the last year.; Their few actions are motivated by the script and not by any emotional
soul."
533374.0,Carousel,1961.0,"The film version of ""Carousel"" is excellent,following the show
quite faithfully in its retelling of the doomed romance of carousel
barker Billy Bigelow (who was called Liliom in the Hungarian play)
and mill worker Julie Jordan.; star Gordon MacRae.who was perfect
for the role,and gave his best acting performance ever in the film.; Aside from this, ""Carousel""has been very well
directed by Henry King,and the score boasts such memorable tunes as
""If I Loved You"", ""The Carousel Waltz"", ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" and
the deeply moving ""Soliloquy"".; ""Carousel""is one of the
great movie musical adaptations,beautifully filmed in Technicolor
(partially on location in Maine,and on the beach at San
Francisco,where Gordon MacRae sings the ""Soliloquy"".; The show is based on""Liliom"", a once-popular,and now seldom revived
play by the great Hungarian playwright,Ferenc Molnar,which had itself
already been filmed three times-a Hungarian silent version,an early
talking version in 1930,and a French version in 1934 starring Charles
Boyer.","The only performer who falls almost
completely flat is Susan Luckey as Billy's daughter Louise,who has
zero acting ability but dances very well.; Instead of showing the afterlife scenes as rather
eerie,and the ghosts as ghostly (as was unforgettably done in the film
version of ""Our Town""(1940),we get a blue backdrop with styrofoam
stars hanging from wires and very realistic -looking people who are
supposed to be ghosts.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
537129.0,Original Sin,2000.0,"The fun lies in the mounting
array of twists and surprises which, together with some solid
lensing by Rodrigo Prieto in various locales of Mexico (which
stands in for Cuba) makes the experience of watching the movie
a must-see for fans of bodice-rippers and less than subtle
melodrama.; Moving in with Luis and instantly getting 
married, Julia and Luis are both taken by surprise when they find that they 
truly are connecting and falling in love with one another.; Both actors bring an 
unexpected intensity to their roles that often manage to hide the technical 
inanities of the film, and for Jolie, this is her most challenging and 
impressive turn since 1999's ""Girl, Interrupted,"" for which she won an Oscar.; This is a Harlequin romance for adults, a guilty
pleasure especially for fans of the two engaging stars.; It's certainly one that I
haven't heard of before.","But as soon
as Boy actually finds Girl, instead of following what might have been a
promising (or at least not completely fucking boring) thriller, the film
degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since
Milk Money.; The result is a 
vapid, uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses, as 
likely to incite a yawn as a thrill.; Cristofer doesn't 
even manage to capture the allure of Cuba; instead of portraying his 
setting as a steamy, sensuous island paradise, it appears bland and 
lifeless.; They just do not have an iota of chemistry
and since the characters are so one-dimensional, it is hard to care about them.; Add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in
cinematic history (literally half of the film is either in slow motion
or uses a strobe effect), and acting roughly the caliber of a B.B."
540743.0,Serendipity,2000.0,"It's a 
delightful romantic comedy about two lovable people 
destined to be with each other.; From the first frames he sets up the right atmosphere
of fairy tale romance; contributing mightily to that is John de Borman's
cinematography, which captures all the visual splendor of winter in the Big
Apple (a sight that is even more powerful and magical in light of recent
events).; The magic and mystery of our fated encounter is
also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very
romantic Serendipity.; What happens then
is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates -
involving such items as mistaken identity, a Graduate homage, John
Corbett as a freaky New Age musician, and Eugene Levy as an irate and
crazed salesman -- to find out if that ""thing"" was right after all.; And 
we can enjoy this pleasant film because it makes us 
believe that there is someone out there for all of us.","It was all so superficial and predictable.; As for the fiancés, each is given one mildly annoying behavior to
justify being dumped.; If
she's a villain, then he's an idiot for being duped by her.; Cusack mainly suffers
from having to be attracted to a ridiculous character, but Beckinsale is
forced to make one unbelievable move after another by Marc Klein's script.; Rarely, though, is a
romantic comedy as cheap, as obvious, or as pointless
as Serendipity, a film that uses its ""theme"" as an
excuse for its plot contrivances."
542816.0,Speed,1972.0,"But, onscreen, it works very well building some fun and
highly tense scenes.; In the Yost tradition, Speed is definitely high concept but because it has
a talented rookie director behind the camera, Speed works very well.; Keanu Reeves is great as Jack Traven.; Thank you for small favors.; There's more,
and this all works out for the best.","No guns would've been needed--but a
plane would crash, and a nun would sing, and the girl would get kissed
at the end.; The premise is pretty simply and on paper it seems
pretty ludicrous.; (If this all sounds like one of those TV infomercials,
""AND THERE'S MORE!; Or a banner beside Reeves that reads
""To avoid personal injury, do not stand in stepwell.""; The script is by Graham Yost and that explains the silliness of the plot."
546567.0,Shine,1996.0,"But despite these minor
flaws, the film works as a good and original drama that combines the power of
music with the human spirit.; And it works very well.; With
some incredible performances, expect to see this movie on many best of
the year lists.; In small parts, beautifully done, are:
the great, amazing, versatile Sir John Gielgud ( David's teacher in London)
who will be 93 in April 1997 (Aries); Lynn Redgrave (the astrologer who
marries David and helps his recovery), a youngster of 54 (in March 1997),
sweet and lovely ; the charmingly named Googie Withers (David's good,
understanding friend) who, though not a major star, enhanced more than a
dozen, mostly British films from the late1930s to the mid-1950s.; Rush's frantic jabbering as the insane adult Helfgott so perfectly
captures the mood that he deserves (and is receiving) serious notice.","(He doesn't even use a hand
double!); Blame better movies
like MY LEFT FOOT, whose tortured heroes were a world more-accessible
than this one.; It just seems too easy to put all the blame for
David's dementia on his abusive father.; If it weren't real, this part would
have been ludicrous.; Rush
seems to be getting the most attention for the role, but all three are
interesting actors."
547883.0,Summertime,1987.0,"""Summertime"" is a slight film compared to Lean's other works, such as ""Dr.
Zhivago"" or the underrated ""Ryan's Daughter,"" but it is superbly acted,
well-written, and subtly directed.; Brazzi makes a perfect companion for Hepburn: romantic,
charming and charismatic.; For those of you who remember ""Only You"" - the sappy romantic comedy
with Robert Downey Jr.  set in Venice - this is far superior to that film.; She's also one of our most versatile
actresses with a body of work that includes ""The Philadelphia Story,""  ""Adam's
Rib,"" ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" and, one of her last great roles, ""On
Golden Pond.""; You'll have a delightful
time with the invigorating ""Summertime"" - it is more than a travelogue of
Venice.","The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
549514.0,Fatale,1999.0,"I think the film is extraordinary on several levels.; Malle makes you
perfectly aware, by the end of the film, that a woman like the one Binoche
plays is an all around menace, but you still mourn Irons characters loss
of her as much as you do his loss of his wife and son.; In the end, what we are left with is a
paradox - technically great, excellently paced film with
good scenario, that in the end leaves us indifferent to the
story and characters.; Louis Malle made reputation, among other things, by breaking
taboos and making films about forbidden expressions of human
sexuality - like incest or paedophilia.; Carefully shot, with beautiful musical passage strewn throughout, this film
is slow, but it is attractive, with excellent acting throughout, and it
manages to keep us wondering where it will all lead.","DAMAGE is an incredibly slow-moving boring film that is a complete
waste of time.; The
characters are boring and invoke no interest from the viewer.; The only way to describe his acting is
wooden and uninspired.; Actually, hardly anything is appealing in this film that
takes place on the grey interiors and exteriors of London
and under the eternally cloudy sky.; This
award is named for the '92 film, notable for trite dialogue, inept
direction and anatomical correctness."
556678.0,Emma,,"Jeremy Northam, who harassed Sandra 
Bullock in THE NET, is an excellent choice for the dashing Knightley.; Paltrow, who was excellent in 1993's FLESH AND BONE 
(before moving on to films like SEVEN and THE PALLBEARER), displays the 
essential characteristic of an actress wishing to play a Jane Austen 
heroine -- the ability to shift quickly and effectively from comedy to 
drama.; Distributor: Miramax Films It's the romantic buried inside each of us that responds to movies 
like EMMA.; After 
successfully marrying her governess (Greta Scacchi) to a widower (James 
Cosmo), Emma sets her sights on pairing her plain, uncultured friend, 
Harriet Smith (Toni Collette), with the local vicar, Reverend Elton 
(Alan Cumming).; She can cry, look wistful, and deliver a biting line with equal 
believability.","Only Ewan McGregor 
(TRAINSPOTTING) appears miscast, although he gives the part of Frank 
Churchill a game try.; The reason dates back to last year's CLUELESS.; More than one marriage is arranged (five, to be precise), the 
heroine is a strong-willed woman with a disdain for social conventions, 
the ""principal"" couple doesn't find love until the closing moments, and 
there's at least one scene of ballroom dancing.; Alan Cumming is suitably smarmy as Reverend Elton.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
564702.0,Hercules,1999.0,"While not as rock-solid as HUNCHBACK, it's a still a new world
of improvement over POCOHONTAS.; Rip Torn makes for 
a nicely authoritative Zeus.; All in all, I would recommend this film to all kids (mind you, I
don't see this becoming a classic by any stretch of the imagination),
and some adults who are interested in viewing a quick (88 minutes),
harmless animated story about the Greek Gods, and some hip, quirky
one-liners from James Woods.; Hercules was a very enjoyable film, and although I didn't leave the
theater humming the music, I can sing its praises.; Memorable for playing many jittery, dangerous
heavies, Jimmy's real persona is funny, and very close to the Hades
character, and Hades is played as a stand-up comic trying to take over
the universe.","""Too boring!; Boring ballads we expect, but boring production numbers,
too?); The most disappointing aspect of HERCULES is the amateurish quality 
of the artwork.; Hercules is boring, clumsy and pure muscle with no brain.; However, the songs for last year's HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME were generic 
and lifeless, and there's little sign of improvement here."
565594.0,Freaks,1998.0,"They seem so childlike in nature and
close-knit, as they bond together for protection from a hostile outside
world.; Back in Cleo's carnival wagon, she poisons Hans' drink, but Venus
confronts her former sadist lover, Hercules, and threatens him unless he
tells the doctor treating Hans about the poison.; The wedding celebration turns into a macabre scene, that is both vexing
and titillating to a certain degree.; Looking at those who are pinheads,
limbless, dwarves, a bearded lady and her baby bearded girl, twins
physically attached to each other by the hip, and the assorted other
real freaks used in this film, has its initial shock to those not used
to seeing the abnormal, but that should soon wear off and what remains
is how sympathetic the audience becomes to the freaks, who are part of a
travelling circus sideshow.; The obvious themes of the film are that there is strength in numbers,
that the beauty of an individual should be judged by their inner
character and not by their outward appearance, that we are all human
beings and that to mock someone else is like mocking ourselves, and that
one shouldn't prejudge individuals in a biased way.","Their roles were just not that interesting.; MGM  has foolishly edited out 30-minutes of the film, thus reducing this
B&W horror film to around 63-minutes.; First billed and all around
good guy Phroso (Wallace Ford) isn't interesting,
while the character of his girlfriend Venus (Leila
Hyams) is muddled.; Cleopatra passionately kisses her
obnoxious strongman in front of the groom.; The price paid, is that character
development for some of the subplots fails to materialize with any
conviction felt."
567610.0,American Outlaws,1996.0,"""American Outlaws"" is good-hearted and good-natured fun that isn't going to
bump anything off of the best western film list.; He displays humor, charm and
wit and does a darn good job performing the tough stunts and horse riding.; But, what it is really all about is romance, intrigue, shootouts, horse
chases, lots of things blowing up, revenge and justice.; Gregory Smith (""The 
Patriot"") also acquits himself well as the younger Younger brother, who 
insists on riding with the gang.; ""American Outlaws"" succeeds despite its rehashing of the
James legend because it avoids reinventing the wheel.","The biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of Colin Farrell.; Its only reason for being is to show off a few studly
young actors shooting pistols and riding horses.; While some of the sparring is amusing, other dialogue
is unintentionally gutbusting ('Don't turn around.; Alas, any sense of
his character has been left on the ranch, leaving us with only cute
chicks like Ali Larter (minus the whipped cream) to watch.; Not to mention: The real story of Jesse James and his gang bears no
resemblance to the plot of American Outlaws."
567896.0,Funny Girl,1998.0,"I don't think anyone sees ""Funny Girl"" to hear Julie
Styne's music, although ""People"" is one of the great classics of
the American musical theater.; This ""Funny Girl"" can benefit not just the nostalgic buffs but
many young people who may be familiar enough with Barbra
Streisand--for whom the musical and the movie were made--but
who long for the chance to see her in her first Oscar-winning role.; ""Venn he vas vit his
friends,"" Jackie intoned, he vould tuck luck mih--'Suh, tell me,
Hoib, yoh daughter, she getting merried soon, nu?'; Yet the faded
colors lend an pleasant, old-fashioned look to the project, which
is desirable.; We want to see modern technology bring to life
what otherwise would be impractical to show to today's audience
who are not diehards loving to see the fragmented silents at
places like New York's Museum of Modern Art.","By all rights Fanny Brice, born likewise in a poor Jewish
enclave on New York's Lower East Side, then rising to become
an entertainer, might have switched from an ethnic accent to a
bland inflection.; Rated G.  Running time: 155 minutes.; Ignoring the script, she turns a serious finale about the
joys of being a bride into a comic spin in which she appears at
the altar in the final stages of pregnancy.; In one of his Broadway shows Jackie Mason would pull this
shtick.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

569867.0,Boiler Room,1999.0,"Still ... quite
entertaining.; Well,
I certainly enjoyed it plenty and it sure does give you a little more
insight into the mighty worlds of cold-callers and stock dealers.; An enjoyable movie going experience.; The film itself may start on shaky legs, but once it gets
going, this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie which does an excellent job
showing us how the lust for money can corrupt us all.; Nia Long is excellent as a secretary (and
possible romantic interest) at J.T.","* - One of the worst movies ever made.; * * - Pretty bad, see it only if you've got nothing better to do.; But all these good pieces don't add up to a
coherent whole, and this film ultimately fails, falling apart in a formulaic
and repetitive second half that loses whatever points it had been making.; A particular misstep is his attempt to show
the effect that Seth's manipulations have on one of his poor victims.; Perhaps in an attempt to ape David Mamet's shark-eat-shark drama
""Glengarry Glen Ross,"" Younger's script is proudly profane and goes out
of its way to make almost all the major characters thoroughly
unpleasant."
580301.0,No Escape,1999.0,"He played one of
the scariest ex-cons ever in Jonathan Demme's Something Wild and has
been excellent in many other shows since, e. g. , GOODFELLAS and
UNLAWFUL ENTRY.; The more you think
about it, the less it holds together, but this is not a motion picture
designed to withstand careful scrutiny.; In
fact, Liotta is an actor--and a pretty good one at that.; Filmed in Australia, NO ESCAPE boasts gorgeous scenery, and it's
easy to accept Absalom as a lush hell.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).","The worst performance belongs to Kevin
Dillon, whose whiny, poorly-realized Casey should have been excised
from the screenplay.; Maybe if they had
edited it down to 30 minutes, it would have worked as a ""Twilight Zone""
episode, but 1 hour and 58 minutes was way too long.; The script by Michael Gaylin, Joel Gross, and Richard Herley
was full of nonsense laced with failed attempts at humor.; The major failing of the movie is that of the director,Martin
Campbell, and the script writers.; In this movie, he is, well, boring."
580316.0,Pocahontas,1998.0,"Wrapped inside an entertaining shell, POCHAHONTAS deals with the
importance of following your heart and respecting others.; While it may not be as classic as BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and while
it may not earn as much as THE LION KING, Disney's 33rd full-length
animated feature, POCAHONTAS, is an intelligent film that is
entertaining for all ages.; And it easily deserves a place among the spiritually rousing films
of all time.; While not as meaningful as ""Colors of
      the Wind,"" it is a wonderfully spritely song sung by the astounding
      Judy Kuhn.; POCAHONTAS is an animated movie of incredible beauty.","Maybe it's just me, but
I could hardly tell them apart, just padding, they advanced the plot not
one iota and half of them were completely unescessary.; The songs are 
substandard and there are way too many of them.; The best line was Smith's ""Don't worry I've been in worse scrapes
than this, but I don't remember any right now"" which sounds like it was
lifted verbatim from one of the plethora of LETHAL WEAPON movies.; But
in Pocahontas the dreary score is just dreadful.; That is over ten minutes of advertisements we
were forced to watch."
591619.0,Message in a Bottle,1994.0,"In Message in a Bottle, you feel the spray of the ocean, the power of the
waves, as the wind captures the sails of Garret's boat.; Wright Penn is beautiful and believable,
Costner is deliberately aloof (yet likable anyway), and the
legendary Newman is fine as the imperfect father.; It is
schlocky and disposable at times, but makes for a decent romantic
diversion.; The injured souls' romance is believable and
touching.; Overall, though, Message in a Bottle is an entertaining outing.","Predictable to a T, bitingly sweet, it just wasn't a movie I could
connect with.; It's one of the worst endings I have ever seen,
because it serves no purpose other than to provide a cheap (and
emotionally manipulative) effect.; The ending, out of left field, is
cinematic manipulation at its worst.; But
no,
the story has an unnecessary quarter-hour tacked on after it, which
only serves to capsize the preceding 120 minutes and render them
completely invalid.; Don't just
stop making mainstream trash, but stop making films that rub off as
insulting to women because they portray them as drooling idiots."
591662.0,No Looking Back,1999.0,"That girlfriend is Claudia (Lauren Holly), and, after picking up 
the pieces of her life following Charlie's departure, she has moved on, 
shacking up with one of Charlie's old school buddies, Mike (Jon Bon 
Jovi).; We do not wonder that since the roguish Charlie deserted her
when she needed him most and fled to California months
after making Claudia pregnant, his return to Rockaway Beach
at first seems to dismay Claudia as much as it does her
current live-in.; Holly gives a quiet, realistic spark to her first lead role; she is the 
truly is the ""babe"" that the entire cast always seems to refer to her 
as.; Holly had never really impressed me before, but does a decent job with
the task that she's been assigned in this film.; Claudia (Lauren Holly) has a 
simple life that seems to suit her well -- she spends days waiting 
tables at a local greasy spoon and nights with her live-in boyfriend 
Michael (rocker Jon Bon Jovi).","It's not that the
film is bad...it's simply boring.; The worst case is Lauren Holly, who 
presents a completely bland Claudia.; While Burns the director and actor are fine, Burns the screenwriter is 
to blame for the movie's lack of ignition.; Instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the 
proceedings, Burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly 
towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion, offering precious few 
momentary pleasures along the way.; When he released THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, Edward Burns was revered as 
the wunderkind of the 1995 Sundance Film Festival (Robert Redford has 
apparently stuck with him -- the aging actor/director executive produced 
this mess)."
592759.0,When a Man Loves a Woman,1999.0,"This is a relatively new tale and
educates about the circle of life--i.e., it is more realistic than the
fairy tales and is still every bit as entertaining.; He was the jester in this film but was
perfect as it--a true entertainer.; Dennis
Hopper plays one of the most memorable villains in the movies this year
with a roll full of hilarious one-liners and maniacal laughter.; A true classic.; Again, great
music and a wonderful job of weaving in America's main events in the
declining road of history with the simple and innocent life of Forrest
Gump.","CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER (***)
==============================
     A disappointment.; So much potential wasted.; But the 
movie would have been much better if an actor with more depth -- say, 
Nick Nolte -- had gotten the role.; Tom Clancy's core is there, and
that along with Harrison Ford save most of this film, but the director
tore this apart and added long-winded and pointless dribble between the
basic skeleton of a story by Clancy.; They smile way too
much."
598075.0,Vertigo,1996.0,"Kim Novak plays a wonderful dual 
performance with a tremendous amount of range, believable both as the 
frigid Madeleine and the earthy Judy.; The
Hitchcockian touch at resolving this romance is sheer genius as it breaks
new ground in the way it treat film lovers on screen.; The
Hitchcockian touch at resolving this romance is sheer genius as it breaks
new ground in the way it treat film lovers on screen.; It's one of the most frightening and brilliant scenes in
movie history.; Everything is perfectly placed.","But this is also why the film fails: its
usage of the classical elements are so obvious and predictable they seem more
cheesy and stupid than thematic.; Stupid.; Most of the performances are
satisfactory, but the motions the characters go through are dull and
repetitive.; This feeling of acrophobia  or vertigo is nothing more than a plot
device.; It's just too bizarre to take seriously... or however we're
supposed to see it."
614825.0,Julius Caesar,1988.0,"And it's the most
essential part of the role of Caesar.; He's good.; It's the most powerful part of
the entire play, and Gielgud just says it like he's thinks he's some
great Mr. Theatre.; The story takes an original approach
to it, showing it from the perspective of one of the major accomplices
in the assasination of the great Roman leader - Brutus, who is seen as a
tragic anti-hero, who is too easily influenced by some of his peers.; John Gielgud...or, as I have been calling him lately ""Coolest Old Man
with a Goatee""...is pretty good as Caesar for awhile.","Yes, the guy's supposed to be in deep
thought, but Robards just looks like he's looking at the cue cards the
whole time.; Which
is basically what this film is lacking in: feeling.; Too
bad they all don't live up to the bard's text, proving that the names of
all these great actors doesn't mean that they're ALWAYS great.; But he's just not up to
this role at this point in his life.; But it goes nowhere with it."
621121.0,Thief,1999.0,"Mann, who has made other films such as 'The Last of the Mohicans' (1992) and 
a great companion piece to 'Thief' entitled 'Heat' from 1995 with Al Pacino and 
Robert De Niro and the force behind the 80's television series 'Miami Vice', 
chooses his camera angles carefully and uses tight editing and feisty
lighting in 
'Thief' that enhances the film's final outcome.; Also scripted by Mann from the 
book 'The Home Invaders' by Frank Hohimer, it has a flow of such natural 
dialogue to match the best crime scenes ever filmed and the characters are 
totally unsympathetic for an extra focus on reality.; The film's basic message is survival and uses the old morality statement that 
there is no loyalty among thieves and the picture's original music score by 
Tangerine Dream and the arresting cinematography by Donald Thorin impact 
the story just as well as any academic thought the director ever had.; A retrospective movie review by Walter Frith Director Michael Mann's moody crime film 'Thief' from 1981 is a film of such 
slick, original and invigorating visuals that it's hard to imagine the film
made any 
other way once you've seen the entire thing.; James Caan is a lifelong thief who has spent over a decade in prison and can't 
reform his ways after release.","It bothers me sometimes 
that motion pictures take a protagonist who chooses the wrong path in life and 
they are made out to be sympathetic.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
643571.0,Unbreakable,1998.0,"Excellent!; This may disappoint those expecting just another atmospheric thrill
ride: ""Unbreakable""'s deliberate and erudite style makes for a very
different cinematic experience.; At times he
succeeds, and those grand hushed segments are a welcome change from the
noise and clutter of most films.; Jackson is
one of the better actors of our time, and here he turns in yet another
great performance as the ever injured Elijah.; It's engaging, it's
mysterious, perhaps even unbelievable to the more cynical in our society,
but ultimately the film is an excellent demonstration of what a great
director, a solid script, a deeper, meaningful message and well crafted
characters can bring to a theatrical presentation as such.","But his adherence to a
recycled formula is disappointing all the same.; Sadly, the answer is neither, though an overexcited populace
spoon-fed on a year's worth of hype is likely to lean toward the latter
owing to severe disappointment.; Prepare
yourself for rampant symbolism (and, unfortunately, at least one, extended
product placement that I found annoying).; The banal talk in ""Unbreakable""
cannot sustain the weight of Shyamalan's movie, making this
one a disappointing follow-up to his superior work of last
year.; He seems to walk around as if in a trance, virtually catatonic to the point of being a zombie."
644519.0,U Turn,1994.0,"Believe it or not, I enjoyed ""U-Turn"" a lot.; But, although much was different 
about the way the movie was put together, it still bears many hallmarks 
of recent Stone productions.; Yet, although Stone has clearly 
made this motion picture with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek, he 
nevertheless manages to capture all of the tension and mystery necessary 
to hold the viewer's interest.; He now makes a u-
turn in his career without giving up his favorite theme--what
characters do in extreme situations--and comes up with a fun
movie, one which allows him to relax a bit and send up a few
Hollywood gems of the genre.; Nevertheless, for those who enjoy movies on the edge, U-TURN offers just 
the trajectory you might expect.","Make no mistake,
there is no misunderstanding Stone's latest film 'U-Turn' as it is simply a
low key re-hash of 'Natural Born Killers' given a soap opera twist, wretched
characters whom we care nothing about and the film is blatantly pointless.; I'm not a big fan of this sort of camera trickery, 
since it seems designed more to show off a director's pretentiousness 
than to add anything significant to the motion picture.; Rated R.  Running
Time: 125 minutes.; We are not 
supposed to sympathize with this guy.; If this
sounds like 'Double Indemnity' in the wild west, it just might be."
648723.0,Whipped,1998.0,"It's not romantic and it's not
sexy, but it's definitely got some yucks and should be a definite tool of
the trade for those still in the dating world.; The frank
portrayal of jesting character attacks between male friends is
accurate and entertaining.; Credit Amanda Peet for delivering yet another charming
performance and Judah Domke for having some of the funniest lines in the
movie, as the one guy in the crew who is ""happily"" married.; It was also very, very funny and contained great dialogue!; And despite a certain feeling of deja-vu, this film does move along
nicely, delivers a cool soundtrack and for once, gives us a little more
insight into the women's point of view.","WHIPPED, however, features some of the worst acting this side 
of a high school play.; To say Zorie Barber acts poorly would be far too kind.; The movie, which badly wants to be a THERE'S 
SOMETHING ABOUT MARY version of DINER, has a script that is disgustingly 
crude but almost never funny.; You 
wouldn't think that a writer or director would have the courage to film a 
romance with nary an ounce of heart or soul, but Cohen has done just 
that--and fails miserably at every turn.; Jealously and hormones rage, but Whipped
becomes bogged down with contrived voice-overs make the film choppy and
annoying So what is Mia's story?"
656563.0,Rich in Love,1987.0,"The dynamics of their interaction is representative of
what is happening in so many young families today.; They are human with the strengths and foibles common to real
people.; There are secrets
that lie just beneath the surface and the emotions that these two go
through run the gamut from quiet affection to open hostility.; RICH IN LOVE has a lot going for it, including a
certain warmth and character insight that many movies lack.; We can understand and empathize
with each of them - their flaws, their fears, their dreams, and their
hopes.","There are several story lines with dramatic potential that
are introduced only to be ignored.; The creative team might have
been better served to go with a more ambiguous ending instead of one
without the same spirit and deep sense of character as the rest of the
film.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

657811.0,Lassie Come Home,1998.0,"My son Jeffrey, age 7 1/2, gives the
picture thumbs up and says, ""I liked it a lot!""; One of my favorite parts of the film is the music by Daniele
Amfitheatrof.; What makes the story, scripted by Hugo Butler and Eric Knight, so
endearing and fresh is the pureness of its emotions.; I first saw this movie at
the very early age and it was one of the most memorable
movie experiences in my life.; But even those who don't appreciate
this social aspect of the film would enjoy it, because it is
well-told and interesting adventure story, full of not so
spectacular, but really moving and memorable scenes.","It is not rated, but would get
a G.  There is no sex, nudity, or bad language.; At first glance, LASSIE COME HOME might look like nothing
more than standard Old Hollywood tearjerker.; They did not even have enough for a
full meal for the humans in the family.; Well, at least they put up
a good front.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
668372.0,Nobody,1994.0,"""Nobody"" is a conventional action-thriller that works particularly well 
because of director Ohkawa's expertise in stylish filmmaking, with a noir 
undertone and a collision of effective, chic elements, including moody 
camerawork, a memorably creepy music score, and thrilling action setpieces.; A substantial amount of suspense is mustered up in many masterful scenes, 
including one in which Konishi foolishly meets the two remaining villains in 
a restaurant, expecting to simply talk with them, and another in which Nambu 
has a confrontation with an unidentified man in a black car that takes a 
violent turn.; The color scheme of the film only adds to the atmosphere, as 
the night scenes are lit in varying shades of blue and black, while the day 
scenes are painted as gloomy and rather pallid.; In Japanese with English subtitles.; Just when they begin 
to realize they probably will never see them again, they unexpectedly come 
into contact with one of the culprits and beat him up in the same manner that 
they did to Konishi.","Shundo Ohkawa's direction is meant to be glossy, high-tech, but suffers
from being amateurish and outdated, overrun with trick camera shots to
capture the violence.; Worst of all is the film's last few 
seconds, which are a complete and utter letdown that shows Taki has not 
actually won anything.; The protagonists were three unlikable snobs, concerned
with their image, talking about name-brand products as if someone was an
idiot who didn't adhere to their tastes, and getting into the tussle
because they were loudly attacking the other table for being tacky.; Unfortunately, ""Nobody"" becomes problematic in its cheap conclusion and 
wrap-up section, which includes a terribly-performed, artificial scene 
between Taki and his girlfriend, which, to begin with, is an inadequately 
developed relationship that has not earned the right to be as emotionally 
rewarding as it's supposed to be.; NOBODY (director/writer: Shundo Ohkawa; cinematographer: Hiroshi Ogata;
editor: Yoshio Kitazawa; cast: Masaya Kato (Taki), Jimpachi Nezu
(Detective Karaki), Riki Takeuchi (Nanbu), Hideo Nakano (Konishi),

next table are dressed."
695489.0,Mrs. Doubtfire,2001.0,"MRS. DOUBTFIRE is great fun.; He was very funny with the kids, and they loved him unlike
his wife who decided she could not stand him.; I STRONGLY recommend this movie to
everyone and rate it *** 1/2.; You can feel his pain in this movie, and his humor is
incredible.; But MRS. DOUBTFIRE manages to carve out its own
space, particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a
judge's decision and the ultimate status of Daniel and Miranda's
relationship.","Most of the gags here do not even require the major premise of the film,
they are just generic learning to cook gags.; I will not say I was a big fan of TOOTSIE, but at least it attempted a
little more substance than this light-weight comedy.; Too many of the scenes are just
obvious and mechanical.; Not the least of these flaws is that even using a
bodysuit and mask, the Doubtfire costume would take on the order of fifteen
minutes to put on and perhaps as long to take off.; The plot of MRS. DOUBTFIRE is a combination of worn-out formulas,
silly coincidences, and weary contrivances."
707037.0,Stalked,1988.0,"Of course, really, this is the story of restauranteur Brooke
Daniels.; The opening sequence, contrived quite a bit, brings
Daryl and Brooke (the victim) together.; When Daryl returns, he
enters the house, of course, so our heroine is in danger.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.; He overdoes it, in other words, but he still
manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story
demands.","Synopsis:  A mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy
from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's
mother, a fledgling restauranteur.; Events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and
stalked, where only one survives (guess who it invariably always is and
you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey).; STALKED receives two stars because, even though it is highly derivative and
somewhat boring, it is not so bad that it cannot be watched.; Comments:  STALKED is yet another in a seemingly endless string of
spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable
category in the 1990s film industry, both theatrical and direct-to-video.; So we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts; no
guesswork required."
715305.0,Sugar Town,1997.0,"A thoroughly enjoyable
movie, it is full of laughs, small and large.; A solid ""B"" film.; It's the
kind of work that Robert Altman does well and, considering my mixed
feelings about Anders' Grace of My Heart, a major improvement and a
delightful slice of life tale of folk both rising and falling in the
Hollywood entertainment industries.; As a rabid supporter of the independent film scene, this act of daring
and unconventionality pleased me immensely.; Better than those two, however, is
Brenneman, who is a refreshing breeze of believability amid the inanity;
and the killer duo of Jerry and Ben Stiller, who deliver the film's only
funny moments as Cate's father-son superiors at the record company.","Instead, we see
dull caricatures that are but pawns in a poorly conceived game.; Jade Gordon, playing a selfish mediocre singer, is annoying (but perhaps
that's her job).; That
the Stillers only have (at most) five minutes of total screen time shows
how tedious and, worst of all, painfully laugh-free the rest of the
film's scant running time is.; Their lead song, ""gravy-stained
girl,"" sounds terrible, at least according to Nerve (Vincent Berry), a
devilish 12-year-old recently dumped on Clive's doorstep.; Unlike _Sugar_Town_, where the lesser plot threads are evened out by
more interesting ones, the focus in _The_Suburbans_ lies squarely on the
film's least interesting character: Danny--hardly surprising, since Ward
is also the director."
717552.0,Network,2000.0,"Paddy
Chayefsky's dark exposé of this industry, Network, is savage, hilarious,
and strangely powerful.; Terms that should not be used 
to describe it:  ""light,"" ""breezy,"" ""inconsequential,"" ""amiable,"" 
""pleasant,"" and ""hilarious.""; Each
performance, no matter how minor, is excellent with particular
standouts being Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway.; It gets its point across very well through its pungent darkness and
Chayefsky's amazing script.; This is Lumet's message to the audience, and it, like 
NETWORK, is just as pertinent today as it was in 1976.","Network starts out with idealistic people
like me in mind, but then let's us know that there is absolutely no
room for realism where money and ratings are involved and leaves us
behind in the first fifteen minutes.; In fact,
if there was only one weakness in the entire movie it would be that in
some scenes the dialogue is so unbelievably cruel that we can't
believe that people actually talk like this.; In an attempt to reverse its fortunes, UBS decides to can Beale 
and bring in someone new.; However, most of the credit should go to the script which was written
by Paddy Chayefsky who actually worked for a large network before
turning to screen writing.; Since then, however, 
television in general, and the news in particular, has become so openly 
grotesque and sensationalistic that NETWORK's finale seems more credible 
than appalling."
723186.0,Dracula,1997.0,"""Excellent!""; Absolutely perfect!; Absolutely
amazing.; This understated actor's range
is incredible.; The interior of the castle was
especially well done, I feel.","I found most of rest of the cast extremely forgettable.; Much of the acting was wooden
for far too long.; She is dull and self involved and the character never changes
from this sort of ""lifeless"" state.; The connection between feeding on victims and sex
is bludgeoned into us, using so heavy-handed an approach that even a
seduction/rape scene involving three women is nothing more than a
turn-off.; Unfortunately none of this passion shows up on the screen."
736566.0,Duel,2001.0,"This is because Matheson's sharp but
simple story works almost entirely on a primal level: territorial
dominance and the battle for survival.; ""Sugarland
Express"" is a witty, subtle road movie that has a stunningly powerful
conclusion.; Weaver, best known for his cowboy detective McCloud, is an unusual but
effective choice for the role of the bewildered, victimized motorist.; ""Jaws"" is the best blockbuster Summer movie ever
made.; Spielberg's early triumph in this film is still one of his most
memorable achievements.","Even though
it was intended for television, film's pacing and tension is hurt by
ad breaks.; Think of that awful ending to ""Amistad"" or
the glutionous saccharine sentiment that is all-pervading in ""Hook""
and ""The Color Purple"".; What could any
man do when faced with this fume-spouting monolith ?; Indeed, it's very _lack_ of anything
unusual becomes suspicious.; Mann is quite
obviously Man, and his blood-red car is as nondescript and generic a
vehicle as you would find."
738404.0,Armageddon,1941.0,"Billy Bob Thornton plays the leader of Mission Control, and it's very
refreshing to see him be given a normal part for once, after years of
playing Southern grotesques.; ""The Tears"" is the
chapter in Tom Wolfe's novel The Right Stuff that describes John Glenn's
heroic Mercury orbital flight in 1961 and the stunning, overwhelming
reception that he received on his return.; ""Armageddon"" prides itself in being glossy but has no real delusions about
what it is and what it isn't, and while this isn't totally commendable,
it's still mildly distracting for 2 1/2 hours, and admittingly very
entertaining, which is something which is pretty good for us every now and
then.; Armageddon, the second of this year's death-from-above thrillers (the
first being Deep Impact), has entered our atmosphere.; ""Armageddon"" was directed by Michael Bay, who directed ""Bad Boys"" and the
wonderfully entertaining ""The Rock,"" a film that, like this, doesn't take
itself totally seriously (sometimes this does, but then it pulls itself
right out of the ditch it creates), and features the infamous use of
hyper-hyper-editing.","The military subplot that's
thrown in is just plain ludicrous.; But at least the mediocre doomsday
script is spiced up with implausible events (such as Gatling guns) to
increase the number of booms and bangs.; What can I
say but that the laws of physics are strung up by the thumbs and
violated in the worst way, that the folks on screen are cut from
varying thicknesses and grades of cardboard, that the broad outlines of
the film are trivially predictable, that the bomb is defused/asteroid
destroyed with 3 second left on the clock, that the special effects
departments are the biggest component of the credits and that there's a
cute dog that doesn't die?; Comparatively, the space scenes are nothing special, and even border on
bland.; The wafer thin plot of Armageddon can't hold up to any scrutiny
whatsoever."
742656.0,Gilda,1997.0,"A
fascinating film for all the dark avenues it opened up sexually for
future films.; The clearest summation of the story comes in
the film's most sensational and memorable scene, as Gilda is dressed in
a tight-fitting black satin evening gown and sings 'Put the Blame on
Mame,' intoning in an erotic manner what is eating away at Johnny while
suggesting a full striptease by removing a glove.; Martel (Little Man); Runtime: 110; Columbia; 1946) A steamy noir for its time, featuring the sultry, long hair-tossing Rita
Hayworth, the hard-boiled Glenn Ford, and the sinister George Macready.; Ballin is not only the possessive type, but he's a dangerous hombre
and threatens anybody who messes with his goods.; Glenn's behavior is so
complex, that his actions toward Gilda after they marry, seem to be best
explained as a way he devised for punishing her for marrying and then
for leaving Macready.","The story is
absurd and could not be anything but risible, if if wasn't for the
bizarre performances by the stars to give it credibility.; Spoiler in the next paragraph.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; By this time Johnny realizes he
loves her and they both realize they had been stinkers as they get back
together."
746419.0,Father of the Bride,1994.0,"An enjoyable family film.; The new one has a lot of laughs and good,
old-fashioned tears, but it doesn't quite work as well as the Spencer
Tracy version.; It is still a very watchable film with legendary stars and a great
director.; The
real humanity is in the characters in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.; On the
other hand, her one-on-one basketball is one of the best scenes in the
movie and we do have some reason to think there's more to her than a
well-thumbed copy of BRIDE'S MAGAZINE.","Martin Short plays the flamboyant wedding coordinator, playing  it
as an offensive cliche with an incomprehensible and obviously synthetic
accent.; The only good thing
about Short's performance, which is blown up beyond all reason to
accommodate his presence in the movie, is that Martin's reactions are
markedly less homophobic as the wedding plans proceed and Martin becomes
reconciled to hosting the most tasteless wedding ever seen in San
Marino, California.; She has
one scene where she rather gently asserts herself, but mostly she comes
off as a money-spending machine.; George turns this
meeting into an embarrassment big enough to last a lifetime.; Steve Martin
and Diane Keaton make a likable married couple in the live-action film, but
they do not have much human complexity."
760524.0,Titanic,1994.0,"She is brilliant, even better than the outstanding DiCaprio.; Highly
Recommended.; it might not be the best movie in
the world.. but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time
spent watching it.; And yet, despite its
phoniness and brainlessness, it is still a damn good movie because it
entertains pleasantly and is beautiful to watch.; The romance between Rose and Jack
certainly evokes a passion and sense of love that is unlike most other tragic
love stories.","The result is typically a jumbled mess of 
clichés.; One can admire Cameron for making poor people
the heroes of his megabudget movie, but when the characters are 
stereotyped this baldly, he doesn't do anybody any favors.; The story is full of cliched characters, (the creepy
man who the nice girl has to marry, the poor boy with heart, the
stuck-up mother) and poor dialogue (the script consists of lots of
in-jokes of how the boat won't sink, and most of the dialogue is
pretty basic) It's a shame really, as the audience does have to sit
through 3 hours of this film.; Without good dialogue, a film could
become a very long, very boring film (like Camerons own
Terminator 2, 1992) But, luckily, there are some redeeming
features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear.; But Cameron's film is
also a serious disappointment."
771099.0,Speed,2001.0,"Jan de Bont, after spending lots of his career on
the sets of great directors, learned couple of tricks, and
it shows - SPEED is really entertaining film, full of
breathtaking stunts, explosions, chases and other
spectacular actions.; Still, there is the Keanu question, and the fortunate answer is
that Jack Traven is the perfect role for Reeves.; Well,
fortunately every so often Hollywood does come out with suspenseful
thrilling gems like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, THE FUGITIVE, and IN THE LINE
OF FIRE ... movies that have wonderful performances, believable and
engaging characters and events, and taut plot lines.; Just explosions and great visuals.; I never thought I'd be saying this, but Keanu Reeves does an
excellent job.","No plot.; No
actors.; The impression
is becoming even worse when SPEED gets compared with action
genre classics like DIE HARD or ALIENS, that could entertain
the audience for years afterwards.; Unfortunately, those qualities seem to
wear off on the second viewing, when the critical audience
becomes painfully aware of paper characters, lot of
implausibilites, lack of originality and whole series of
plot holes who could devour entire galaxies.; A psycho bomber rigs a bus full of people so that if
it falls below 50 MPH it explodes."
785641.0,Country,1995.0,"A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (1966):  This is probably my favorite of all
time.; A strong piece of human drama.; It will not be for all tastes, but it is a fine film.; Thomas More is a man of wit and brilliance and,
above all, integrity.; In the days before videotape, I had it on audiotape and played it
often once or twice a week.","the quality of these films is spotty at best.; Every month cable dredges up a bunch of older films to fill up their
programming schedules.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; The people looked the part and acted the
part.; This
month seems to have a better selection of filler films than usual."
791136.0,Bird,1998.0,"Although
lengthy, and often dwelling on the more lurid aspects
of Parker's life, it is an excellent film.; The wonderful thing about the film portrayal of Parker, and for which we
can give great thanks to director Clint Eastwood, is that these contradictions
are laid out unflinchingly.; She is the perfect wife, the
perfect mix of resignation, tolerance and exasperation.; We also hear a great deal of Parker's
sax playing.; Whitaker gives a warm and winning performance.","But this goes
too far.; And why
give Red Rodney such prominence, when Rodney was at best an occasional
collaborator?; One that
particularly annoyed me: where are the other musicians?; The story of Bird and Rodney's tour through the South, where
Rodney was billed as Albino Red to avoid redneck wrath on an integrated band,
while true, is blown way out of proportion, as Rodney himself has said.; A hornman riding ""one lousy B-flat"" with honks, grunts, exaggerated gestures
and sweat was common by the late 40s."
792101.0,Bats,1999.0,"You will find that you have inside of you more great one-line insults then
you ever imagined!; Your Comments Appreciated!; I love Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, almost as much as I love the short
story on which it is based.; Something like the underground worm
thriller `Tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements, and
in return, the film was tremendous fun.; The question
is just how, and, even if Bats doesn't hide that quite as well as, say,
Mimic does, it still manages to satisfy.","A terrible start.; Unfortunately, `Bats' is a prime example of a
formula movie done terribly, terribly wrong.; The movie falls back on every tired horror movie cliché.; The only saving grace of Bats, the
movie, is to be found in the special effects.; Playing such
characters does not help actors' careers."
798383.0,Scrapbook,2001.0,"This is a minor criticism for such an incredible first movie.; I
can't think of another film where the relationship between two brothers
brought me to tears, these being the bittersweet tears of joy.; The delightfully sunny first act turns into a powerful second act that
delves deeply into the true meaning of the love and responsibilities of
brotherhood.; It presents real adolescence, warts and all,
and that is what touches you deeply.; Although it does sometimes feel rather like an after-school special, the
movie reduced me to tears on many occasions as it considers genuine
subjects -- the joy of young love, what it means to be a brother,
falling into the wrong crowd -- that most movies reduce to clichés.","""Excuse me,
they're legally challenged?""; At one point I got really angry at the movie, but then I realized that
my anger was misplaced.; It is not yet rated but will
probably be an R for some normal high school profanity, a little
violence and mature themes.; SCRAPBOOK runs a little too long at 1:50.; In SCRAPBOOK, Curt Martin, a shy high school kid with average looks and
with a popular, older, high school brother, has recently won the lead in
the big school play."
799801.0,Psycho,1987.0,"If the first
version had been destroyed, this might make more sense, but it's still around
and it's still a great film.; Although this new, ""Psycho,"" is, in my mind, the best horror film of the 
year, I have a feeling that most people unfamiliar with the original 
will not like it very much.; Chad Everett is hilarious as the lecherous Texan businessman.; I don't know if it was the black-and-white or the fact that I had
never seen the movie before, the first time I saw this movie it was much
more exciting.; This is one of the most
recognized and best film scores of all time.","It is then a big disappointment that Vince Vaughn is terribly
miscast.; Why is Arbogast wearing such a ridiculous hat?; Now I
wonder why I paid money to go in the theater to watch a mildly
entertaining imitation rather than stayed at home and watched ""Vertigo,""
or something.; The marvelous cast on hand is a complete waste of time and
talent.; His obvious talent aside, Vaughn was
simply miscast."
811864.0,Clean Slate,1999.0,"The greatest is probably the  
performance of Carvey, in a role analagous in many ways to Bill Murray's  
in GROUNDHOG DAY.; Young people may grow up quickly in today's complicated world, but
still they seem to want pop heroes who are in perpetual childhood.; CLEAN SLATE is that rare comedy which simply never goes  
exactly where you expect it to go.; So it qualifies as one of the most  
unexpected surprises of the year that CLEAN SLATE turns out to be an  
absolutely delightful comedy.; The cast is solid.","It's also problematic personally, as he seems to  
be involved with at least two women, one of whom (Valeria Golino) is  
supposed to be dead.; For all its promise and 
possibilities, this film manages to be nothing more than forgettable.; One of the most disappointing things about this film is that it could 
have been so much better, either as a mystery or a comedy.; His  
""Saturday Night Live"" characters were usually caricatures, and the  
WAYNE'S WORLD films and the horrible OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS simply  
regurgitated those characters.; Yet, mysteriously, 
the result is a unsatisfying mix of a hard-to-swallow gumshoe tale and a 
pedestrian comedy."
820912.0,Persuasion,2000.0,"I can not use it here as it gives away a
key fact, but it is a perfect statement to his obliviousness and an
excellent end to the story.; And, at a time when most love stories involve
copious displays of skin, it's a rare pleasure to see so much emotion
brought to the screen by a single kiss.; She says, ""You presume
to know me"", and he replies, ""In my heart I know you intimately.""; Daly's technique of shooting indoor
scenes closer up than normal gives an intimacy and presence that I have
not seen before.; Distributor: Sony Pictures Classics Jane Austen, considered by many literary critics to be among the
first of the ""modern"" writers, is perhaps best known for creating
believable, strong-willed, independent female characters in an era when
women in books were often little more than window dressing or plot
devices.","There is not even a mediocre
performance.; Some fun costumes might have helped ease the pain of sitting
through PERSUASION, considering that all these dull people do is talk
and eat.; Full of performances that could have been
done better by hand puppets, sloppy direction, and a script that's
nearly impossible to follow, PERSUASION has very little to redeem it.; I don't think so, seeing how she spends the entire film
just gawking at things like a wide-eyed Chihuahua and then whining
about them.; Instead, to break up the monotony of the
cramped sitting room settings, director Roger Michell opted for totally
inappropriate MTV-style moving camerawork to capture the sheer nothing
that is going on."
828220.0,Fallout,1963.0,"For three quarters of the 
film, Palumbo does an excellent job exploring the issue.; There's a concern about 
sanitation and privacy -- facets of human existence we rarely consider 
in our day-to-day lives.; With no food 
available, the characters' energy level is low, and this adds to the 
ominous sense of claustrophobia -- an atmosphere that becomes 
increasingly pervasive as the drama and tension build in tandem.; Palumbo pays careful attention to fine detail.; He's focused on these 
people as they are now, in the bunker.","One of FALLOUT's few failings is a too-facile ending.; Another is 
the lack of character depth.; With a shooting budget of $90,000, 
Palumbo couldn't film a disaster movie, so he did his best to simulate 
the catastrophe with sound effects, smoke, and fire.; Divorced?; This film could be considered a thriller or a drama -- either is 
applicable."
831446.0,Paradise Road,1999.0,"And, while one of PARADISE ROAD's themes is the barbarity of 
war, it manages to present its case without demonizing the Japanese 
(indeed, it goes to great pains to paint a few of them as sympathetic).; Frances McDormand, who has a remarkable ability to take on
extraordinarily different characters plays Dr Verstak, a German Jew, who in
McDormands unique style is somewhat odd, but quite charismatic.; Yet, even though PARADISE 
ROAD is ultimately about the triumph over adversity, the script never 
forgets that for everyone who overcomes seemingly-impossible obstacles, 
there are many who stumble along the way, never to rise again.; Paradise Road is based on the true story of a group of women and children
who were captured and taken to a Japanese POW camp after swimming to the
shores of Sumatra from their sinking ship.; For the women in this film paradise is freedom, and the road to freedom is
a long and arduous one along which many will fall.","The screen
adaptation suffers from the lack of any narrative drive.; The story is true and the
actresses are appealing and neither of these is a reason to recommend
this exceptionally uninteresting movie.; PARADISE ROAD gets my vote for Most Boring Movie of the Year.; And Francis McDormand speaks in a campy
German accent.; However, apart from those stated 
similarities, there's little to connect the two films."
839860.0,Jeepers Creepers,1996.0,"One of the things that makes Joy Ride so enjoyable is the fact you never see
the bad guy.; Jeepers Creepers is a functional, crafty, genuinely
scary little chiller that delivers exactly what it
promises and more.; Gina Philips and Justin Long create credible teenagers facing an
unknowing, evil force.; But
that is part of the fun of ""Jeepers Creepers"" - its vagueness supplies the
chills, especially in the final, haunting shot.; Sure, my proposal is overly reliant on luck and good timing, but
compared to what is presented onscreen, it is pure genius.","The story is banal enough, with decent performers
like Selma Blair (""Cruel Intentions"") and Max Beesley (""The Last
Minute"") unable to do much with a script devoid of wit to say
nothing of credibility.; But director Dana Lustig makes matters
worse with some film-school, music-video jump cuts, excessive
use of a blue filter at one point during a car chase, and generic,
intrusive rock music.; Rated R.  Running time: 89 minutes.; After all, even a pretty
woman like Shawn can't bear to live without this jerk, and despite
her knockout of a figure and her tasteful, black, urban threads,
she sees no prospect of something better.; Creepers' first half is very promising, but then writer/director/child
molester Victor Salva (Powder) starts in with the typical horror clichés."
858457.0,Drinking Games,2000.0,"Dinah Leffert, who plays the 
sexually voracious Whitney, is especially noteworthy.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.; The six friends -- Noah (Christian Leffler), Whitney (Dinah 
Leffert), Scott (Geoffrey Smith), JC (Brian Anthony), Alex (Melanie 
Koch), and Heather (Andrea White) -- gather following the funeral of 
Tara, a member of their inner circle who recently committed suicide.","It's all pretty 
routine and predictable -- writer/director Joseph Lawson never attempts 
anything daring or original.; Few of the conversations are

Cinematography: Marc Greenfield DRINKING GAMES is an uninspired, often-insipid Generation X version 
of THE BIG CHILL.; From start to finish, this 
movie is derivative.; We're a fly on the wall, watching these people as they 
drink themselves into oblivion as a balm to their grief, but we never 
get a sense of any genuine personalities beneath all the dialogue."
861047.0,While You Were Sleeping,2000.0,"I recommend it very highly.; I recommend it very highly.; Peter Boyle is
terrific as the family patriarch (affectionately referred to as ""Ox"" in
the film) with Glynis Johns and Micole Mercurio also good as the
grandmother and mother.; Peter Boyle is
terrific as the family patriarch (affectionately referred to as ""Ox"" in
the film) with Glynis Johns and Micole Mercurio also good as the
grandmother and mother.; The best
romantic comedies strike a delicate balance between complicated
situations that border on fantasy and believable characters that seem
like real people.","Or is this just a
bad idea altogether and should she somehow try to marry Peter?; I found myself wondering however
why they released what was clearly a Christmas movie in April.; It's
predictable at best and just plain dull most of the time, focusing ad
nauseam on Lucy's moral dilemma about whether or not to end her charade.; Peter's dysfunctional family is good for a few laughs, but otherwise I
barely cracked a smile.; Peter Gallagher ends up playing
Peter as mostly befuddled, and not very interesting."
878402.0,Nightwatch,1997.0,"I also liked the way
the film handled the key turning in the actual morgue part of the
morgue: it's chilling in a simplisitc, human way.; This is the best scene in the film, due
mostly in part to Chapman, whose worldweariness is immensely appealing
and totally fascinating.; A real nice touch.; It's all terribly corny, but it sets up a nice tone that should have
preceded, and it gets us thinking about who will be the notorious killer
amongst them.; Looking back at the same trailer, it still looks cool, because it's not
another subconcious ""Scream"" film, but rather an actual serious
thriller, with shots and scenes where you actually hold your breath in
fear, and are stuck in the middle of a mystery.","It also doesn't help that the characters are disturbingly boring and
one-dimensional, and the acting, for the most part, is piss-poor (you
heard me).; Anyone hoping for some quality entertainment will 
realize that this is not a good sign.; If not for 
Bornedal's stylish approach to the material and a couple of effectively 
chilling sequences, NIGHTWATCH would have been a complete waste of time 
and effort.; The only regrets I have is, watching talents like Patricia Arquette and
Ewan McGregor wasted on such poor material.; And Arquette is the worst: I'm not a
big fan of hers (I liked her a lot in ""True Romance,"" though), and if
anyone ever wanted to challenge me on that notion, I can now cheerfully
point to her cliched and eyes-rolling performance in this film as proof
that, yes, she can really blow as an actress (Exhibit Two is her
embarrassingly overrated performance in ""Lost Highway"")."
889692.0,Blue Sky,1969.0,"The plus side of BLUE SKY is that both principals have roles in
with which they have not been previously associated.; - James Berardinelli (blake7@cc.bellcore.com) The review above was posted to the
rec.arts.movies.reviews newsgroup (de.rec.film.kritiken for German reviews).; Jones as a reserved husband dedicated to both his work and his family,
is a switch from the intense obsessive character he was in The
Fugitive.; One
moment she is Bardot, another she is Hayworth.; Set in the early Sixties, BLUE SKY approaches the issue of
underground nuclear testing and fallout as if it was a timely subject
for today.","Powers Boothe, playing a
stereotyped nasty commanding officer with an inflexible mindset, is
lifeless.; BLUE SKY is a dreary, disjointed affair that tries to tie together
an anti-nuclear message with a family-in-crisis melodrama.; Despite being one of several obvious villains, his Vince
Johnson is too dull to actively dislike.; Had the story been compelling, the approach might have
worked, but this part of the tale--about a United States Army officer
with a conscience (Major Hank Marshall, played by Tommy Lee Jones)--is
heavyhanded, contrived, and cliched.; Maybe it's the character, but there isn't much here for
the audience to latch on to or care about."
896405.0,Aparajito,1995.0,"Highly recommended.; Ray has crafted another masterpiece which captures
the drama of the human condition in a simple story.; The soberness of the story is
tempered with small nuggets of simple humor.; It continues the
saga of the trilogy, but it also explores somewhat different themes.; APARAJITO is an amazing motion picture.","While watching this film, who doesn't nod 
knowingly when Sarbojaya carefully packs Apu's suitcase before his trip, 
adding a jar of home made butter and pleading with him to write soon?; The only constant is 
Sarbojaya; even Apu undergoes a visible metamorphosis as the younger 
actor gives way to the older one.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

897620.0,Ghost,1999.0,"All in all, though, this was an entertaining movie that makes me
miss movies about people and the connections between them.; A character actor who played one of the patients
in Cuckoo's Nest and one of Salieri's servants in Amadeus gives a great
performance of a ghost trapped in the New York subway.; But, you will see a movie
that is a wonderful blend of love story, thriller, and comedy.; In desperation, Sam goes to the storefront business of Oda Mae
(Whoopi Goldberg), a con artist whose latest con is spiritual advising.; The humor works.","The director and film editor should have shaven about 10-20
minutes from the movie, and would have made a better, tighter movie.; No, you will *not* believe in ghosts after seeing GHOST, unless you
were predisposed to believe in them already.; Floors seem to
stop you but, hey, who wants to invest in a film about a dead bank executive
falling to the center of the earth, right?; However, I'm not
convinced that it was necessary to show us the difference between being
sucked up by good ghosts vs. bad ghosts; it looked downright corny to
me.; GHOST is not really very good as a ghost story."
899946.0,Caveman,1989.0,"It's a good film for a group of 
young children to watch (one word may need to be bleeped) because its 
wordless presentation is bound to get them explaining the subtleties of the 
storyline to each other.; In CAVEMAN, Ringo's doleful expression and 
shambling  posture win us over from the start (I'm sure many a critic 
remarked at the time that the ex-Beatle's best acting performance to date 
didn't require him to speak).; One of my 
favorite moments occurs when Ringo and friend Dennis Quaid simultaneously 
'learn' to walk erect and then immediately shrug off thoughts of returning 
to their less evolved former tribe leader.; Together they form their own tribe of 
outsiders.; Dissatisfied with 
life in the tribe - and frustrated by his desire for Tonda's mate Lana 
(Barbara Bach, looking very sexy in furs) - he sets off on his own and 
gradually meets other loners.","Traditionally, in most 'serious' movies of this genre, a 
supposed misfit is ejected from the tribe and is eventually adopted into a 
more enlightened tribal society.; By no means are you expected to draw any serious subtexts 
from these scenes - the group's accidental discoveries are played for 
laughs, though do get a little predictable after a while.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film
that lacks originality, believable characters and situations
and actually represents anything that gave B-films a bad
name.; Unfortunately, he appears in
this film too little too late to prevent viewers from
realising why Tonya Harding's silver screen debut proved to
be her last film.; Terri Thompson being the actual star of the film instead of
Tonya Harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes
that feature former figure skater.; Martin Sheen's brother Joe Estevez, whose character
looks like he had entered from another movies' set, is the
only bright spot of BREAKAWAY.; Face of Tonya Harding is most prominently featured on
movie's poster, but the main star of the film is Terri
Thompson who plays Myra, attractive woman who works as a
courier for gangster."
940164.0,Boogie Nights,2001.0,"And the film is very funny, with several great scenes throughout that
are laugh-out-loud hilarious.; Burt Reynolds is brilliant, Julianne
Moore shows real emotion, and William H. Macy is great aswell
(but he always is.); Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's wildly entertaining epic captures 
the late 70s/early 80s era in all its tacky glory, with terrific 
performances from a large ensemble cast.; The conversation between Dirk and
Amber at this moment is truly hilarious, and also makes us realize
that sexual pleasure is more like this (""Does it feel good?""); Boogie Nights is an excellent film.","Too many
characters are too much alike, and most of them are too shallow to merit any
screen time at all.; There are scenes where the cast is involved in filming the porno scenes 
where their acting is extremely bad and for good actors to act bad when they're 
supposed to adds a dimension of talented creativity.; I got the feeling that itUs 2 1/2 hour running time could have 
been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance.; Don't get me wrong -- there's much
rich material within its long running time of 150 minutes-plus, but it's
being dazzlingly overrated.; Also hilarious are the porn
sequences; the wafer-thin premises, lame dialogue, flaccid line readings,
cheap production values, suggestive character names--all of the most minute
details are paid attention to."
942012.0,Before Night Falls,1999.0,"Schnabel also makes great use of music in lieu
of dialogue in several scenes.; ""Before Night Falls"" is hopeful tragedy that shows the strength of the
human spirit under adversity.; Falls is beautifully shot and exceptionally well
put together, with Schnabel using numerous cinematic techniques, usually
to perfection.; What we are left with are some wonderful images and a terrific and 
eclectic score that includes the adagio from Mahler's 5th -- always a 
good choice.; It's got that certain ""art-house"" feel about it and been
highly praised my many among that group.","Listen, I don't mind a
good artsy-fartsy flick every now and again either, but this one just didn't
offer me much to work with.; A
pretty big bore.; In fact, here's an example of one of the things
which simply didn't work for me in this film.; Over two hours, and not much
new or interesting to say within.; His lack of energy

forgettable 4 with an admirable, if heavy-handed, environmentalist
message about the questionable advances of progress.; I'm usually impressed by Showtime's made-for-television movies

keep them from meeting.; It is an interesting film,
with a strong cast and competent direction.; Why isn't this a great movie?","Why is Boyer doing these terrible things to Bergman?; The audience spends most of the film puzzled.; Bergman and

1014566.0,Bruiser,1975.0,"And, like anyone who lets people wipe their feet on his back, Henry's
life is full of people who take advantage of him.; George A. Romero, the writer/director credited with ushering in the
modern horror film era with 1968's Night of the Living Dead, brings his
latest film to Rochester this Saturday as part of the Dryden Theater's
continuous `Visiting Filmmaker' series.; Speaking of over-the-top, that's just what Stormare is in his role.; All Rights Reserved.; Please direct comments/criticisms of the review to relevant newsgroups.","Other than Stormare and Garbiras, who gets naked a bunch of times, the
rest of the actors are as bland as Henry's character is supposed to be.; When he gets his at the end, it's a huge letdown,
considering how despicable the character was.; And, worst of all, his bigoted, ass-grabbing, cock-waggling boss (Peter
Stormare, Chocolat) belittles Henry in front of his colleagues and seems
a little too familiar with Janine.; Bruiser, full of Romero's
trademark humor and lower-than-low budget for acting talent, is an
interesting but gimmicky parable that is more remarkable for its
similarity to two recent films than anything else.; He's
practically invisible and lacks the backbone to stand up to anybody who
gets in his face or questions his opinions."
1016946.0,Visions of Murder,1991.0,"The national video distributor in my country was extremely
creative in editing various clips from the film and using
appropriate music, thus making VISIONS OF MURDER look like
an exciting blend of supernatural horror and psychological
thriller.; Jesse Newman reports it to the police, but soon she becomes
the prime suspect in the murder investigation.; What makes those film good are
the script, the direction and actors.; Review written on September 11th 1999 The review above was posted to the

interesting only as an example how bad movies could be sold
to unsuspecting audience.; The characters
are uninteresting and are played by disinterested actors.; VISIONS OF MURDERS
fails in all of that.; Of course, in reality, VISIONS OF MURDER was
nothing more than conventional product of American TV
industry.; Barbara Eden practically destroys her character, but the
worst disappointment is in the form of Terry O'Quinn, who
sleepwalks through the role very similar to the one he had
brilliantly played in THE STEPFATHER."
1021748.0,Dragonheart,2000.0,"**** = Excellent.; Notice especially how realistic his teeth are.; It's a tale of the old ways - the
days of King Arthur - the struggle for power and glory while still
attaining those now ancient respects.; Connery hams it up a
little as the dragon, but that is perhaps what is necessary to render
him so delightfully in to the form of the great beast.; The ending is well done.","The last five minutes of this movie are the worst, with
some silly celestial nonsense that would be laughed out of any
planetarium light show, much less a summer movie.; This
is not a bad film; it is just a disappointing one.; The really dumb script just
kills this picture.; Not a good thing.; Sad to say, that there
is not much else worthwhile in the picture."
1023122.0,Steppenwolf,1994.0,"And then it concentrates on the voyages of the main
character, from his drug intervals, to his involvement with a woman who is
bisexual, and not specially in love with him ( very German if you ask me )
but likes the mind of the man who trips so much.; Fred Haines' film version of this very famous novel is not going to satisfy
everyone, but it should give a good example of what Herman Hesse was all
about, and the main ideas of the novel come through very well, specially
when it is set up by the thinking mind of the main character, played by the
veteran actor extraordinaire Max Von Sydow.; With the exception of the MAGIC THEATRE sequences, which I wish were more a
part of the novel than the film, this story is good, while it isn't as
interesting as the novel itself.; In the book, we get a feeling  that the
writer is going to continue, and will survive the forays into unknown spaces
of the mind and body.; But it would
make an excellent film if the persons involved believe in the work and the
process which the characters go through in it.","Herman Hesse's STEPPENWOLF, is not a good subject for a film.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

excellent performance as Margaret, bringing to it inimitable comic timing

depths of despair as when she decides that she doesn't want to die, 
after all.; From its tantaliser of an opening, FAITHFUL

but I didn't.; I just didn't see any
consistent characterizations; transformations came at will, with no
justification.; Or the constant rehashing of the 'faithfulness' theme--why
can't men be faithful, why women shouldn't bother to be faithful--which
gets to be about as annoying as a fly buzzing about your head.; Worse of the lot are the cheesy slow-mo shots of
Jack's mistress sashaying about.; The biggest culprit of the 'trying-too-hard' syndrome is the movie's
attempt to moralize, it's insistence on Making A Point."
1031617.0,Oscar,1996.0,"OSCAR makes it as one
of the funniest comedies in a long time.; It helps that we also introduced to two amusing Italian
tailors, Ferrero and Shearer, and to the very funny and timid
Tim Curry who plays Snaps's  elocution teacher and ends up
marrying Lisa.; It is not
only a very funny comedy, but it is a comedy unlike comedies that have been
made for many years.; Would you believe Sylvester Stallone in a non-violent comedy?; Music, Elmer Bernstein.","But
surely now he realizes that he cannot keep playing low-personality action
figures on the screen.; The actors mug with huge gesticulations,
as if parodying  a bad silent movie.; By an amusing coincidence, in the title role of ""Bugsy,""
another 1991 movie, gangster Warren Beatty too practices
quotidian enrichment of his vocabulary).; Its American adapters did nicely too, except for some unfunny
excesses, e.g.; Almost
undoubtedly this scene was written just for the film, since it is poorly
written and it does not take place in the Provolone house, as most of the
rest of the film does."
1049312.0,Mr. Saturday Night,1992.0,"Yet, Crystal's Buddy is both a
composite and a comic in his own right.; Equally true-to-life is Buddy's repertory, strong on
insults but cautious on political issues.; Yet on those occasions the film manages sometimes to
transcend the tacky and the crude, and can introduce bittersweet moments of
true pathos.; Mostly though,
it shows with sharp realism the perpetual insecurity of showbiz people,
even at the height of their reputation.; Above all, the movie works in, as its second major, as well as most
original element, the Buddy-Stan relationship, ambiguous yet clear, built
on  narcissism and monstrous insensitivity on one side, antagonism,
devotion and frustration on the other, and a weird kind of love under the
surface.","You really wonder why his wife
never left him because there is just nothing affectionate or warm about
the guy, and why his brother never walked out on him after being Buddy's
constant target of sarcastic abuse filled with meanness for all these
years.; Otherwise, after a hilarious opening scene in a family living
room, the movie just drags (I looked at my watch 3 times :-)).; (The imitation of a reporter in a basketball locker
room was a riot!); As Stan, David Paymer quietly steals every scene he appears in.; And since movies cannot let go of the
odd notion that performers, whether young or old, deserve more pathos and
sympathy than anyone else, ""Mr. Saturday Night"" too oversentimentalizes the
actors and the showbiz profession."
1049923.0,Mephisto,1998.0,"However, MEFISTO
is still a very good film with a intriguing and disturbing
message that is relevant even for our, seemingly
non-totalitarian times.; This excellent psychological and sociological study of
conformism couldn't have been made without Klaus Maria
Brandauer, German stage actor who seemed perfect for this
complex and very demanding role.; Brandauer had the good fortune of being together with truly
stellar cast, although some of them, like Andrzej Wajda's
long-time associate Krystina Janda had to settle for minor
and somewhat undeserving role.; His career would reach new peak when he astounds
everyone with his brilliant performance as Mephisto in stage
version of Goethe's ""Faust"".; The other choice was to emigrate
and enjoy freedom beyond borders of their homeland, but the
price for that freedom was unemployment, poverty and
anonimity in countries that didn't share their language -
the most important tool of the acting trade.","The ending also seems
forced, confusing and somewhat too ""artsy"".; Although such notions can be best explained by
envy or old irrational Balkans hatreds, they have some merit
- horrors of history simply can't be explained by couple of
psychotic, evil or scruples individuals who took reign at
the wrong place and in the wrong time.; Leaders who conducted
genocide, ethnic cleansing or waged aggressive wars would
have been powerless without plenty of individuals willing to
support or carry out their policies.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; This new
development wasn't exactly welcomed by Serbia's neighbours,
where people claim that the fall of one man can't redeem the
crimes of millions who had directly or indirectly supported
his policies."
1058644.0,Deep Rising,2000.0,"But it's still a good
satire.; I
recommend it highly.; Luckily , it's a very good B
movie.; I'm happy to say that everyone else fares a bit better in the film,
especially Treat Williams and Framke Janssen.; All in all it the most satisfactory
flick of its genre to come by in many a month and perhaps in years, the
Alien series not excluded.","An overly disappointing effort overall.; Another tiresome cliche.; On the plus side, however, the film's closing image shows some promise
for a potentially interesting (but unlikely) sequel.; Deep Rising is not a horrible movie but at points it's a painful movie.; It's annoying on some
level, but wait a second... ...is this a spoof?"
1065821.0,Clerks,1999.0,"Yes, it is raw but also hysterical, deep and
truthful.; In fact some of my favorite
movies are SHERMAN'S MARCH, ALWAYS: BUT NOT NECESSARILY FOREVER, MY
DINNER WITH ANDRE, 35 UP, EATING RAOUL, and HOUSE OF GAMES--which all
qualify as very strange and off-beat.; I am of course describing the incredibly funny debut of director Kevin Smith,
known as ""Clerks,"" a hilarious, obscene and unpredictable comedy that is
something of a classic in its genre.; In Clerks they have a perfectly funny
chemistry, and deliver this movie home.; Made on the very meager budget of under $30,000, by a dropout from
film school, CLERKS is one of the funniest, good-natured and vocally
raunchy movie in a long, long while.","The frequent use of 'chapter' titles like ""Perspicacity"" and ""Malaise"" 
is particularly annoying, being both pointless and unfunny, as is a 
recurring joke about shoe polish.; I am not even supposed to be
here today!""; Technically it is a poor piece of animation.; If so, punch your clock, and spend an entertainingly annoying day
with Dante Hicks: convenience-store operative, sans elegance.; The film as a whole is too contrived for my taste."
1083433.0,I Know What You Did Last Summer,,"In the main roles, Hewitt and Gellar are highly talented, and Hewitt, 
especially, is one of the best screamers I've ever heard.; Perhaps the best character is that of Missy Egan (Anne Heche), a lonely 
backwoods woman whose brother was the one Julie thinks they hit.; Cast: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, 
Freddie Prinze Jr., Bridgette Wilson, Anne Heche, Johnny Galecki, Muse 
Watson.; And last, the film 
creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most 
memorable I've seen in a horror movie, particularly the suspenseful, 
superbly shot sequence involving Helen at her family's store with the 
killer inside with her.; The very last scene of the film, although the most predictable,
manages to be the scariest.","Actually, that isn't
even close to the worst.; Prinze Jr. gives a performance to be desired 
here, and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth.; Hers is the only performance in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID
LAST SUMMER with any depth.; In a scene lifted straight out of SCREAM -- they share the
same screenwriter, Kevin Williamson -- the kids try to out-scare each
other with diabolical stories.; John Debney's heavy music overwhelms every scene with reminders to
be frightened."
1114222.0,Eraser,1991.0,"Thanks to an excellent script by Tony Puryear and Walon Green, the
movie is the funniest action picture this year.; Very funny.; **** Amazing, potent stuff.; **** Amazing, potent stuff.; The one-liners (Arnold's trademark) were fast and funny,
the action was the best of any Schwarzennegar film in history, and
Pastorelli was great as the Mafioso- witness who was helped by
Schwarzennegar in the beginning of the film, providing even more comic
relief.","Is it just me, or is Arnold Schwarzenegger's accent getting worse?; The plane sequence would've been laughable with any other
actor in the role, but its Arnold, so I began to think Arnold should
pick on someone, or something his own size.; Worse than Twister,
worse than Mission Implausible.; In the film, Arnold comes off as a complete idiot who couldn't
protect his lunch money without blurting out where it is.; It was horrible."
1116291.0,James and the Giant Peach,1996.0,"Amazing.; While the film isn't 
quite as accomplished as a TOY STORY or a BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, it's 
still worth a trip to the theater, especially for those who enjoy things 
that are a little unconventional.; Jeffrey and his
friend Sam, both almost 7, both liked the film and were never scared.; Inside he meets a great bunch of bugs.; Here, as in THE WIZARD OF
OZ, the show begins and ends in a more traditional present.","Unfortunately, the film makers have decided to include several 
completely forgettable musical numbers penned by Randy Newman.; His awkward, loud Brooklyn 
accent could have been done better by any number of actors and come off 
as less annoying.; This film lacks that vision, and seems to show us a
kinder, gentler Burton - a well-adjusted, but boring Burton.; Too
bad the story drags.; Where it falls down is in trying to make the live-action 
setting recall the stop-motion setting."
1125824.0,Deliverance,1997.0,"But by today's film
standards and in today's world, such scenes as the one in DELIVERANCE can
be reproduced in a way that isn't as shocking, although they can be even
more graphic (e.g.; DELIVERANCE is definitely a wild ride (oops, I'm doing it again).; Although when compared
to today's, it may seem rather conservative.; It's definitely one of
those ""must see"" movies and should be considered one of the classics of
its decade.; Its scenery
needs to be fully enjoyed to appreciate the entire film and
'Deliverance' is about as realistic a picture as any I have ever seen.","For the time this scene must have seemed very shocking, but now it just
seems antiquated.; That's when you get to 
thinking maybe the rest of the movie will have the other three trying 
to escape a psycho Reynolds and his even nuttier hairpiece, but after 
the big rape scene and Reynolds' getting shot, he drops out of the 
movie.; Here's a movie 
that takes almost forty-five minutes to get to one exciting scene and 
then spends the rest of the movie coming down from that.; The rest of the time it hovers 
somewhere between two-and-a-half and three-star status.; A few people have told me I don't like 
these movies because I'm watching them now, as opposed to forty 
years ago, when they didn't seem so stilted and cheesy."
1126228.0,Black and White,1990.0,"Both films were eventually cut to receive a more marketable R rating, 
but each one is crafted with the skill of a filmmaker unafraid of taking 
risks.; This is a 
director with a unique vision.; With such a maddeningly large array of themes and subjects,
it's mighty impressive that Black and White works as well as it does.; The world is that of the gangsta rappers, the ghetto boys, and
the thug-life advocators that dominate the world of hip-hop and rap
music.; It doesn't feel like we're watching a documentary but
rather a movie that genuinely reflects real life.","* - One of the worst movies ever made.; * * - Pretty bad, see it only if you have nothing better to do.; One, half the dialogue is completely unintelligble.; It 
is supposed to be an opus about race relations in New York City, but 
ultimately, the film is as inconsequential as any one of the 
underdeveloped caricatures that this ensemble cast attempts to animate.; Robert Downey Jr. (the
horrendous ""Two Girls and a Guy"") plays a gay man, who I believe was
intended to be humorous but was simply vulgar instead."
1127648.0,Bonjour tristesse,1999.0,"However, although such
experiments fail, BONJOUR TRISTESSE is still very good film
to watch - Hollywood soap opera at its best, nicely done and
still entertaining after many decades.; Her
animosity towards Anne would lead her to conduct romantic
intrigue with unexpected consequences.; Cecile at first doesn't mind, but when Anne begins
establishing her control over Raymond and endangering
Cecile's carefree lifestyle, she becomes jealous.; BONJOUR TRISTESSE is nicely photographed, features
good costumes, pretty locations of French Riviera and nice
musical score by Gabriel Auric (although the title theme,
sung by Juliette Greco, seems somewhat overplayed).; Accustomed to all kinds of luxury, Cecile not only
approves, but also actually encourages Raymond's decadent
lifestyle that involves constant womanising.","The plot of this film, as well as its setting - closed
circle of idle rich people whose lives are one big endless
party - is hardly original, and it was used in thousands of
soap operas.; Even
Mylene Demongeot brings some texture and charm to terribly
stereotypical role of brainless bimbo.; These days teenagers are supposed to get famous by making
successful careers as pop singers, actors or fashion models
or, if everything else fails, by gunning down their
classmates.; Director Otto Preminger was quite aware of the
shallowness of content, and tried his best to mimic it with
style.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
1137966.0,Our Song,1983.0,"If you dug American High, the canceled high-school-based reality show
recently brought back to life by PBS, you should definitely check out Jim
McKay's Our Song, a gritty but fictitious look at the lives of three young
girls and how they spent their summer.; Bammer's Bottom Line:
This summer brings an interesting, stark contrast of Life In The Hood
from the cameras of two directors: John Singleton's larger-than-life,
death-waiting-on-every-corner BABY BOY, and Jim McKay's slice-of-life
OUR SONG.; In any case, the lasting impact of OUR SONG is that it is an Everyman's
film, about the everyday life of young folks in a particular corner of
the world.; They're good kids, for the most part, which
is part of the film's offbeat realism.; Washington, Martinez, and Simpson are definitely
worth looking for in the future; I just hope that Mainstream Hollywood
doesn't lock them into dead-end Welfare Mama/Crackhead ""NYPD-Blue""-type
roles - but you'll notice I'm not holding my breath.","But, like the rest of OUR SONG, it just doesn't resonate
because we never believe that the girls mean anything that they say.; The lack of Big!; The scene ends as one girl throws out a line
about how it would be a relief to be shot dead.; You might expect that the band would at
least form a significant subtheme since it gets a lot of screen time, but it
doesn't.; I'm happy to note, though, that I wasn't wrong about the way the
remake of ""Ooh Child"" would continually be used throughout the movie."
1138987.0,Fatherland,1992.0,"On one hand, the created worlds are so
different from the world we live in, and on the other hand,
they are in the same time closer and more recognisable than
fantastic worlds of distant galaxies or distant futures.; The
world of FATHERLAND, although some may question its
plausibility (most of the today's historians are almost
unanimous in their opinion that Hitler could never win WW2,
at least not in the way indicated in the film), is very
realistic one.; The most intriguing idea is to show the most
evil and universally despised political system in the world
- German Nazism - slowly evolving into its ""gentler and
kinder"" form, in a manner very similar to the path Soviet
Union took from Stalin to Gorbachev era.; The
summit in Berlin is set, and among many invited journalists
is Charlie Maguire (played by Miranda Richardson).; The entire concept of alternative history is really
fascinating.","Instead of
putting an effort to show the fascinating and intriguing
details of Robert Harris' world, screenplay by Ron
Hutchinson and Stanley Weiser concentrated almost
exclusively on the lame, predictable and boring crime
investigation.; The rest is one great disappointment - one of the
most tragic examples of great movies ideas being wasted in
mediocre screen effort.; Things are even made
worse with the poorly drawn characters, and actors who don't
put much effort in playing, which is especially the case
with Rutger Hauer.; Unfortunately, like many good novels, FATHERLAND suffered a
terrible fate in its version as feature film.; Director Menaul put some real effort in
portraying some interesting details while portraying Robert
Harris' world (like the posters of ""Die Beatles"" band)."
1141932.0,Blue,1997.0,"I highly recommend DAMNED IN THE USA--for a good night of
enlightenment--and laughter.; It's also an explicit movie.; This is a movie for people that are against censorship.; Not only does DAMNED IN THE USA provide enough
material to make the viewer think about censorship, it also has many
hilarious moments, some from the stand-up schtick running throughout,
and some from the way people like Reverend Wildmon tries to explain the
Mapplethorpe phots (""He had his er ... um ... up the other man's ...
er ... um.."") DAMNED IN THE USA uses many methods to make it's anti-censorship
points.; What makes DAMNED so intriguing is that it is a movie about
censorship--that was itself censored.","However, the movie gets away with it, as it is obviously meant to
be satirical, and not exploitive.; When one first hears this, they begin to
think ""Oh--I see--the whole idea of the movie is to show all that
naughty stuff"".; Someone who is for censorship -
will find this movie offensive.; One of the main methods is by actually showing the audience
what is/was being censored.; It shows the insides of the porno
magazines, also, the interview with the 60's porn queen is over what
seems to be an actual porno movie--with all the explicity therein."
1162097.0,Don't Lose Your Head,1994.0,"Other acting honours 
go to Joan Sims who is perfect as Desiree and Charles Hawtrey who is 
excellent as the French aristo Pommfrit.; Definitely one of the best of the series and a 
joy to watch.; Sid James is 
excellent as the English fop and Black Fingernail, Kenneth Williams 
excels as the evil Camembert, and Peter Butterworth expertly plays the 
substantial part of Camembert's thick-witted crony.; A more complex story than most Carry Ons, this film enjoys good 
production values (sets, costumes) and an on-form cast.; Jacqueline is imprisoned in the Bastille and Camembert, his love 
Desiree Dubarry (Joan Sims), and Bidet all travel to London in pursuit of 
the Fingernail.","Ffing becomes known as 'The Black Fingernail' because 
he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up, one 
with a black fingernail.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion."
1209086.0,Cuba,1999.0,"His main hero, Major Dapes (Connery) is a professional soldier who very
unprofessionally turns against its employers, but he is basically a nice
guy.; It was a country based on compromise between
East and West, and in good old days of the Cold War it presented some kind
of interesting mixing of opposing ideologies, allowing its government and
people to thrive.; CUBA, Richard Lester's movie dealing with Cuban Revolution, was on the
programme of Belgrade Film Festival in the early 1980s.; Alejandra Pullido (Adams), factory owner, is a bitch towards the
workers, but she is basically a nice girl.; Fidelistas sometimes
machinegun down dozens of innocent people, but they are basically nice guys
etc.","There are too many examples of Lester trying to be nice to too much people.; Other actors, playing NASHVILLE-like episodes, contribute a lot, making this
bore of a movie at least watchable.; Acting is, however, nice.; Jack
Weston, on the other hand, is wasted as comic relief.; In order to make things worse, the end scene is one
of thousands of CASABLANCA rip-offs."
1214795.0,Angel Baby,1997.0,"This is a sensitive film.; Harry is played with sincere and touching emotions by John Lynch.; Much like BREAKING 
THE WAVES, it's a raw, intense, carnal film that will appeal most 
strongly to adventurous movie-goers.; Actually, it's ironic that the 
very qualities which scared off everyone except Cinepix Film Properties 
are those that give ANGEL BABY its unique identity and make it such a 
compelling viewing experience.; There are many magnificent scenes of them showing their love
for each other in a sensitive and witty way, also showing how fragile
and insecure they are.","Its endearingly scrappy look
is matched by its throwaway dialogue - I can imagine this being the
kind of cartoon Robert Altman might produce.; Most would have been content to let them overact so they could have
complete artistic freedom.; It is not rated but would get an R for the
sex, nudity, and profanity.; The director-writer, Rymer, makes sure that
our sympathies lie entirely with the struggling couple without making
the outsiders into monsters.; There's also the nominal lead
character Ralph, a thing that looks like an extra from YELLOW
SUBMARINE (voice actor Lorenzo Music)."
1214871.0,Onegin,1993.0,"What is most amazing about Ralph Fiennes' performance is his subtle
physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch.; Fiennes is perfectly cast as the frosty Onegin.; Soon after, tragedy strikes, and Onegin
makes himself scarce.; Onegin was actually filmed twice before, in
1911 as a silent Russian short and in 1959 as a Russian feature, but is
probably best known in this country as a Tchaikovsky overture.; An Oscar nominee last year, Remi Adefarasin
provides chilly camera work and has now had the pleasure of working with
four of the Fiennes (sibling Joseph dulled up the joint in Elizabeth).","Try Juno for FREE -- then it's just $9.95/month if you act NOW!; How do you depict the utter boredom that
characters in the story are feeling without making the movie
itself a bore?; Poor Remi probably had to be talked down off of the roof after this one,
muttering that `Ralph' is supposed to be pronounced with the `L.' They say that a decent English translation of Pushkin's poem has never
existed and Onegin does nothing but perpetuate the myth.; He adds up to nothing,
unfortunately, because he is an idler who presumably goes
through women with the same boredom with which he
surveys the snowy Russian landscape.; The picture is
slow-moving, Masterpiece-Theatre style, so that the MTV
generation would find it excruciating if any of its
representatives mistakenly wandered into the wrong screen
on the way to ""Galaxy Quest."""
1224743.0,Home Alone,1996.0,"It's a lot of fun, and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of
the movie.; It's interesting that, in a subtle way, his parents never noticed him
missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from
their children.; Looking brave, wise, and yet vulnerable,
Culkin is perfect for the role.; Looking brave, wise, and yet vulnerable,
Culkin is perfect for the role.; But that said, it is fairly impressive that Hughes
and Chris Columbus could piece together such a movie with such craft
that it not only avoids nauseating the audience but actually gets them
rolling in the aisles at times.","Too bad Kevin's adversaries had to be so
terminally stupid - the rest of the picture isn't.; Too bad Kevin's adversaries had to be so
terminally stupid - the rest of the picture isn't.; It's not trash, it's just not great.; Yes, he's funny, and he has
some great bits, but as a whole, he just didn't pack it.; I am a little leery of John Hughes films ... Hughes' movies seem
to be exclusively devoted to the topic of comfortable-middle-class-
white-American family life--not that there's anything inherently wrong
with that, it's just that when it's not properly handled it's about as
interesting as Wonder Bread."
1235634.0,Roommates,2001.0,"ROOMMATES certainly isn't as good as it might
have been, but it represents a game try at a different perspective on
life and love, and offers an opportunity (for those so inclined) to
shed a few tears.; A tense exchange between Beth and Rocky
is very well handled by both Julianne Moore and Falk, and highlights
everything that was most promising about the idea for ROOMMATES.; For a
while, ROOMMATES makes the most of the comic possibilities inherent
in a young, single man sharing a small room with a very
old-fashioned old man.; Make no mistake, Falk's performance
as Rocky is entertaining; he delivers his Old World wisdom with wit
and bite.; When Michael brings Beth home, Rocky makes
no secret of his disapproval of pre-marital sex, and it is
refreshing that his point of view is given a certain amount of
respect by the filmmakers.","Comprised of all the pieces
that are supposed to work, ROOMMATES doesn't work because it lacks a
cohesive story to complement Peter Falk's engaging performance.; It
certainly does not help that D. B. Sweeney seems to be dazed and
bored through most of the film's running time.; That is a noble goal, but it simply
does not work as a movie because there is never a clear enough sense
of what this relationship is really supposed to be about.; But for over an
hour, it is little more than a bad soap opera:  drawn-out, confused
and maudlin.; After a while, the plot
jerks onto another tangent, this one spending far too much time
focused on a custody battle and movie-of-the-week style family
squabbling."
1249037.0,Dracula,1938.0,"Bram  Stoker's novel is a chilling Gothic horror, recommended
reading for everyone.; plays Renfield, and does an amazing job
with him.; Oldman is a wonderfully powerful vampire.; It is worth seeing.; Coppola's hand is evident throughout, and Oldman's performance
is compelling enough that I have no doubts the movie will be successful.","Winona Ryder is disappointing.; By far the worst
performance in the movie.; He is completely dull, and seems to
be walking through the role from start to finish.; Her performance is not poor, but
it is uninspired.; Keanu Reeves is just dreadful."
1253283.0,Green Fire,1978.0,"Edgecomb and his fellow guards Brutus (David
Morse), Dean (Barry Pepper) and Harry (Jeffrey DeMunn) treat the
prisoners with an aspect of respect.; He is astonishing in his
role and deserves a nod come Oscar time.; The story is honest and will crawl into
your heart.; It's a time of miracles and compassion for fellow beings.; Repentant, insane, guilty, innocent; they
all meet their final fate at the end of the ""green mile,"" so-named
because of the floor color where the condemned walk their final mile.","An absolutely abominable electrocution has
the audience gripping their armrests in horror.; They are about to execute
a supposedly-innocent man who can heal any illness.; He has to duck to walk
through doorways.; He's a big black man and we're
going to kill him again -- this time in the electric chair.; Subtlety is not this
movie's strong point."
1283338.0,Election,2000.0,"Highly recommended.; It also
boasts one of my favorite performances of the year - from the wondrous fireball
of energy known as Reese Witherspoon.; I love this movie.; It's brutal, it's funny, it's
brilliant.; It's a sharp, funny and entertaining movie
that will keep you laughing from the opening reel to the closing credits.","But ELECTION is too smart to be derailed by this problem, too
clear-eyed in its study of good intentions muddled by psychological
baggage.; This year, we have
the unlikely teenage political satire ELECTION, which is the first
mildly ambitious film from the folks at MTV Films, but even that
cannot fully save the movie itself.; If you're old enough to have experienced high school, 
you've definately run into someone like Tracey.; Rated R. It comes as a walloping disappointment to moi that Election is being
actively marketed as the latest derivative teen flick.; Forget FERRIS BUELLER; Matthew Broderick is a bad, bad actor, and
his performance in ELECTION proves my point exactly."
1294927.0,Murder in the First,1987.0,"Oldman nearly always turns in a terrific performance, and
as the sadistic Glenn he is genuinely chilling.; This is a powerful message film at a time when most films'
strongest statement is political correctness.; The script by Dan
Gordon has a strong anti-establishment message and a powerful noir-ish
tone.; MURDER IN THE FIRST is a harrowing and powerful drama
set in a Kafkaesque world of omnipresent abuses of power and trust.; Little that occurs towards the end to affect a false sense of
dramatic closure reduces the power of bearing witness to the exposure
of Henri Young's soul--or what's left after Glenn and Alcatraz have
finished with it.","were corralled into this mess.; It's not a bad
film; it's just lazy, a classic example of a writer and director
failing to make the most of an idea's potential.; But the worst feeling you get while watching MURDER IN THE FIRST
is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good
story.; But director Marc Rocco makes it clear from the beginning that
pretentious, often nauseating, camera movements and slick, MTV- style
lighting and editing are far more important.; In fact, director Marc
Rocco doesn't really go far enough."
1297582.0,King Kong,1999.0,"Though it is perhaps in our nature to embrace this film because
of what it represents, and because of its role in motion picture
history, those who deny KING KONG's flaws deny reality.; Ultimately, the mystique of KING KONG lies not so
much in what it offers today, but what it has contributed during the
course of the last six decades.; The story stands up pretty well today.; State-of-the-art visual effects, an entertaining story, and
a touching ending combined to bequeath upon this film the coveted label
of a ""classic.""; Sometimes, it's not always the best thing to re-watch an older,
well-beloved movie.","Since I've made my point about the clumsiness of
the story, I'll fast forward through the synopsis.; The script
isn't good enough, full of cliches and one-dimensional
characters.; Armstrong
hires her without any knowledge of her character,
experience, or acting ability.; A scene which had crew
members devoured by giant spiders had to be deleted
from the film, as it horrified a preview audience.; A film crew headed by Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong)
arrives at the mysterious Skull Island to do some location shooting for
a new picture."
1315322.0,Sleepers,1998.0,"Overall, Sleepers is well worth seeing, in spite of its flaws.; The
story is riveting; the cinematography, excellent and the direction,
engrossing.; The
story is riveting; the cinematography, excellent and the direction,
engrossing.; On that day they start to commit the
pettiest of petty crimes, but their plan goes awry in arguably the most
powerful sequence in the picture and one of the best this year.; It is a stretch that things go soo smoothly, and this is my only fault with 
the film.","The
pacing is terrible; if Levinson insisted on making a film this long
(two-and-a-half hours) he should have spent the time developing the
characters instead of showing us redundant flashbacks and silly scenes
which further complicate the plot.; Based on the supposedly non-fictional
book by Lorenzo Carcaterras (it's difficult to believe, for starters,
that Carcaterras and his friends look like Patric and Pitt), the film
offers very little in the way of tension or drama, and even resorts to
such tired devices as (flat, obvious) narration to make sense of the
complicated--but by no means involving-- plot.; Molestation and pedophilia are very serious issues that have been
fashioned here into a story as perfunctory and pointless as a TV
movie-of-the-week.; But that's a moot point compared
to the script's central problem: we don't care about any of these
people, or whether they triumph in the end, because their
personalities are interchangeable and ultimately unappealing.; The Cliff's Notes version of the film would be ""revenge,"" but if
that makes you think of some cheap Charles Bronson action flick, then
think again."

gift she enjoys most, is the small motorboat that is moored in the

an ex-cop, the hulking Mack MacDonald (Burr).; There was also one scene where Tommy had a nightmare and Powell glibly
explains this away because he read a comic book with an alien story
before going to sleep."
1353328.0,Hook,1997.0,"Hoffman *is* Captain Hook, mixing the perfect amount of evil
and cowardice to the role while Smith, Korsmo, Scott, and Bob Hoskins as Smee
are all wonderful and damn-near flawless.; I've seen some of the
     early rushes of Hoffman playing Hook, and it's *incredible*!; HOOK is one of the best films I have seen in a long time!; The
special effects are well done and the story, except in a couple of
places, is very well done.; The sets were really well made, especially the ones for
TinkerBell.","TWO: It's a dumb, shallow story.; Nor can
     it cover up a ridiculous premise or a silly, illogical, treacly
     script full of saccharine, empty sentimentality in place of
     genuine feeling.; She's annoying and although she's probably
supposed to maintain a sense of youth and playfulness being a pixie and all,
she comes off more like some kid overly eager to charm us.; This script doesn't do the job on *any* of
     those requirements.; TWO: Oh, really?"
1363371.0,Kiss Me Kate,1999.0,"Lilli is 
temperamental and a spitfire, but still capable of great affection if a man 
proves himself worthy of it.; And it is the genius of ""Kiss Me Kate"" -- 
both the play and the film -- that we feel the story's happy resolution on 
two levels at once: Between Petruchio and Katharine, and between Fred and 
Lilli.; As was customary in M-G-M musicals in the Golden Age, the best number 
is saved for last; and a delectable treat it is.; Today, ""Too Darn Hot"" is usually cited as ""the definitive Ann 
Miller number"" by fans of her musicals.; This is 
Bob Fosse's turf: We see Fosse and the wonderfully agile Carol Haney take 
center stage in a finger-snapping, back-flipping, jazzy interlude that sets 
the screen ablaze.","Fans of Stephen Sondheim
may say with their noses in the air that the absence of
melody nowadays is a plus--that easy-to-mimic tunes are not
only dated but simple-minded--but this rejoiner comes across
as sour grapes.; Fans of Stephen Sondheim
may say with their noses in the air that the absence of
melody nowadays is a plus--that easy-to-mimic tunes are not
only dated but simple-minded--but this rejoiner comes across
as sour grapes.; Howard Keel's Fred is self-absorbed and vainglorious, but at least he 
isn't the insufferable ham played by Alfred Drake in the stage play.; Complicating matters is the presence of a supporting actress, Lois 
Lane (Ann Miller), who is to play Bianca, the younger sister of Katharine.; 6 sec., but for that one 
minute the screen is on fire."
1388808.0,Into the Deep,1984.0,"A beautiful kelp forest climbs to the surface in
startling 3-D, a lobster grows a new shell, squid mating season, these are just
some of the images that are presented.; While I don't
recomend Into the Deep, I still think that some of the pictures in it are worth
seeing.; It's all about
the entertainment value and quality, it's an event.; The squid mating thing is cool and the millions of fish that surround
the camera crew in the end are neat as well.; This 35-minute film ventures down deep into the ocean to uncover a world that
is quite unknown to man.","One
minute we are learning about sea urchins and then they are wrapping it up
giving us some all humans are connected to the ocean junk.; Nothing at all
stood out from the screen that often to make wearing those heavy and awkward
glasses worthwhile.; But for being a heavily-hyped 3-D film,
I didn't feel that the film really needed to be in 3-D at all.; Into The
Deep is a new 3-D IMAX movie that is anything but what I listed above, except
for the boring narrator.; The whole concept of
entertaining the audience is lost."
1400562.0,Fear,,"He
completely captured all the goodness, and badness, of the main
character of this film, and always kept me wanting to see more and more
of him (his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core
target audience, as ""best villain"" at the 1997 MTV Movie Awards).; Fun ensues.; Mark Wahlberg stands 5""9, is born in Massachusetts, dropped out of
highschool (later got his GED), and was convicted of several minor
felonies before starting his career as the lead singer of Marky Mark
and the Funky Bunch.; The soundtrack is also very effective in this setting, and of course,
the slutty performance by Alyssa Milano is something we could all
indulge in (look for the nice bikini and butt shots...if you're into
that kind of thing, that is :).; Mind you, I
still can't tell if Reese Witherspoon is good looking or a douchebag,
but hey, life goes on.","CRITIQUE:
Ever wonder what would happen if your better half turned out to be
someone other than the person that you had come to cherish and love?; Boy goes nuts.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due

1437292.0,Whore,1995.0,"If
some of her stories seem contrived, it is because that is the way she
remembers them.; It's doubtful that Ken Russell had the Theatre of Cruelty in mind, but
this is in effect what he accomplishes.; Kathleen Turner as China Blue found
prostitution a creative and fulfilling art that blesses her that gives and
him that gets.; The closest film piece to this work (that I can think of) is TALK
RADIO directed by Oliver Stone and starring Eric Bogosian.; By the end of the film we are no longer sure that
we have not crossed over into a story that Liz is telling herself.","When the film had its theatrical release, there was nothing much
good that was said about it, save for very early on.; The characters bored me.; I thought SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE was dry and
dull.; There is an old saying which goes something like ""The worst sex I
ever had was still pretty good.""; WHORE seems to a sort of penance on the part of director Ken Russell."
1441966.0,Take the Money and Run,1995.0,"He blew into 
it (works).; The man is a genius for manufacturing 
premises that lead to a variety of joke-producing situations, 
although this movie has its share of classic moments, that 
genius isn't as fully developed in TAKE THE MONEY AND 
RUN as his comedies of the early 70's.; As always, there are 
opportunities aplenty for jokes, both verbal and visual, mixed 
together expertly like only he can.; A lot of the other early Allen films had that 
kind of feel to them, movies like BANANAS and SLEEPER.; The movie alternates between the ones that are funny 
and that aren't while always being watchable.","And after thirty I had completely given up the idea 
of stealing her purse.""; It wouldn't be a Woody Allen movie if he didn't work 
romance in somehow.; In this mock documentary 
satirizing the crime films of the 30's (and of course 1967's BONNIE 
AND CLYDE), Woody plays the most inept criminal on the planet, 
the kind of guy who robs a bank by giving the teller a letter reading, 
""I am pointing a gun at you.""; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; But the teller thinks it says ""gub"" and 
calls over another teller to get a second opinion."
1463597.0,Charlie's Angels,1941.0,"I loved it.; Lucy Liu massages a suspect.; The filmmakers are having fun, poking 
fun, with fun music and fun action.; This wonderful contrast displays the film's bold and ballsy breakout 
attitude.; Sam Rockwell hits broad comedic high
notes in two very different modes while the ever reliable Murray settles
for slapstick (and a great prison parody sequence).","It's ridiculous on purpose!; They then begin their pursuit
of the bad guy(s) masquerading as beautiful party women, belly dancers,
Bavarian yodellers and office efficiency experts.; Only Alex' romance with LeBlanc and Barrymore's indulgent
inclusion of Tom Green bog the film down.; She retorts, ""My 
hands aren't going anywhere near your staff.""; I really think so"" or playing the tuba and 
accordion dressed as Swedish barmaids."
1539330.0,Phantoms,1998.0,"The fault certainly doesn't lie with Koontz, who has crafted a superb
companion piece to his excellent novel.; I loved the way the first part of the film was structured.; Peter O'Toole shows up a bit later to assist our
protagonists, as he is a reporter who may or may not know what it is that
they're dealing with.; I loved the way the story was built, hinting on
extraterrestrial activities, forcing the viewer to look at the sky, while
the actual danger comes from the unknown depths of our planet.; Driving into town, they notice that things seem very quiet.","Unfortunately, I was very
disappointed.; They are cut
together very poorly and lit even worse.; The real horror here is Koontz's pathetic dialogue (""Are you okay, 'cuz
I need you to be okay, alright?""; And although it presents
some interesting ideas and some chills, it remains a waste of money and
talent.; However, ultimately the movie fails."
1555248.0,Mean Streets,1998.0,"The finale, which is often criticized but brilliant when
understood, brings about the maturity of Charlie, and also the awakening
of a couple other characters.; To me, this film is about this cusp, and how
life lessons like what happens in this film can help us to grow as
people, and someday mature fully.; With all these tense things going on, as well as his job for one of the
local mafia heads (Cesare Danova), we see Charlie caught in a self-made
cage.; ""Mean Streets"" is told in a breezy, epiodic fashion, allowing us to get
to know the characters in a friendly fashion.; And there are some great brawl
scene taking place in a local pool hall, ending with some bit of gritty
police corruption.","Charlie is kind of dating or pseudo-dating Johnny's cousin, Theresa (Amy
Robinson), who's also on Charlie's case to de-friend Johnny and move
away with her.; The formatting of the review is likely to differ from the original due
to ASCII to HTML conversion.; ""Mean Streets"" deals with Charlie (Harvey Keitel), who is supposed to be
the young Scorsese."
